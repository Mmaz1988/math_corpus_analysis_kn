     Systems of linear equations are common in science and mathematics. These two examples from high school science give a sense of how they arise.  The first example is from Statics. Suppose that we have three objects, we know that one has a mass of 2~kg, and we want to find the two unknown masses. Suppose further that experimentation with a meter stick produces these two balances.      For the masses to balance we must have that the sum of moments on the left equals the sum of moments on the right, where the moment of an object is its mass times its distance from the balance point. That gives a system of two linear equations. $ 40h + 15c = 100 25c = 50+50h $  The second example is from Chemistry. We can mix, under controlled conditions, toluene $_7_8$ and nitric acid $_3$ to produce trinitrotoluene $_7_5_6_3$ along with the byproduct water (conditions have to be very well controlled- trinitrotoluene is better known as TNT). In what proportion should we mix them? The number of atoms of each element present before the reaction $ x{C}_7{H}_8 + y{H}{N}{O}_3 --> z{C}_7{H}_5{O}_6{N}_3 + w{H}_2{O} $ must equal the number present afterward. Applying that in turn to the elements C, H, N, and O gives this system. $ 7x = 7z 8x +1y = 5z+2w 1y = 3z 3y = 6z+1w $  Both examples come down to solving a system of equations. In each system, the equations involve only the first power of each variable. This chapter shows how to solve any such system.                   A linear combination of $ x_1 $, ..., $ x_n $ has the form $ a_1x_1+a_2x_2+a_3x_3+·s+a_nx_n $ where the numbers $ a_1, ... ,a_n in ℝ $ are the combination's coefficients .   A linear equation in the variables $x_1$, ..., $x_n$ has the form $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+a_3x_3+·s+a_nx_n=d$ where $ d in ℝ $ is the constant .  An $ n $-tuple $ (s_1,s_2,... ,s_n) in ℝ^n $ is a solution of, or satisfies, that equation if substituting the numbers $s_1$, ..., $s_n$ for the variables gives a true statement: $a_1s_1+a_2s_2+·s+a_ns_n=d$. A system of linear equations  $ $ a_{1,1}x_1 + a_{1,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{1,n}x_n = d_1 a_{2,1}x_1 + a_{2,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{2,n}x_n = d_2 ... a_{m,1}x_1 + a_{m,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{m,n}x_n = d_m $ $ has the solution $ (s_1,s_2,... ,s_n) $ if that $n$-tuple is a solution of all of the equations.     For example The combination $ 3x_1 + 2x_2 $ of $x_1$ and $x_2$ is linear. The combination $ 3x_1^2 + 2sin(x_2) $ is not linear, nor is $ 3x_1^2 + 2x_2 $.   For example The ordered pair $ (-1,5) $ is a solution of this system. $ $ 3x_1 + 2x_2 = 7 -x_1 + x_2 = 6 $ $ In contrast, $ (5,-1) $ is not a solution.   Finding the set of all solutions is solving the system. We don't need guesswork or good luck, there is an algorithm that always works. This algorithm is Gauss's Method  (or Gaussian elimination  or linear elimination   ).      For example To solve this system $ $ 3x_3 = 9 x_1 + 5x_2 - 2x_3 = 2 (1/3)x_1 + 2x_2 = 3 $ $ we transform it, step by step, until it is in a form that we can easily solve.  The first transformation rewrites the system by interchanging the first and third row. $  grstep( swap row 1 with row 3 ) $ (1/3)x_1 + 2x_2 = 3 x_1 + 5x_2 - 2x_3 = 2 3x_3 = 9 $ $ The second transformation rescales the first row by a factor of~$3$. $  grstep( multiply row 1 by 3 ) $ x_1 + 6x_2 = 9 x_1 + 5x_2 - 2x_3 = 2 3x_3 = 9 $ $ The third transformation is the only nontrivial one in this example. We mentally multiply both sides of the first row by $ -1 $, mentally add that to the second row, and write the result in as the new second row. $ grstep( add $-1$ times row 1 to row 2 ) $ x_1 + 6x_2 = 9 -x_2 - 2x_3 = -7 3x_3 = 9 $ $ These steps have brought the system to a form where we can easily find the value of each variable. The bottom equation shows that $ x_3=3 $. Substituting $3$ for $ x_3 $ in the middle equation shows that $ x_2=1 $. Substituting those two into the top equation gives that $ x_1=3 $. Thus the system has a unique solution; the solution set is {(3,1,3)}.   Most of this subsection and the next one consists of examples of solving linear systems by Gauss's Method, which we will use throughout the book. It is fast and easy. But before we do those examples we will first show that it is also safe: Gauss's Method never loses solutions (any tuple that is a solution to the system before you apply the method is also a solution after), nor does it ever pick up extraneous solutions (any tuple that is not a solution before is also not a solution after).  [Gauss's Method]   If a linear system is changed to another by one of these operations  setlength(sep){0ex}  an equation is swapped with another  an equation has both sides multiplied by a nonzero constant  an equation is replaced by the sum of itself and a multiple of another  then the two systems have the same set of solutions.    Each of the three Gauss's Method operations has a restriction. Multiplying a row by~$ 0 $ is not allowed because obviously that can change the solution set. Similarly, adding a multiple of a row to itself is not allowed because adding~$ -1 $ times the row to itself has the effect of multiplying the row by~$ 0 $. We disallow swapping a row with itself to make some results in the fourth chapter easier, and also because it's pointless.   We will cover the equation swap operation here. The other two cases are .   Consider a linear system. $ $ a_{1,1}x_1 + a_{1,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{1,n}x_n = d_1 ... a_{i,1}x_1 + a_{i,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{i,n}x_n = d_i ... a_{j,1}x_1 + a_{j,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{j,n}x_n = d_j ... a_{m,1}x_1 + a_{m,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{m,n}x_n = d_m $ $ The tuple $ (s_1,...,s_n) $ satisfies this system if and only if substituting the values for the variables, the $s$'s for the $x$'s, gives a conjunction of true statements: $a_{1,1}s_1+a_{1,2}s_2+·s+a_{1,n}s_n=d_1$ and ...\ $a_{i,1}s_1+a_{i,2}s_2+·s+a_{i,n}s_n=d_i$ and ... $a_{j,1}s_1+a_{j,2}s_2+·s+a_{j,n}s_n=d_j$ and ... $a_{m,1}s_1+a_{m,2}s_2+·s+a_{m,n}s_n=d_m$.    In a list of statements joined with `and' we can rearrange the order of the statements. Thus this requirement is met if and only if $a_{1,1}s_1+a_{1,2}s_2+·s+a_{1,n}s_n=d_1$ and ... $a_{j,1}s_1+a_{j,2}s_2+·s+a_{j,n}s_n=d_j$ and ... $a_{i,1}s_1+a_{i,2}s_2+·s+a_{i,n}s_n=d_i$ and ... $a_{m,1}s_1+a_{m,2}s_2+·s+a_{m,n}s_n=d_m$. This is exactly the requirement that $ (s_1,...,s_n) $ solves the system after the row swap.      The three operations from  are the definend{elementary reduction operations},  or row operations , or Gaussian operations. They are swapping , multiplying by a scalar (or rescaling ), and row combination .    When writing out the calculations, we will abbreviate `row $i$' by `$ ρ_i $'. For instance, we will denote a row combination operation by $ kρ_i+ρ_j $, with the row that changes written second. To save writing we will often combine addition steps when they use the same $ρ_i$ as in the next example.  For example Gauss's Method systematically applies the row operations to solve a system. Here is a typical case. $ $ x + y = 0 2x - y + 3z = 3 x - 2y - z = 3 $ $ We begin by using the first row to eliminate the $2x$ in the second row and the $x$ in the third. To get rid of the $2x$ we mentally multiply the entire first row by $-2$, add that to the second row, and write the result in as the new second row. To eliminate the~$x$ in the third row we multiply the first row by $-1$, add that to the third row, and write the result in as the new third row. $ for step $-2ρ_1 +ρ_2$ $ x + y = 0 -3y + 3z = 3 -3y - z = 3 $ $  We finish by transforming the second system into a third, where the bottom equation involves only one unknown. We do that by using the second row to eliminate the $y$~term from the third row. $ for step $-ρ_2 +ρ_3$ $ x + y = 0 -3y + 3z = 3 -4z = 0 $ $ Now finding the system's solution is easy. The third row gives $ z=0 $. Substitute that back  into the second row to get $ y=-1 $. Then substitute back into the first row to get $ x=1 $.   For example For the Physics problem from the start of this chapter, Gauss's Method gives this. $ $ 40h + 15c = 100 -50h + 25c = 50 $ for step $5/4ρ_1 +ρ_2$ $ 40h + 15c = 100 (175/4)c = 175 $ $ So $ c=4 $, and back-substitution gives that $ h=1 $. (We will solve the Chemistry problem later.)   For example The reduction $ $ x + y + z = 9 2x + 4y - 3z = 1 3x + 6y - 5z = 0 $ for step $-2ρ_1 +ρ_2$ $ x + y + z = 9 2y - 5z = -17 3y - 8z = -27 $ for step $-(3/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ x + y + z = 9 2y - 5z = -17 -(1/2)z = -(3/2) $ $ shows that $ z=3 $, $ y=-1 $, and $ x=7 $.   As illustrated above, the point of Gauss's Method is to use the elementary reduction operations to set up back-substitution.    In each row of a system, the first variable with a nonzero coefficient is the row's leading variable . A system is in echelon form if each leading variable is to the right of the leading variable in the row above it, except for the leading variable in the first row, and any all-zero rows are at the bottom.    For example The prior three examples only used the operation of row combination. This linear system requires the swap operation to get it into echelon form because after the first combination $ $ x - y = 0 2x - 2y + z + 2w = 4 y + w = 0 2z + w = 5 $ for step $-2ρ_1 +ρ_2$ $ x - y = 0 z + 2w = 4 y + w = 0 2z + w = 5 $ $ the second equation has no leading $y$. We exchange it for a lower-down row that has a leading $y$. $ for step $ρ_2 ↔ρ_3$ $ x - y = 0 y + w = 0 z + 2w = 4 2z + w = 5 $ $ (Had there been more than one suitable row below the second then we could have used any one.) With that, Gauss's Method proceeds as before. $ for step $-2ρ_3 +ρ_4$ $ x - y = 0 y + w = 0 z + 2w = 4 -3w = -3 $ $ Back-substitution gives $ w=1 $, $ z=2 $ , $ y=-1 $, and $ x=-1 $.   Strictly speaking, to solve linear systems we don't need the row rescaling operation. We have introduced it here because it is convenient and because we will use it later in this chapter as part of a variation of Gauss's Method, the Gauss-Jordan Method.  All of the systems so far have the same number of equations as unknowns. All of them have a solution and for all of them there is only one solution. We finish this subsection by seeing other things that can happen.  For example This system has more equations than variables. $ $ x + 3y = 1 2x + y = -3 2x + 2y = -2 $ $ Gauss's Method helps us understand this system also, since this $ for step $-2ρ_1 +ρ_2$ $ x + 3y = 1 -5y = -5 -4y = -4 $ $ shows that one of the equations is redundant. Echelon form $ for step $-(4/5)ρ_2 +ρ_3$ $ x + 3y = 1 -5y = -5 0 = 0 $ $ gives that $ y=1 $ and $ x=-2 $. The `$ 0=0 $' reflects the redundancy.   Gauss's Method is also useful on systems with more variables than equations. The next subsection has many examples.  Another way that linear systems can differ from the examples shown above is that some linear systems do not have a unique solution. This can happen in two ways. The first is that a system can fail to have any solution at all.  For example Contrast the system in the last example with this one. $ $ x + 3y = 1 2x + y = -3 2x + 2y = 0 $ for step $-2ρ_1 +ρ_2$ $ x + 3y = 1 -5y = -5 -4y = -2 $ $ Here the system is inconsistent:~no pair of numbers $(s_1,s_2)$ satisfies all three equations simultaneously. Echelon form makes the inconsistency obvious. $ for step $-(4/5)ρ_2 +ρ_3$ $ x + 3y = 1 -5y = -5 0 = 2 $ $ The solution set is empty.   For example The prior system has more equations than unknowns but that is not what causes the inconsistency-  has more equations than unknowns and yet is consistent. Nor is having more equations than unknowns necessary for inconsistency, as we see with this inconsistent system that has the same number of equations as unknowns. $ $ x + 2y = 8 2x + 4y = 8 $ for step $-2ρ_1 + ρ_2$ $ x + 2y = 8 0 = -8 $ $ Instead, inconsistency has to do with the interaction of the left and right sides; in the first system above the left side's second equation is twice the first but the right side's second constant is not twice the first. Later we will have more to say about dependencies between a system's parts.   The other way that a linear system can fail to have a unique solution, besides having no solutions, is to have many solutions.  For example In this system $ $ x + y = 4 2x + 2y = 8 $ $ any pair of numbers satisfying the first equation also satisfies the second. The solution set  $ { (x,y) such that x+y=4} $ is infinite; some example member pairs are~$(0,4)$, $(-1,5)$, and $(2.5,1.5)$.  The result of applying Gauss's Method here contrasts with the prior example because we do not get a contradictory equation. $ for step $-2ρ_1 + ρ_2$ $ x + y = 4 0 = 0 $ $   Don't be fooled by that example:~a $0=0$ equation is not the signal that a system has many solutions.  For example The absence of a $ 0=0 $ equation does not keep a system from having many different solutions. This system is in echelon form, has no $0=0$, but has infinitely many solutions, including $(0,1,-1)$, $(0,1/2,-1/2)$, $(0,0,0)$, and $(0,-π,π)$ (any triple whose first component is $0$ and whose second component is the negative of the third is a solution). $ $ x + y + z = 0 y + z = 0 $ $  Nor does the presence of $ 0=0 $ mean that the system must have many solutions. shows that. So does this system, which does not have any solutions at all despite that in echelon form it has a $0=0$ row. $ $ 2x - 2z = 6 y + z = 1 2x + y - z = 7 3y + 3z = 0 $ for step $-ρ_1 +ρ_3$ $ 2x - 2z = 6 y + z = 1 y + z = 1 3y + 3z = 0 $ for step $-ρ_2 +ρ_3$ $ 2x - 2z = 6 y + z = 1 0 = 0 0 = -3 $ $   In summary, Gauss's Method uses the row operations to set a system up for back substitution. If any step shows a contradictory equation then we can stop with the conclusion that the system has no solutions. If we reach echelon form without a contradictory equation, and each variable is a leading variable in its row, then the system has a unique solution and we find it by back substitution. Finally, if we reach echelon form without a contradictory equation, and there is not a unique solution- that is, at least one variable is not a leading variable- then the system has many solutions.  The next subsection explores the third case. We will see that such a system must have infinitely many solutions and we will describe the solution set.    Note. textit{Here, and in the rest of the book, you must justify all of your exercise answers. For instance, if a question asks whether a system has a solution then you must justify a yes response by producing the solution and must justify a no response by showing that no solution exists.}   Use Gauss's Method to find the unique solution for each system.   $$ 2x + 3y = 13 x - y = -1 $$  $$ x - z = 0 3x + y = 1 -x + y + z = 4 $$    Gauss's Method $ for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 2x + 3y = 13 - (5/2)y = -15/2 $ $ gives that the solution is $y=3$ and $x=2$. Gauss's Method here $ for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x - z = 0 y + 3z = 1 y = 4 $ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ x - z = 0 y + 3z = 1 -3z = 3 $ $ gives $x=-1$, $y=4$, and $z=-1$.    Use Gauss's Method to solve each system or conclude `many solutions' or `no solutions'.  $ $ 2x + 2y = 5 x - 4y = 0 $ $ $ $ -x + y = 1 x + y = 2 $ $ $ $ x - 3y + z = 1 x + y + 2z = 14 $ $ $ $ -x - y = 1 -3x - 3y = 2 $ $ $ $ 4y + z = 20 2x - 2y + z = 0 x + z = 5 x + y - z = 10 $ $ $ 2x + z + w = 5 y - w = -1 3x - z - w = 0 4x + y + 2z + w = 9 $ $    Gaussian reduction $ for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 2x + 2y = 5 -5y = -5/2 $ $ shows that $ y=1/2 $ and $ x=2 $ is the unique solution. Gauss's Method $ for step $ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ -x + y = 1 2y = 3 $ $ gives $ y=3/2 $ and $ x=1/2 $ as the only solution. Row reduction $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x - 3y + z = 1 4y + z = 13 $ $ shows, because the variable $z$ is not a leading variable in any row, that there are many solutions. Row reduction $ for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ -x - y = 1 0 = -1 $ $ shows that there is no solution. Gauss's Method $ for step $ρ_1↔ρ_4$ $ x + y - z = 10 2x - 2y + z = 0 x + z = 5 4y + z = 20 $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x + y - z = 10 -4y + 3z = -20 -y + 2z = -5 4y + z = 20 $ for step $-(1/4)ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ x + y - z = 10 -4y + 3z = -20 (5/4)z = 0 4z = 0 $ $ gives the unique solution $ (x,y,z)=(5,5,0) $. Here Gauss's Method gives $ for step $-(3/2)ρ_1+ρ_3$ $ 2x + z + w = 5 y - w = -1 - (5/2)z - (5/2)w = -15/2 y - w = -1 $ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_4$ $ 2x + z + w = 5 y - w = -1 - (5/2)z - (5/2)w = -15/2 0 = 0 $ $ which shows that there are many solutions.    We can solve linear systems by methods other than Gauss's. One often taught in high school is to solve one of the equations for a variable, then substitute the resulting expression into other equations. Then we repeat that step until there is an equation with only one variable. From that we get the first number in the solution and then we get the rest with back-substitution. This method takes longer than Gauss's Method, since it involves more arithmetic operations, and is also more likely to lead to errors. To illustrate how it can lead to wrong conclusions, we will use the system $ $ x + 3y = 1 2x + y = -3 2x + 2y = 0 $ $ from .  Solve the first equation for $x$ and substitute that expression into the second equation. Find the resulting $y$. Again solve the first equation for $x$, but this time substitute that expression into the third equation. Find this $y$.  What extra step must a user of this method take to avoid erroneously concluding a system has a solution?   From $x=1-3y$ we get that $2(1-3y)+y=-3$, giving $y=1$. From $x=1-3y$ we get that $2(1-3y)+2y=0$, leading to the conclusion that $y=1/2$.  Users of this method must check any potential solutions by substituting back into all the equations.   For which values of $ k $ are there no solutions, many solutions, or a unique solution to this system? $ $ x - y = 1 3x - 3y = k $ $  Do the reduction $ for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x - y = 1 0 = -3+k $ $ to conclude this system has no solutions if $ k ≠ 3 $ and if $ k=3 $ then it has infinitely many solutions. It never has a unique solution.   This system is not linear in that it says $sin(α)$ instead of $α$ $ $ 2sin(α) - cos(β) + 3tan(γ) = 3 4sin(α) + 2cos(β) - 2tan(γ) = 10 6sin(α) - 3cos(β) + tan(γ) = 9 $ $ and yet we can apply Gauss's Method. Do so. Does the system have a solution?  Let $ x=sin(α) $, $ y=cos(β) $, and $ z=tan(γ) $: $ $ 2x - y + 3z = 3 4x + 2y - 2z = 10 6x - 3y + z = 9 $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 2x - y + 3z = 3 4y - 8z = 4 -8z = 0 $ $ gives $ z=0 $, $ y=1 $, and $ x=2 $. Note that no $ α $ satisfies that requirement.    What conditions must the constants, the $b$'s, satisfy so that each of these systems has a solution? Hint. Apply Gauss's Method and see what happens to the right side.  $ $ x - 3y = b_1 3x + y = b_2 x + 7y = b_3 2x + 4y = b_4 $ $ $ x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = b_1 2x_1 + 5x_2 + 3x_3 = b_2 x_1 + 8x_3 = b_3 $    Gauss's Method $ for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x - 3y = b_1 10y = -3b_1+b_2 10y = -b_1+b_3 10y = -2b_1+b_4 $ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ x - 3y = b_1 10y = -3b_1+b_2 0 = 2b_1-b_2+b_3 0 = b_1-b_2+b_4 $ $ shows that this system is consistent if and only if both $ b_3=-2b_1+b_2 $ and $ b_4=-b_1+b_2 $. Reduction $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = b_1 x_2 - 3x_3 = -2b_1+b_2 -2x_2 + 5x_3 = -b_1+b_3 $ for step $2ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = b_1 x_2 - 3x_3 = -2b_1+b_2 -x_3 = -5b_1+2b_2+b_3 $ $ shows that each of $ b_1 $, $ b_2 $, and $ b_3 $ can be any real number- this system always has a unique solution.    True or false: a system with more unknowns than equations has at least one solution. (As always, to say `true' you must prove it, while to say `false' you must produce a counterexample.)  This system with more unknowns than equations $ $ x + y + z = 0 x + y + z = 1 $ $ has no solution.   Must any Chemistry problem like the one that starts this subsection- a balance the reaction problem- have infinitely many solutions?  Yes. For example, the fact that we can have the same reaction in two different flasks shows that twice any solution is another, different, solution (if a physical reaction occurs then there must be at least one nonzero solution).   Find the coefficients $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ so that the graph of $ f(x)=ax^2+bx+c $ passes through the points $ (1,2) $, $ (-1,6) $, and $ (2,3) $.  Because $ f(1)=2 $, $ f(-1)=6 $, and $ f(2)=3 $ we get a linear system. $ $ 1a + 1b + c = 2 1a - 1b + c = 6 4a + 2b + c = 3 $ $ Gauss's Method $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ a + b + c = 2 -2b = 4 -2b - 3c = -5 $ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ a + b + c = 2 -2b = 4 -3c = -9 $ $ shows that the solution is $ f(x)=1x^2-2x+3 $.  After we note that multiplying a row by~$0$ is not allowed because that could change a solution set. Give an example of a system with solution set~$S_0$ where after multiplying a row by~$0$ the new system has a solution set~$S_1$ and $S_0$ is a proper subset of $S_1$. Give an example where $S_0=S_1$.  Here $S_0={(1,1)}$ $ $ x + y = 2 x - y = 0 $ for step $0ρ_2$ $ x + y = 2 0 = 0 $ $ while $S_1$ is a proper superset because it contains at least two points: $(1,1)$ and~$(2,0)$. In this example the solution set does not change. $ $ x + y = 2 2x + 2y = 4 $ for step $0ρ_2$ $ x + y = 2 0 = 0 $ $   Gauss's Method works by combining the equations in a system to make new equations.  Can we derive the equation $ 3x-2y=5 $ by a sequence of Gaussian reduction steps from the equations in this system? $ $ x + y = 1 4x - y = 6 $ $ Can we derive the equation $ 5x-3y=2 $ with a sequence of Gaussian reduction steps from the equations in this system? $ $ 2x + 2y = 5 3x + y = 4 $ $ Can we derive $ 6x-9y+5z=-2 $ by a sequence of Gaussian reduction steps from the equations in the system? $ $ 2x + y - z = 4 6x - 3y + z = 5 $ $    Yes, by inspection the given equation results from $ -ρ_1+ρ_2 $. No. The pair $ (1,1) $ satisfies the given equation. However, that pair does not satisfy the first equation in the system. Yes. To see if the given row is $ c_1ρ_1+c_2ρ_2 $, solve the system of equations relating the coefficients of $x$, $y$, $z$, and the constants: $ $ 2c_1 + 6c_2 = 6 c_1 - 3c_2 = -9 -c_1 + c_2 = 5 4c_1 + 5c_2 = -2 $ $ and get $c_1=-3$ and $c_2=2$, so the given row is $ -3ρ_1+2ρ_2 $.    Prove that, where $ a,b,...,e $ are real numbers and $ a ≠ 0 $, if $ ax+by=c $ has the same solution set as $ ax+dy=e $ then they are the same equation. What if $ a=0 $?  If $ a ≠ 0 $ then the solution set of the first equation is $ {(x,y) such that x=(c-by)/a} $. Taking $y=0$ gives the solution $(c/a,0)$, and since the second equation is supposed to have the same solution set, substituting into it gives that $a(c/a)+d· 0=e$, so $c=e$. Then taking $y=1$ in $x=(c-by)/a$ gives that $a((c-b)/a)+d· 1=e$, which gives that $b=d$. Hence they are the same equation.  When $ a=0 $ the equations can be different and still have the same solution set:~e.g., $ 0x+3y=6 $ and $ 0x+6y=12 $.   Show that if $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $ then $ $ ax + by = j cx + dy = k $ $ has a unique solution.  We take three cases: that $a ≠ 0$, that $a=0$ and $c ≠ 0$, and that both $a=0$ and $c=0$.  For the first, we assume that $ a ≠ 0 $. Then the reduction $ for step $-(c/a)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ ax + by = j (-(cb/a)+d)y = -(cj/a)+k $ $ shows that this system has a unique solution if and only if $ -(cb/a)+d ≠ 0 $; remember that $ a ≠ 0 $ so that back substitution yields a unique $ x $ (observe, by the way, that $ j $ and $ k $ play no role in the conclusion that there is a unique solution, although if there is a unique solution then they contribute to its value). But $ -(cb/a)+d = (ad-bc)/a $ and a fraction is not equal to $ 0 $ if and only if its numerator is not equal to $ 0 $. Thus, in this first case, there is a unique solution if and only if $ad-bc ≠ 0$.  In the second case, if $ a=0 $ but $ c ≠ 0 $, then we swap $ $ cx + dy = k by = j $ $ to conclude that the system has a unique solution if and only if $ b ≠ 0 $ (we use the case assumption that $ c ≠ 0 $ to get a unique $ x $ in back substitution). But- where $ a=0 $ and $ c ≠ 0 $- the condition ``$ b ≠ 0 $'' is equivalent to the condition ``$ ad-bc ≠ 0 $''. That finishes the second case.  Finally, for the third case, if both $ a $ and $ c $ are $ 0 $ then the system $ $ 0x + by = j 0x + dy = k $ $ might have no solutions (if the second equation is not a multiple of the first) or it might have infinitely many solutions (if the second equation is a multiple of the first then for each $ y $ satisfying both equations, any pair $ (x,y) $ will do), but it never has a unique solution. Note that $ a=0 $ and $ c=0 $ gives that $ ad-bc=0 $.   In the system $ $ ax + by = c dx + ey = f $ $ each of the equations describes a line in the $ xy $-plane. By geometrical reasoning, show that there are three possibilities: there is a unique solution, there is no solution, and there are infinitely many solutions.  Recall that if a pair of lines share two distinct points then they are the same line. That's because two points determine a line, so these two points determine each of the two lines, and so they are the same line.  Thus the lines can share one point (giving a unique solution), share no points (giving no solutions), or share at least two points (which makes them the same line).   Finish the proof of .  For the reduction operation of multiplying $ρ_i$ by a nonzero real number $k$, we have that $ (s_1,...,s_n) $ satisfies this system $ $ a_{1,1}x_1 + a_{1,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{1,n}x_n = d_1 ... ka_{i,1}x_1 + ka_{i,2}x_2 + ·s + ka_{i,n}x_n = kd_i ... a_{m,1}x_1 + a_{m,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{m,n}x_n = d_m $ $ if and only if           $a_{1,1}s_1+a_{1,2}s_2+·s+a_{1,n}s_n=d_1$ and ...{} $ka_{i,1}s_1+ka_{i,2}s_2+·s+ka_{i,n}s_n=kd_i$ and ...{} $a_{m,1}s_1+a_{m,2}s_2+·s+a_{m,n}s_n=d_m$ by the definition of `satisfies'. Because $ k ≠ 0 $, that's true if and only if           $a_{1,1}s_1+a_{1,2}s_2+·s+a_{1,n}s_n=d_1$ and ...{} $a_{i,1}s_1+a_{i,2}s_2+·s+a_{i,n}s_n=d_i$ and ...{} $a_{m,1}s_1+a_{m,2}s_2+·s+a_{m,n}s_n=d_m$ (this is straightforward canceling on both sides of the $i$-th equation), which says that $ (s_1,...,s_n) $ solves $ $ a_{1,1}x_1 + a_{1,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{1,n}x_n = d_1 ... a_{i,1}x_1 + a_{i,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{i,n}x_n = d_i ... a_{m,1}x_1 + a_{m,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{m,n}x_n = d_m $ $ as required.  For the combination operation $kρ_i+ρ_j$, the tuple $ (s_1,...,s_n) $ satisfies $ $ a_{1,1}x_1 + ·s + a_{1,n}x_n = d_1 ... a_{i,1}x_1 + ·s + a_{i,n}x_n = d_i ... (ka_{i,1}+a_{j,1})x_1 + ·s + (ka_{i,n}+a_{j,n})x_n = kd_i+d_j ... a_{m,1}x_1 + ·s + a_{m,n}x_n = d_m $ $ if and only if $a_{1,1}s_1+·s+a_{1,n}s_n=d_1$ and ...{} $a_{i,1}s_1+·s+a_{i,n}s_n=d_i$ and ...{} $(ka_{i,1}+a_{j,1})s_1+·s+(ka_{i,n}+a_{j,n})s_n=kd_i+d_j$ and ...{} $a_{m,1}s_1+a_{m,2}s_2+·s+a_{m,n}s_n=d_m$ again by the definition of `satisfies'. Subtract $ k $ times the equation~$ i $ from equation~$ j $. (Here is where we need $ i ≠ j $; if $ i=j $ then the two $ d_i $'s above are not equal.) The previous compound statement holds if and only if $a_{1,1}s_1+·s+a_{1,n}s_n=d_1$ and ...{} $a_{i,1}s_1+·s+a_{i,n}s_n=d_i$ and...{} $ (ka_{i,1}+a_{j,1})s_1+·s+(ka_{i,n}+a_{j,n})s_n -(ka_{i,1}s_1+·s+ka_{i,n}s_n) =kd_i+d_j-kd_i$ and...{} $a_{m,1}s_1+·s+a_{m,n}s_n=d_m$, which after cancellation says that $ (s_1,...,s_n) $ solves $ $ a_{1,1}x_1 + ·s + a_{1,n}x_n = d_1 ... a_{i,1}x_1 + ·s + a_{i,n}x_n = d_i ... a_{j,1}x_1 + ·s + a_{j,n}x_n = d_j ... a_{m,1}x_1 + ·s + a_{m,n}x_n = d_m $ $ as required.   Is there a two-unknowns linear system whose solution set is all of $ ℝ^2 $?  Yes, this one-equation system: $ 0x+0y=0 $ is satisfied by every $ (x,y) in ℝ^2 $.   Are any of the operations used in Gauss's Method redundant? That is, can we make any of the operations from a combination of the others?  Yes. This sequence of operations swaps rows $ i $ and $ j $ $ for step $ρ_i+ρ_j$ repeat step $-ρ_j+ρ_i$ repeat step $ρ_i+ρ_j$ repeat step $-1ρ_i$ $ so the row-swap operation is redundant in the presence of the other two.   Prove that each operation of Gauss's Method is reversible. That is, show that if two systems are related by a row operation $S_1-> S_2$ then there is a row operation to go back $S_2-> S_1$.  Reverse a row swap $ρ_i↔ρ_j$ by swapping back $ρ_j↔ρ_i$. Reverse the $kρ_i$ step of multiplying $ k ≠ 0 $ on both sides of a row by dividing through~$(1/k)ρ_i$.  The row combination case is the nontrivial one. The operation $kρ_i+ρ_j$ results in this $j$-th row. $ k· a_{i,1}+a_{j,1}+·s+k· a_{i,n}+a_{j,n}=k· d_i+d_j $ The $i$-th row unchanged because of the $i ≠ j$ restriction. Because the $i$-th row is unchanged, the operation $-kρ_i+ρ_j$ returns the $j$-th row to its original state.  (Observe that the $ i=j $ conditino on the $kρ_i+ρ_j$ is needed, or else this could happen $ $ 3x + 2y = 7 $ for step $2ρ_1+ρ_1$ $ 9x + 6y = 21 $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_1$ $ -9x - 6y = -21 $ $ and so the result wouldn't hold.)    A box holding pennies, nickels and dimes contains thirteen coins with a total value of $ 83 $ cents. How many coins of each type are in the box? (These are US coins; a penny is $1$~cent, a nickel is $5$~cents, and a dime is $10$~cents.)  Let $ p $, $ n $, and $ d $ be the number of pennies, nickels, and dimes. For variables that are real numbers, this system $ $ p + n + d = 13 p + 5n + 10d = 83 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ p + n + d = 13 4n + 9d = 70 $ $ has more than one solution; in fact, it has infinitely many of them. However, it has a limited number of solutions in which $ p $, $ n $, and $ d $ are non-negative integers. Running through $ d=0 $, ..., $ d=8 $ shows that $ (p,n,d)=(3,4,6) $ is the only solution using natural numbers.    Four positive integers are given. Select any three of the integers, find their arithmetic average, and add this result to the fourth integer. Thus the numbers 29, 23, 21, and 17 are obtained. One of the original integers is:  19 21 23 29 17   Solving the system $ $ (1/3)(a+b+c) + d = 29 (1/3)(b+c+d) + a = 23 (1/3)(c+d+a) + b = 21 (1/3)(d+a+b) + c = 17 $ $ we obtain $a=12$, $b=9$, $c=3$, $d=21$. Thus the second item, 21, is the correct answer.    Laugh at this: $ AHAHA+TEHE=TEHAW $. It resulted from substituting a code letter for each digit of a simple example in addition, and it is required to identify the letters and prove the solution unique.   A comparison of the units and hundreds columns of this addition shows that there must be a carry from the tens column. The tens column then tells us that $ A<H $, so there can be no carry from the units or hundreds columns. The five columns then give the following five equations. $ A+E = W 2H = A+10 H = W+1 H+T = E+10 A+1 = T $ The five linear equations in five unknowns, if solved simultaneously, produce the unique solution: $ A=4 $, $ T=5 $, $ H=7 $, $ W=6 $ and $ E=2 $, so that the original example in addition was $ 47474+5272=52746 $.    The Wohascum County Board of Commissioners, which has 20 members, recently had to elect a President. There were three candidates ($A$, $B$, and $C$); on each ballot the three candidates were to be listed in order of preference, with no abstentions. It was found that 11 members, a majority, preferred $A$ over $B$ (thus the other 9 preferred $B$ over $A$). Similarly, it was found that 12 members preferred $C$ over $A$. Given these results, it was suggested that $B$ should withdraw, to enable a runoff election between $A$ and $C$. However, $B$ protested, and it was then found that 14 members preferred $B$ over $C$! The Board has not yet recovered from the resulting confusion. Given that every possible order of $A$, $B$, $C$ appeared on at least one ballot, how many members voted for $B$ as their first choice?  {} Some additional material was added from . Eight commissioners voted for $B$. To see this, we will use the given information to study how many voters chose each order of $A$, $B$, $C$.  The six orders of preference are $ABC$, $ACB$, $BAC$, $BCA$, $CAB$, $CBA$; assume they receive $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, $f$ votes respectively. We know that $ $ a + b + e = 11 d + e + f = 12 a + c + d = 14 $ $ from the number preferring $A$ over $B$, the number preferring $C$ over $A$, and the number preferring $B$ over $C$. Because 20 votes were cast, $a+b+·s+f=20$. Subtracting the sum of the three above equations from the prior equation gives $b+c+f=3$, and because each preference order got at least one vote (and vote totals are natural numbers), that means $b=c=f=1$.  From the above three equations the complete solution is then $a=6$, $b=1$, $c=1$, $d=7$, $e=4$, and~$f=1$. The number of commissioners voting for $B$ as their first choice is therefore $c+d=1+7=8$.   The answer to this question would have been the same had we known only that {m at least} 14 commissioners preferred $B$ over $C$.  The seemingly paradoxical nature of the commissioner's preferences ($A$ is preferred to $B$, and $B$ is preferred to $C$, and $C$ is preferred to $A$), an example of ``non-transitive dominance'', is not uncommon when individual choices are pooled.    ``This system of $ n $ linear equations with $ n $ unknowns,'' said the Great Mathematician, ``has a curious property.''  ``Good heavens!'' said the Poor Nut, ``What is it?''  ``Note,'' said the Great Mathematician, ``that the constants are in arithmetic progression.''  ``It's all so clear when you explain it!'' said the Poor Nut. ``Do you mean like $ 6x+9y=12 $ and $ 15x+18y=21 $?''  ``Quite so,'' said the Great Mathematician, pulling out his bassoon. ``Indeed, the system has a unique solution. Can you find it?''  ``Good heavens!'' cried the Poor Nut, ``I am baffled.''  Are you?   textit{We have not used ``dependent'' yet; it means here that Gauss's Method shows that there is not a unique solution.} If $ n≥ 3 $ the system is dependent and the solution is not unique. Hence $ n<3 $. But the term ``system'' implies $ n>1 $. Hence $ n=2 $. If the equations are $ $ ax + (a+d)y = a+2d (a+3d)x + (a+4d)y = a+5d $ $ then $ x=-1 $, $ y=2 $.           A linear system with a unique solution has a solution set with one element. A linear system with no solution has a solution set that is empty. In these cases the solution set is easy to describe. Solution sets are a challenge to describe only when they contain many elements.  For example This system has many solutions because in echelon form $ $ 2x + z = 3 x - y - z = 1 3x - y = 4 $ for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 2x + z = 3 -y - (3/2)z = -1/2 -y - (3/2)z = -1/2 $ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ 2x + z = 3 -y - (3/2)z = -1/2 0 = 0 $ $ not all of the variables are leading variables. shows that an $(x,y,z)$ satisfies the first system if and only if it satisfies the third. So we can describe the solution set ${(x,y,z) such that {$2x+z=3$ and $x-y-z=1$ and $3x-y=4$}$ in this way. $ {(x,y,z) such that {$2x+z=3$ and $-y-3z/2=-1/2$}  $ This description is better because it has two equations instead of three but it is not optimal because it still has some hard to understand interactions among the variables.  To improve it, use the variable that does not lead any equation, $z$, to describe the variables that do lead, $x$ and $y$. The second equation gives $y=(1/2)-(3/2)z$ and the first equation gives $x=(3/2)-(1/2)z$. Thus we can describe the solution set in this way. $ { (x,y,z)= ((3/2)-(1/2)z,(1/2)-(3/2)z,z) such that z in ℝ}  $   Compared with ($*$), the advantage of ($**$) is that $z$ can be any real number. This makes the job of deciding which tuples are in the solution set much easier. For instance, taking $z=2$ shows that $(1/2,-5/2,2)$ is a solution.    In an echelon form linear system the variables that are not leading are free.    For example Reduction of a linear system can end with more than one variable free. Gauss's Method on this system $ $ x + y + z - w = 1 y - z + w = -1 3x + 6z - 6w = 6 -y + z - w = 1 $ for step $-3ρ_1 +ρ_3$ $ x + y + z - w = 1 y - z + w = -1 -3y + 3z - 3w = 3 -y + z - w = 1 $ for step $3ρ_2 +ρ_3$ $ x + y + z - w = 1 y - z + w = -1 0 = 0 0 = 0 $ $ leaves $ x $ and $ y $ leading and both $ z $ and~$ w $ free. To get the description that we prefer, we work from the bottom. We first express the leading variable $y$ in terms of $z$ and $w$, as $y=-1+z-w$. Moving up to the top equation, substituting for $y$ gives $x+(-1+z-w)+z-w=1$ and solving for $x$ leaves $x=2-2z+2w$. The solution set $ {(2-2z+2w,-1+z-w,z,w) such that z,w in ℝ}  $ has the leading variables in terms of the variables that are free.   For example The list of leading variables may skip over some columns. After this reduction $ $ 2x - 2y = 0 z + 3w = 2 3x - 3y = 0 x - y + 2z + 6w = 4 $ for step $-(3/2)ρ_1 +ρ_3$ $ 2x - 2y = 0 z + 3w = 2 0 = 0 2z + 6w = 4 $ for step $-2ρ_2 +ρ_4$ $ 2x - 2y = 0 z + 3w = 2 0 = 0 0 = 0 $ $ $x$ and $z$ are the leading variables, not $x$ and~$y$. The free variables are $y$ and~$w$ and so we can describe the solution set as ${ (y,y,2-3w,w) such that y,w in ℝ }$. For instance, $ (1,1,2,0) $ satisfies the system- take $y=1$ and $w=0$. The four-tuple $ (1,0,5,4) $ is not a solution since its first coordinate does not equal its second.    A variable that we use to describe a family of solutions is a parameter.  We say that the solution set in the prior example is parametrized with $y$ and $w$.  (The terms `parameter' and `free variable' do not mean the same thing. In the prior example $y$ and~$w$ are free because in the echelon form system they do not lead while they are parameters because of how we used them to describe the set of solutions. Had we instead rewritten the second equation as $w=2/3-(1/3)z$ then the free variables would still be $y$ and~$w$ but the parameters would be $y$ and~$z$.)  In the rest of this book we will solve linear systems by bringing them to echelon form and then parametrizing with the free variables.  For example This is another system with infinitely many solutions. $ $ x + 2y = 1 2x + z = 2 3x + 2y + z - w = 4 $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x + 2y = 1 -4y + z = 0 -4y + z - w = 1 $ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ x + 2y = 1 -4y + z = 0 -w = 1 $ $ The leading variables are $ x $, $ y $, and $ w $. The variable $ z $ is free. Notice that, although there are infinitely many solutions, the value of $w$ doesn't vary but is constant at $-1$. To parametrize, write $ w $ in terms of $ z $ with $ w=-1+0z $. Then $ y=(1/4)z $. Substitute for $ y $ in the first equation to get $ x=1-(1/2)z $. The solution set is ${(1-(1/2)z,(1/4)z,z,-1) such that z in ℝ}$.   Parametrizing solution sets shows that systems with free variables have infinitely many solutions. For instance, above $z$ takes on all of infinitely many real number values, each associated with a different solution.  We finish this subsection by developing a streamlined notation for linear systems and their solution sets.    An $ N by M $ matrix is a rectangular array of numbers with $ m $~rows and $ n $~columns . Each number in the matrix is an entry .    We usually denote a matrix with an upper case roman letters. For instance, $ A= ([ 1 2.2 5 3 4 -7 ]) $ has $2$~rows and $3$~columns and so is a $ N by M $ matrix. Read that aloud as ``two-by-three''; the number of rows is always given first. (The matrix has parentheses on either side so that when two matrices are adjacent we can tell where one ends and the other begins.) We name matrix entries with the corresponding lower-case letter so that $ a_{2,1}=3 $ is the entry in the second row and first column of the above array. Note that the order of the subscripts matters: $a_{1,2} ≠ a_{2,1}$ since $ a_{1,2}=2.2 $.  We denote the set of all $ N by M $ matrices by $ matspace(_){N by M} $.  We use matrices to do Gauss's Method in essentially the same way that we did it for systems of equations: where a row's leading entry . is its first nonzero entry (if it has one), we perform row operations to arrive at matrix echelon form,  where the leading entry in lower rows are to the right of those in the rows above. We switch to this notation because it lightens the clerical load of Gauss's Method- the copying of variables and the writing of $+$'s and $=$'s.  For example We can abbreviate this linear system $ $ x + 2y = 4 y - z = 0 x + 2z = 4 $ $ with this matrix. $ ([ 1 2 0 4 0 1 -1 0 1 0 2 4 ]) $ The vertical bar reminds a reader of the difference between the coefficients on the system's left hand side and the constants on the right. With a bar, this is an augmented matrix. $ ([ 1 2 0 4 0 1 -1 0 1 0 2 4 ]) for step $-ρ_1 +ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 0 4 0 1 -1 0 0 -2 2 0 ]) for step $2ρ_2 +ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 0 4 0 1 -1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ The second row stands for $y-z=0$ and the first row stands for $x+2y=4$ so the solution set is $ {(4-2z,z,z) such that z in ℝ} $.   Matrix notation also clarifies the descriptions of solution sets. 's ${(2-2z+2w,-1+z-w,z,w) such that z,w in ℝ}$ is hard to read. We will rewrite it to group all of the constants together, all of the coefficients of~$ z $ together, and all of the coefficients of~$ w $ together. We write them vertically, in one-column matrices. $ {[2 -1 0 0] +[-2 1 1 0]· z +[2 -1 0 1]· w such that z,w in ℝ} $ For instance, the top line says that $ x=2-2z+2w $ and the second line says that $ y= -1+z-w $. (Our next section gives a geometric interpretation that will help picture the solution sets.)    A vector (or column vector) is a matrix with a single column. A matrix with a single row is a row vector . The entries of a vector are its components . A column or row vector whose components are all zeros is a zero vector.    Vectors are an exception to the convention of representing matrices with capital roman letters. We use lower-case roman or greek letters overlined with an arrow: $ vec(a) $, $ vec(b) $, ... or $ vec(α) $, $ vec(β) $, ...\ (boldface is also common: {boldmath$ a $} or {boldmath$ α $}). For instance, this is a column vector with a third component of $ 7 $. $ vec(v)= [ 1 3 7] $ A zero vector is denoted $ 0 $. There are many different zero vectors- the one-tall zero vector, the two-tall zero vector, etc.- but nonetheless we will often say ``the'' zero vector, expecting that the size will be clear from the context.   The linear equation $ a_1x_1+a_2x_2+·s+a_nx_n=d $ with unknowns $ x_1,...,x_n $ is satisfied by $ vec(s)=[s_1 ... s_n] $ if $ a_1s_1+a_2s_2+·s+a_ns_n=d $. A vector satisfies a linear system if it satisfies each equation in the system.   The style of description of solution sets that we use involves adding the vectors, and also multiplying them by real numbers. Before we give the examples showing the style we first need to define these operations.    The vector sum of $ vec(u) $ and $ vec(v) $ is the vector of the sums. $ vec(u)+vec(v)= [u_1 ... u_n] + [v_1 ... v_n] = [u_1+v_1 ... u_n+v_n] $    Note that for the addition to be defined the vectors must have the same number of entries. This entry-by-entry addition works for any pair of matrices, not just vectors, provided that they have the same number of rows and columns.    The scalar multiplication of the real number $ r $ and the vector $ vec(v) $ is the vector of the multiples. $ r·vec(v)= r·[v_1 ... v_n] = [rv_1 ... rv_n] $    As with the addition operation, the entry-by-entry scalar multiplication operation extends beyond vectors to apply to any matrix.  We write scalar multiplication either as $ r·vec(v) $ or $ vec(v)· r $, or even without the `$·$' symbol:~$rvec(v)$. (Do not refer to scalar multiplication as `scalar product' because we will use that name for a different operation.)  For example $ [2 3 1] + [3 -1 4] = [2+3 3-1 1+4] = [5 2 5]  7·[1 4 -1 -3] = [7 28 -7 -21] $   Observe that the definitions of addition and scalar multiplication agree where they overlap; for instance, $ vec(v) +vec(v) = 2vec(v) $.  With these definitions, we are set to use matrix and vector notation to both solve systems and express the solution.  For example This system $ $ 2x + y - w = 4 y + w + u = 4 x - z + 2w = 0 $ $ reduces in this way. $ ([ 2 1 0 -1 0 4 0 1 0 1 1 4 1 0 -1 2 0 0 ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_3$ ([ 2 1 0 -1 0 4 0 1 0 1 1 4 0 -1/2 -1 5/2 0 -2 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 2 1 0 -1 0 4 0 1 0 1 1 4 0 0 -1 3 1/2 0 ]) $ The solution set is $ {(w+(1/2)u,4-w-u,3w+(1/2)u,w,u) such that w,u in ℝ} $. We write that in vector form. $ {[x y z w u]= [0 4 0 0 0]+ [1 -1 3 1 0]w+ [1/2 -1 1/2 0 1]u such that w,u in ℝ} $ Note how well vector notation sets off the coefficients of each parameter. For instance, the third row of the vector form shows plainly that if $ u $ is fixed then $ z $ increases three times as fast as $ w $. Another thing shown plainly is that setting both $ w $ and $ u $ to zero gives that $ [x y z w u] =[0 4 0 0 0] $ is a particular solution of the linear system.   For example In the same way, the system $ $ x - y + z = 1 3x + z = 3 5x - 2y + 3z = 5 $ $ reduces $ ([ 1 -1 1 1 3 0 1 3 5 -2 3 5 ]) for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 -1 1 1 0 3 -2 0 0 3 -2 0 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 -1 1 1 0 3 -2 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ to give a one-parameter solution set. $ {[1 0 0] +[-1/3 2/3 1]z such that z in ℝ} $ As in the prior example, the vector not associated with the parameter $ [1 0 0] $ is a particular solution of the system.   Before the exercises, we will consider what we have accomplished and what we have yet to do.  So far we have done the mechanics of Gauss's Method. We have not stopped to consider any of the interesting questions that arise, except for proving - which justifies the method by showing that it gives the right answers.  For example, can we always describe solution sets as above, with a particular solution vector added to an unrestricted linear combination of some other vectors? We've noted that the solution sets we described in this way have infinitely many solutions so an answer to this question would tell us about the size of solution sets.  Many questions arise from our observation that we can do Gauss's Method in more than one way (for instance, when swapping rows we may have a choice of more than one row). says that we must get the same solution set no matter how we proceed but if we do Gauss's Method in two ways must we get the same number of free variables in each echelon form system? Must those be the same variables, that is, is it impossible to solve a problem one way to get $y$ and~$w$ free and solve it another way to get $y$ and~$z$ free?  In the rest of this chapter we will answer these questions. The answer to each is `yes'. In the next subsection we do the first one: we will prove that we can always describe solution sets in that way. Then, in this chapter's second section, we will use that understanding to describe the geometry of solution sets. In this chapter's final section, we will settle the questions about the parameters.  When we are done, we will not only have a solid grounding in the practice of Gauss's Method but we will also have a solid grounding in the theory. We will know exactly what can and cannot happen in a reduction.

Solving for $ y $ gives $ y=(2+2z+w)/3 $ and substitution shows that $ x+2(2+2z+w)/3-z=3 $ so $ x=(5/3)-(1/3)z-(2/3)w $, making this the solution set. $ {[5/3 2/3 0 0] +[-1/3 2/3 1 0]z +[-2/3 1/3 0 1]w such that z,w in ℝ} $ The reduction $ ([ 1 0 1 1 4 2 1 0 -1 2 3 1 1 0 7 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 1 1 4 0 1 -2 -3 -6 0 1 -2 -3 -5 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 1 1 4 0 1 -2 -3 -6 0 0 0 0 1 ]) $ shows that there is no solution- the solution set is empty.    Solve each system using matrix notation.

Solving for $ y $ gives $ y=(1-2z)/(-3) $, and then substitution $ 2x+(1-2z)/(-3)-z=1 $ shows that $ x=((4/3)+(1/3)z)/2 $.

Yes; take $k=-1/2$. No; the system with equations $5=5· j$ and $4=-4· j$ has no solution. Yes; take $r=2$. No. The second components give $k=0$. Then the third components give $j=1$. But the first components don't check.    A farmer with 1200 acres is considering planting three different crops, corn, soybeans, and oats. The farmer wants to use all~$1200$ acres. Seed corn costs $$20$ per acre, while soybean and oat seed cost $$50$ and~$$12$ per acre respectively. The farmer has $$40000$ available to buy seed and intends to spend it all.  Use the information above to formulate two linear equations with three unknowns and solve it. Solutions to the system are choices that the farmer can make. Write down two reasonable solutions. Suppose that in the fall when the crops mature, the farmer can bring in revenue of $$100$ per acre for corn, $$300$ per acre for soybeans and $$80$ per acre for oats. Which of your two solutions in the prior part would have resulted in a larger revenue?    Let $c$ be the number of acres of corn, $s$ be the number of acres of soy, and $a$ be the number of acres of oats. $ $ c + s + a = 1200 20c + 50s + 12a = 40000 $ for step $-20ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ c + s + a = 1200 30s - 8a = 16000 $ $ To describe the solution set we can parametrize using $a$. $ {[c s a] =[20 ,000/30 16 ,000/30 0] +[-38/30 8/30 1]a such that a in ℝ} $ There are many answers possible here. For instance we can take $a=0$ to get $c=20000/30≈ 666.66$ and $s=16000/30≈ 533.33$. Another example is to take $a=20000/38≈ 526.32$, giving $c=0$ and $s=7360/38≈ 193.68$. Plug your answers from the prior part into $100c+300s+80a$.    Parametrize the solution set of this one-equation system. $ x_1+x_2+·s+x_n=0 $  This system has one equation.

Use your answer from the prior part to solve this. $ $ x + 2y - w = 3 2x + z = 1 x + y + 2w = -2 $ $    Gauss's Method here gives $ ([ 1 2 0 -1 a 2 0 1 0 b 1 1 0 2 c ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 0 -1 a 0 -4 1 2 -2a+b 0 -1 0 3 -a+c ]) for step $-(1/4)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 0 -1 a 0 -4 1 2 -2a+b 0 0 -1/4 5/2 -(1/2)a-(1/4)b+c ]) $ leaving $ w $ free. Solve: $ z=2a+b-4c+10w $, and $ -4y=-2a+b-(2a+b-4c+10w)-2w $ so $ y=a-c+3w $, and $ x=a-2(a-c+3w)+w=-a+2c-5w. $ Therefore the solution set is this. $ {[-a+2c a-c 2a+b-4c 0] +[-5 3 10 1]w such that w in ℝ} $ Plug in with $ a=3 $, $ b=1 $, and $ c=-2 $. $ {[-7 5 15 0] +[-5 3 10 1]w such that w in ℝ} $    Why is the comma needed in the notation `$ a_{i,j} $' for matrix entries?  Leaving the comma out, say by writing $ a_{123} $, is ambiguous because it could mean $a_{1,23}$ or $a_{12,3}$.   Give the $ N by N $ matrix whose $ i,j $-th entry is  $ i+j $; $ -1 $ to the $ i+j $ power.    $ ([ 2 3 4 5 3 4 5 6 4 5 6 7 5 6 7 8 ]) $ $ ([ 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 ]) $    For any matrix $ A $, the transpose  of $ A $, written $ Aᵀ $, is the matrix whose columns are the rows of $ A $. Find the transpose of each of these.  $ ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]) $ $ ([ 2 -3 1 1 ]) $ $ ([ 5 10 10 5 ]) $ $ [1 1 0] $    $ ([ 1 4 2 5 3 6 ]) $ $ ([ 2 1 -3 1 ]) $ $ ([ 5 10 10 5 ]) $ $ [1 1 0] $     Describe all functions $ f(x)=ax^2+bx+c $ such that $ f(1)=2 $ and $ f(-1)=6 $. Describe all functions $ f(x)=ax^2+bx+c $ such that $ f(1)=2 $.    Plugging in $ x=1 $ and $ x=-1 $ gives $ $ a + b + c = 2 a - b + c = 6 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ a + b + c = 2 -2b = 4 $ $ so the set of functions is $ {f(x)=(4-c)x^2-2x+c such that c in ℝ} $. Putting in $ x=1 $ gives $ $ a + b + c = 2 $ $ so the set of functions is $ {f(x)=(2-b-c)x^2+bx+c such that b,c in ℝ} $.   Show that any set of five points from the plane $ ℝ^2 $ lie on a common conic section, that is, they all satisfy some equation of the form $ ax^2+by^2+cxy+dx+ey+f=0 $ where some of $ a,...,f $ are nonzero.  On plugging in the five pairs $(x,y)$ we get a system with the five equations and six unknowns $a$, ..., $f$. Because there are more unknowns than equations, if no inconsistency exists among the equations then there are infinitely many solutions (at least one variable will end up free).  But no inconsistency can exist because $a=0$, ..., $f=0$ is a solution (we are only using this zero solution to show that the system is consistent- the prior paragraph shows that there are nonzero solutions).   Make up a four equations/four unknowns system having  a one-parameter solution set; a two-parameter solution set; a three-parameter solution set.    Here is one- the fourth equation is redundant but still OK. $ $ x + y - z + w = 0 y - z = 0 2z + 2w = 0 z + w = 0 $ $ Here is one. $ $ x + y - z + w = 0 w = 0 w = 0 w = 0 $ $ This is one. $ $ x + y - z + w = 0 x + y - z + w = 0 x + y - z + w = 0 x + y - z + w = 0 $ $     This puzzle is from a Russian web-site and there are many solutions to it, but mine uses linear algebra and is very naive. There's a planet inhabited by arbuzoids (watermeloners, to translate from Russian). Those creatures are found in three colors: red, green and blue. There are $13$~red arbuzoids, $15$~blue ones, and $17$~green. When two differently colored arbuzoids meet, they both change to the third color.  The question is, can it ever happen that all of them assume the same color?   My solution was to define the numbers of arbuzoids as $3$-dimensional vectors, and express all possible elementary transitions as such vectors, too:   R: $13$ G: $15$ B: $17$   Operations: $[-1 -1 2]$, $[-1 2 -1]$, and $[2 -1 -1]$  Now, it is enough to check whether the solution to one of the following systems of linear equations exists: $ [13 15 17] +x[-1 -1 2] +y[-1 2 -1] +[2 -1 -1] =[0 0 45]  (or $[0 45 0]$ or $[45 0 0]$) $ Solving $ ([ -1 -1 2 -13 -1 2 -1 -15 2 -1 -1 28 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ -1 -1 2 -13 0 3 -3 -2 0 0 0 0 ]) $ gives $y+2/3=z$ so if the number of transformations $z$ is an integer then $y$ is not. The other two systems give similar conclusions so there is no solution.     Solve the system of equations. $ $ ax + y = a^2 x + ay = 1 $ $ For what values of $a$ does the system fail to have solutions, and for what values of $a$ are there infinitely many solutions? Answer the above question for the system. $ $ ax + y = a^3 x + ay = 1 $ $     Formal solution of the system yields $ x=(a^3-1/a^2-1)  y=(-a^2+a/a^2-1). $ If $a+1 ≠ 0$ and $a-1 ≠ 0$, then the system has the single solution $ x=(a^2+a+1/a+1)  y=(-a/a+1). $ If $a=-1$, or if $a=+1$, then the formulas are meaningless; in the first instance we arrive at the system $ \{ $ -x + y = 1 x - y = 1 $. $ which is a contradictory system. In the second instance we have $ \{ $ x + y = 1 x + y = 1 $. $ which has an infinite number of solutions (for example, for $x$ arbitrary, $y=1-x$). Solution of the system yields $ x=(a^4-1/a^2-1)  y=(-a^3+a/a^2-1). $ Here, is $a^2-1 ≠ 0$, the system has the single solution $x=a^2+1$, $y=-a$. For $a=-1$ and $a=1$, we obtain the systems $ \{ $ -x + y = -1 x - y = 1 $.  \{ $ x + y = 1 x + y = 1 $. $ both of which have an infinite number of solutions.     In air a gold-sur-faced sphere weighs $ 7588 $ grams. It is known that it may contain one or more of the metals aluminum, copper, silver, or lead. When weighed successively under standard conditions in water, benzene, alcohol, and glycerin its respective weights are $ 6588 $, $ 6688 $, $ 6778 $, and $ 6328 $ grams. How much, if any, of the forenamed metals does it contain if the specific gravities of the designated substances are taken to be as follows?   Aluminum $ 2.7 $ [3em]{} Alcohol 0.81 Copper $ 8.9 $ Benzene $ 0.90 $ Gold $ 19.3 $ Glycerin $ 1.26 $ Lead $ 11.3 $ Water $ 1.00 $ Silver $ 10.8 $     Let $ u $, $ v $, $ x $, $ y $, $ z $ be the volumes in $ {cm}^3 $ of Al, Cu, Pb, Ag, and Au, respectively, contained in the sphere, which we assume to be not hollow. Since the loss of weight in water (specific gravity $ 1.00 $) is $ 1000 $ grams, the volume of the sphere is $ 1000 cm^3 $. Then the data, some of which is superfluous, though consistent, leads to only $ 2 $ independent equations, one relating volumes and the other, weights. $ $ u + v + x + y + z = 1000 2.7u + 8.9v + 11.3x + 10.5y + 19.3z = 7558 $ $ Clearly the sphere must contain some aluminum to bring its mean specific gravity below the specific gravities of all the other metals. There is no unique result to this part of the problem, for the amounts of three metals may be chosen arbitrarily, provided that the choices will not result in negative amounts of any metal.  If the ball contains only aluminum and gold, there are $ 294.5 cm^3 $ of gold and $ 705.5 cm^3 $ of aluminum. Another possibility is $ 124.7 cm^3 $ each of Cu, Au, Pb, and Ag and $ 501.2 cm^3 $ of Al.                            subsection{texorpdfstring($General=Particular+Homogeneous$){General=Particular+Homogeneous}} In the prior subsection the descriptions of solution sets all fit a pattern. They have a vector that is a particular solution of the system added to an unrestricted combination of some other vectors. The solution set from illustrates. $ { underbracket[.7pt]{ [0 4 0 0 0]}_{{rule{0pt{2ex}particular solution}}}+ underbracket[.7pt]{w[1 -1 3 1 0]+ u[1/2 -1 1/2 0 1]}_{{rule{0pt{2ex}unrestricted combination}}} such that w,u in ℝ} $ The combination is unrestricted in that $w$ and $u$ can be any real numbers- there is no condition like ``such that $2w-u=0$'' to restrict which pairs $w,u$ we can use.  That example shows an infinite solution set fitting the pattern. The other two kinds of solution sets also fit. A one-element solution set fits because it has a particular solution, and the unrestricted combination part is trivial. (That is, instead of being a combination of two vectors or of one vector, it is a combination of no vectors. By convention the sum of an empty set of vectors is the zero vector.) An empty solution set fits the pattern because there is no particular solution and thus there are no sums of that form at all.    Any linear system's solution set has the form $ {vec{{p}+c_1vec{{β}_1+·s+c_kvec{{β}_k such that c_1,...,c_k in ℝ} $ where $ vec(p) $ is any particular solution and where the number of vectors $vec(β)_1$, ..., $vec(β)_k$ equals the number of free variables that the system has after a Gaussian reduction.    The solution description has two parts, the particular solution $vec(p)$ and the unrestricted linear combination of the $vec(β)$'s. We shall prove the theorem with two corresponding lemmas.  We will focus first on the unrestricted combination. For that we consider systems that have the vector of zeroes as a particular solution so that we can shorten $vec(p)+c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_kvec(β)_k$ to $c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_kvec(β)_k$.    A linear equation is homogeneous if it has a constant of zero, so that it can be written as $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+·s+a_nx_n=0$.    For example With any linear system like $ $ 3x + 4y = 3 2x - y = 1 $ $ we associate a system of homogeneous equations by setting the right side to zeros. $ $ 3x + 4y = 0 2x - y = 0 $ $ Compare the reduction of the original system $ $ 3x + 4y = 3 2x - y = 1 $ for step $-(2/3)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 3x + 4y = 3 -(11/3)y = -1 $ $ with the reduction of the associated homogeneous system. $ $ 3x + 4y = 0 2x - y = 0 $ for step $-(2/3)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 3x + 4y = 0 -(11/3)y = 0 $ $ Obviously the two reductions go in the same way. We can study how to reduce a linear systems by instead studying how to reduce the associated homogeneous system.   Studying the associated homogeneous system has a great advantage over studying the original system. Nonhomogeneous systems can be inconsistent. But a homogeneous system must be consistent since there is always at least one solution, the zero vector.   For example Some homogeneous systems have the zero vector as their only solution. $ $ 3x + 2y + z = 0 6x + 4y = 0 y + z = 0 $ for step $-2ρ_1 +ρ_2$ $ 3x + 2y + z = 0 -2z = 0 y + z = 0 $ for step $ρ_2 ↔ρ_3$ $ 3x + 2y + z = 0 y + z = 0 -2z = 0 $ $   For example Some homogeneous systems have many solutions. One is the Chemistry problem from the first page of the first subsection. $ $ 7x - 7z = 0 8x + y - 5z - 2w = 0 y - 3z = 0 3y - 6z - w = 0 $ for step $-(8/7)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 7x - 7z = 0 y + 3z - 2w = 0 y - 3z = 0 3y - 6z - w = 0 $ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ 7x - 7z = 0 y + 3z - 2w = 0 -6z + 2w = 0 -15z + 5w = 0 $ for step $-(5/2)ρ_3+ρ_4$ $ 7x - 7z = 0 y + 3z - 2w = 0 -6z + 2w = 0 0 = 0 $ $ The solution set $ {[1/3 1 1/3 1]w such that w in ℝ} $ has many vectors besides the zero vector (if we interpret $ w $ as a number of molecules then solutions make sense only when $ w $ is a nonnegative multiple of $3$).         For any homogeneous linear system there exist vectors $vec(β)_1$, ..., $vec(β)_k$ such that the solution set of the system is $ {c_1vec{{β}_1+·s+c_kvec{{β}_k such that c_1,...,c_k in ℝ} $ where $k$ is the number of free variables in an echelon form version of the system.    We will make two points before the proof. The first is that the basic idea of the proof is straightforward.  Consider this system of homogeneous equations in echelon form. $ $ x + y + 2z + u + v = 0 y + z + u - v = 0 u + v = 0 $ $ Start with the bottom equation. Express its leading variable in terms of the free variables with $u=-v$. For the next row up, substitute for the leading variable~$u$ of the row below $y+z+(-v)-v=0$ and solve for this row's leading variable $y=-z+2v$. Iterate: on the next row up, substitute expressions found in lower rows $x+(-z+2v)+2z+(-v)+v=0$ and solve for the leading variable $x=-z-2v$. To finish, write the solution in vector notation $ [x y z u v] =[-1 -1 1 0 0]z +[-2 2 0 -1 1]v for $z,v in ℝ$ $ and recognize that the $vec(β)_1$ and $vec(β)_2$ of the lemma are the vectors associated with the free variables $z$ and~$v$.   The prior paragraph is an example, not a proof. But it does suggest the second point about the proof, its approach. The example moves row-by-row up the system, using the equations from lower rows to do the next row. This points to doing the proof by mathematical induction.    Induction is an important and non-obvious proof technique that we shall use a number of times in this book. We will do proofs by induction in two steps, a base step and an inductive step. In the base step we verify that the statement is true for some first instance, here that for the bottom equation we can write the leading variable in terms of free variables. In the inductive step we must establish an implication, that if the statement is true for all prior cases then it follows for the present case also. Here we will establish that if for the bottom-most~$ t $ rows we can express the leading variables in terms of the free variables, then for the $ t+1 $-th row from the bottom we can also express the leading variable in terms of those that are free.  Those two steps together prove the statement for all the rows because by the base step it is true for the bottom equation, and by the inductive step the fact that it is true for the bottom equation shows that it is true for the next one up. Then another application of the inductive step implies that it is true for the third equation up, etc.    Apply Gauss's Method to get to echelon form. There may be some $ 0=0 $ equations; we ignore these (if the system consists only of $ 0=0 $~equations then the lemma is trivially true because there are no leading variables). But because the system is homogeneous there are no contradictory equations.  We will use induction to verify that each leading variable can be expressed in terms of free variables. That will finish the proof because we can use the free variables as parameters and the $vec(β)$'s are the vectors of coefficients of those free variables.    For the base step consider the bottom-most equation $ a_{m,l_m}x_{l_m}+a_{m,l_m+1}x_{l_m+1}+·s+a_{m,n}x_n=0  $ where $ a_{m,l_m} ≠ 0 $.  (The `$l$' means ``leading'' so that $x_{l_m}$ is the leading variable in row~$m$.)  This is the bottom row so any variables after the leading one must be free. Move these to the right hand side and divide by $a_{m,l_m}$ $ x_{l_m} =(-a_{m,l_m+1}/a_{m,l_m})x_{l_m+1}+·s+(-a_{m,n}/a_{m,l_m})x_n $ to express the leading variable in terms of free variables.  (There is a tricky technical point here:~if in the bottom equation~($*$) there are no variables to the right of~$x_{l_m}$ then $ x_{l_m}=0 $. This satisfies the statement we are verifying because, as alluded to at the start of this subsection, it has $ x_{l_m} $ written as a sum of a number of the free variables, namely as the sum of zero many, under the convention that a trivial sum totals to~$0$.)   For the inductive step assume that the statement holds for the bottom-most $t$~rows, with $0≤ t<m-1$. That is, assume that for the $ m $-th equation, and the $ (m-1) $-th equation, etc., up to and including the $ (m-t) $-th~equation, we can express the leading variable in terms of free ones. We must verify that this then also holds for the next equation up, the $ (m-(t+1)) $-th equation. For that, take each variable that leads in a lower equation $ x_{l_m} $, ..., $ x_{l_{m-t}} $ and substitute its expression in terms of free variables. We only need expressions for leading variables from lower equations because the system is in echelon form, so the leading variables in equations above this one do not appear in this equation. The result has a leading term of $a_{m-(t+1),l_{m-(t+1)}}x_{l_{m-(t+1)}}$ with $ a_{m-(t+1),l_{m-(t+1)}} ≠ 0 $, and the rest of the left hand side is a linear combination of free variables. Move the free variables to the right side and divide by $ a_{m-(t+1),l_{m-(t+1)}} $ to end with this equation's leading variable $ x_{l_{m-(t+1)}} $ in terms of free variables.  We have done both the base step and the inductive step so by the principle of mathematical induction the proposition is true.    This shows, as discussed between the lemma and its proof, that we can parametrize solution sets using the free variables. We say that the set of vectors ${c_1vec{{β}_1+·s+c_kvec{{β}_k such that c_1,...,c_k in ℝ}$ is generated by or~spanned by the set $ {smash{{vec{{β}_1},...,smash{{vec{{β}_k}} $.          To finish the proof of the next lemma considers the particular solution part of the solution set's description.    For a linear system and for any particular solution $vec(p)$, the solution set equals  $ {vec{{p}+vec{{h} such that { $ vec{{h $ satisfies the associated homogeneous system} }$.         We will show mutual set inclusion, that any solution to the system is in the above set and that anything in the set is a solution of the system.   For set inclusion the first way, that if a vector solves the system then it is in the set described above, assume that $ vec(s) $ solves the system. Then $ vec(s)-vec(p) $ solves the associated homogeneous system since for each equation index $ i $, $ a_{i,1}(s_1-p_1)+·s+a_{i,n}(s_n-p_n) =(a_{i,1}s_1+·s+a_{i,n}s_n) -(a_{i,1}p_1+·s+a_{i,n}p_n) =d_i-d_i =0 $ where $ p_j $ and $ s_j $ are the $ j $-th components of $ vec(p) $ and $ vec(s) $. Express $ vec(s) $ in the required $ vec(p)+vec(h) $ form by writing $ vec(s)-vec(p) $ as $ vec(h) $.    For set inclusion the other way, take a vector of the form $vec(p)+vec(h)$, where $ vec(p) $ solves the system and $ vec(h) $ solves the associated homogeneous system and note that $vec(p)+vec(h)$ solves the given system since for any equation index~$i$, $ a_{i,1}(p_1+h_1)+·s+a_{i,n}(p_n+h_n) =(a_{i,1}p_1+·s+a_{i,n}p_n) +(a_{i,1}h_1+·s+a_{i,n}h_n) =d_i+0 =d_i $ where as earlier $ p_j $ and $ h_j $ are the $ j $-th components of $ vec(p) $ and $ vec(h) $.    The two lemmas together establish . Remember that theorem with the slogan, ``$ General = Particular + Homogeneous $''.  For example This system illustrates . $ $ x + 2y - z = 1 2x + 4y = 2 y - 3z = 0 $ $ Gauss's Method $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x + 2y - z = 1 2z = 0 y - 3z = 0 $ for step $ρ_2↔ρ_3$ $ x + 2y - z = 1 y - 3z = 0 2z = 0 $ $ shows that the general solution is a singleton set. $ {[1 0 0] } $ That single vector is obviously a particular solution. The associated homogeneous system reduces via the same row operations $ $ x + 2y - z = 0 2x + 4y = 0 y - 3z = 0 $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $ρ_2 ↔ ρ_3$ $ x + 2y - z = 0 y - 3z = 0 2z = 0 $ $ to also give a singleton set. $ {[0 0 0] } $ So, as discussed at the start of this subsection, in this single-solution case the general solution results from taking the particular solution and adding to it the unique solution of the associated homogeneous system.   For example The start of this subsection also discusses that the case where the general solution set is empty fits the $General=Particular+Homogeneous$ pattern too. This system illustrates. $ $ x + z + w = -1 2x - y + w = 3 x + y + 3z + 2w = 1 $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x + z + w = -1 -y - 2z - w = 5 y + 2z + w = 2 $ $ It has no solutions because the final two equations conflict. But the associated homogeneous system does have a solution, as do all homogeneous systems. $ $ x + z + w = 0 2x - y + w = 0 x + y + 3z + 2w = 0 $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ for step $ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ x + z + w = 0 -y - 2z - w = 0 0 = 0 $ $ In fact, the solution set is infinite. $ {[-1 -2 1 0]z+[-1 -1 0 1]w such that z,w in ℝ} $ Nonetheless, because the original system has no particular solution, its general solution set is empty- there are no vectors of the form $vec(p)+vec(h)$ because there are no $vec(p)\:$'s.     Solution sets of linear systems are either empty, have one element, or have infinitely many elements.      We've seen examples of all three happening so we need only prove that there are no other possibilities.  First observe a homogeneous system with at least one non-$ 0 $ solution $vec(v)$ has infinitely many solutions. This is because any scalar multiple of~$vec(v)$ also solves the homogeneous system and there are infinitely many vectors in the set of scalar multiples of $vec(v)$: if $s,t in ℝ$ are unequal then $svec(v) ≠ tvec(v)$, since $svec(v)-tvec(v)=(s-t)vec(v)$ is non-$0$ as any non-$0$ component of $vec(v)$, when rescaled by the non-$0$ factor $s-t$, will give a non-$0$ value.    Now apply to conclude that a solution set $ {vec{{p}+vec{{h} such that $ vec(h $ solves the associated homogeneous system)} $ is either empty (if there is no particular solution $ vec(p) $), or has one element (if there is a $ vec(p) $ and the homogeneous system has the unique solution $ 0 $), or is infinite (if there is a $ vec(p) $ and the homogeneous system has a non-$0$ solution, and thus by the prior paragraph has infinitely many solutions).    This table summarizes the factors affecting the size of a general solution.  skip     number of solutions of the [-.5ex] homogeneous system [1.7ex]  [.6ex] particular [-.55ex] solution [-.5ex] exists?   \ one infinitely many  yes unique [-.5ex] solution infinitely many [-.5ex] solutions [2ex] no no [-.5ex] solutions no [-.5ex] solutions      skip  The dimension on the top of the table is the simpler one. When we perform Gauss's Method on a linear system, ignoring the constants on the right side and so paying attention only to the coefficients on the left-hand side, we either end with every variable leading some row or else we find some variable that does not lead a row, that is, we find some variable that is free. (We formalize ``ignoring the constants on the right'' by considering the associated homogeneous system.)  A notable special case is systems having the same number of equations as unknowns. Such a system will have a solution, and that solution will be unique, if and only if it reduces to an echelon form system where every variable leads its row (since there are the same number of variables as rows), which will happen if and only if the associated homogeneous system has a unique solution.    A square matrix is nonsingular  if it is the matrix of coefficients of a homogeneous system with a unique solution. It is singular otherwise, that is, if it is the matrix of coefficients of a homogeneous system with infinitely many solutions.    For example The first of these matrices is nonsingular while the second is singular $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ])  ([ 1 2 3 6 ]) $ because the first of these homogeneous systems has a unique solution while the second has infinitely many solutions. $ $ x + 2y = 0 3x + 4y = 0 $  $ x + 2y = 0 3x + 6y = 0 $ $ We have made the distinction in the definition because a system with the same number of equations as variables behaves in one of two ways, depending on whether its matrix of coefficients is nonsingular or singular. Where the matrix of coefficients is nonsingular the system has a unique solution for any constants on the right side:~for instance, Gauss's Method shows that this system $ $ x + 2y = a 3x + 4y = b $ $ has the unique solution $x=b-2a$ and $y=(3a-b)/2$. On the other hand, where the matrix of coefficients is singular the system never has a unique solution- it has either no solutions or else has infinitely many, as with these. $ $ x + 2y = 1 3x + 6y = 2 $  $ x + 2y = 1 3x + 6y = 3 $ $   The definition uses the word `singular' because it means ``departing from general expectation.'' People often, naively, expect that systems with the same number of variables as equations will have a unique solution. Thus, we can think of the word as connoting ``troublesome,'' or at least ``not ideal.'' (That `singular' applies to those systems that never have exactly one solution is ironic, but it is the standard term.)  For example The systems from , , and each have an associated homogeneous system with a unique solution. Thus these matrices are nonsingular. $ ([ 3 4 2 -1 ])  ([ 3 2 1 6 -4 0 0 1 1 ])  ([ 1 2 -1 2 4 0 0 1 -3 ]) $ The Chemistry problem from is a homogeneous system with more than one solution so its matrix is singular. $ ([ 7 0 -7 0 8 1 -5 -2 0 1 -3 0 0 3 -6 -1 ]) $   The table above has two dimensions. We have considered the one on top:~we can tell into which column a given linear system goes solely by considering the system's left-hand side; the constants on the right-hand side play no role in this.  The table's other dimension, determining whether a particular solution exists, is tougher. Consider these two systems with the same left side but different right sides. $ $ 3x + 2y = 5 3x + 2y = 5 $  $ 3x + 2y = 5 3x + 2y = 4 $ $ The first has a solution while the second does not, so here the constants on the right side decide if the system has a solution. We could conjecture that the left side of a linear system determines the number of solutions while the right side determines if solutions exist but that guess is not correct. Compare these two, with the same right sides but different left sides. $ $ 3x + 2y = 5 4x + 2y = 4 $  $ 3x + 2y = 5 3x + 2y = 4 $ $ The first has a solution but the second does not. Thus the constants on the right side of a system don't alone determine whether a solution exists. Rather, that depends on some interaction between the left and right.  For some intuition about that interaction, consider this system with one of the coefficients left unspecified, as the variable~$c$. $ $ x + 2y + 3z = 1 x + y + z = 1 cx + 3y + 4z = 0 $ $ If $ c=2 $ then this system has no solution because the left-hand side has the third row as the sum of the first two, while the right-hand does not. If $ c ≠ 2 $ then this system has a unique solution (try it with $ c=1 $). For a system to have a solution, if one row of the matrix of coefficients on the left is a linear combination of other rows then on the right the constant from that row must be the same combination of constants from the same rows.  More intuition about the interaction comes from studying linear combinations. That will be our focus in the second chapter, after we finish the study of Gauss's Method itself in the rest of this chapter.   Solve this system. Then solve the associated homogeneous system. $ $ x + y - 2z = 0 x - y = -3 3x - y - 2z = -6 2y - 2z = 3 $ $  This reduction solves the system. $ ([ 1 1 -2 0 1 -1 0 3 3 -1 -2 -6 0 2 -2 3 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 -2 0 0 -2 2 -3 0 -4 4 -6 0 2 -2 3 ]) for step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 -2 0 0 -2 2 -3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ The solution set is this. $ {[-3/2 3/2 0] +[1 1 1]z such that z in ℝ} $ Similarly we can reduce the associated homogeneous system $ ([ 1 1 -2 0 1 -1 0 0 3 -1 -2 0 0 2 -2 0 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 -2 0 0 -2 2 0 0 -4 4 0 0 2 -2 0 ]) for step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 -2 0 0 -2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ to get its solution set. $ { [1 1 1]z such that z in ℝ} $   Solve each system. Express the solution set using vectors. Identify the particular solution and the solution set of the homogeneous system. (These systems also appear in .)  $ 3x + 6y = 18 x + 2y = 6 $ $ x + y = 1 x - y = -1 $ $ x_1 + x_3 = 4 x_1 - x_2 + 2x_3 = 5 4x_1 - x_2 + 5x_3 = 17 $ $ 2a + b - c = 2 2a + c = 3 a - b = 0 $ $ x + 2y - z = 3 2x + y + w = 4 x - y + z + w = 1 $ $ x + z + w = 4 2x + y - w = 2 3x + y + z = 7 $   For the arithmetic to these, see the answers from the prior subsection.    This is the solution set. $ S={[6 0]+[-2 1]y such that y in ℝ} $ Here are the particular solution and the solution set for the associated homogeneous system. $ [6 0] and {[-2 1]y such that y in ℝ} $ Note. There are two possible points of confusion here. First, the set $S$ given above is equal to this set $ T={[4 1]+[-2 1]y such that y in ℝ} $ because the two sets contain the same members. All of these are correct answers to, ``What is a particular solution?'' $ [6 0], [4 1], [2 2], [1 2.5] $ The second point of confusion is that the letter we use in the set doesn't matter. This set also equals $S$. $ U={[6 0]+[-2 1]u such that u in ℝ} $  This is the solution set. $ {[0 1] } $ These are a particular solution, and the solution set for the associated homogeneous system. $ [0 1]  {[0 0] } $  The solution set is infinite. $ {[4 -1 0]+[-1 1 1]x_3 such that x_3 in ℝ} $ This is a particular solution and the solution set for the associated homogeneous system. $ [4 -1 0]  {[-1 1 1]x_3 such that x_3 in ℝ} $  The solution set is a singleton. $ {[1 1 1]} $ A particular solution and the solution set for the associated homogeneous system are here. $ [1 1 1]  {[0 0 0]} $  The solution set is infinite. $ {[5/3 2/3 0 0] +[-1/3 2/3 1 0]z +[-2/3 1/3 0 1]w such that z,w in ℝ} $ A particular solution and the solution set for the associated homogeneous system are here. $ [5/3 2/3 0 0]  {[-1/3 2/3 1 0]z +[-2/3 1/3 0 1]w such that z,w in ℝ} $ This system's solution set is empty. Thus, there is no particular solution. The solution set of the associated homogeneous system is this. $ {[-1 2 1 0]z +[-1 3 0 1]w such that z,w in ℝ} $    Solve each system, giving the solution set in vector notation. Identify the particular solution and the solution of the homogeneous system.  $ 2x + y - z = 1 4x - y = 3 $ $ x - z = 1 y + 2z - w = 3 x + 2y + 3z - w = 7 $ $ x - y + z = 0 y + w = 0 3x - 2y + 3z + w = 0 -y - w = 0 $ $ a + 2b + 3c + d - e = 1 3a - b + c + d + e = 3 $   The answers from the prior subsection show the row operations.

Singular or nonsingular?  $ ([ 1 2 1 3 ]) $ $ ([ 1 2 -3 -6 ]) $ $ ([ 1 2 1 1 3 1 ]) $~(Careful!) $ ([ 1 2 1 1 1 3 3 4 7 ]) $ $ ([ 2 2 1 1 0 5 -1 1 4 ]) $    Nonsingular: $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 0 1 ]) $ ends with each row containing a leading entry. Singular: $ for step $3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 0 0 ]) $ ends with row $ 2 $ without a leading entry. Neither. A matrix must be square for either word to apply. Singular. Nonsingular.    Is the given vector in the set generated by the given set?  $ [2 3], $\ $ {[1 4], [1 5]} $ $ [-1 0 1], $\ $ {[2 1 0], [1 0 1]} $ $ [1 3 0], $\ $ {[1 0 4], [2 1 5], [3 3 0], [4 2 1]} $ $ [1 0 1 1], $\ $ {[2 1 0 1], [3 0 0 2]} $   In each case we must decide if the vector is a linear combination of the vectors in the set.  Yes. Solve $ c_1[1 4]+c_2[1 5]=[2 3] $ with $ ([ 1 1 2 4 5 3 ]) for step $-4ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 2 0 1 -5 ]) $ to conclude that there are $c_1$ and $c_2$ giving the combination. No. The reduction $ ([ 2 1 -1 1 0 0 0 1 1 ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 2 1 -1 0 -1/2 1/2 0 1 1 ]) for step $2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 2 1 -1 0 -1/2 1/2 0 0 2 ]) $ shows that $ c_1[2 1 0]+c_2[1 0 1] =[-1 0 1] $ has no solution. Yes. The reduction $ ([ 1 2 3 4 1 0 1 3 2 3 4 5 0 1 0 ]) for step $-4ρ_1+ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 3 4 1 0 1 3 2 3 0 -3 -12 -15 -4 ]) for step $3ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 3 4 1 0 1 3 2 3 0 0 -3 -9 5 ]) $ shows that there are infinitely many ways $ {[c_1 c_2 c_3 c_4]= [-10 8 -5/3 0]+ [-9 7 -3 1]c_4 such that c_4 in ℝ} $ to write a combination. $ [1 3 0]= c_1[1 0 4]+ c_2[2 1 5]+ c_3[3 3 0]+ c_4[4 2 1] $ No. Look at the third components.    Prove that any linear system with a nonsingular matrix of coefficients has a solution, and that the solution is unique.  Because the matrix of coefficients is nonsingular, Gauss's Method ends with an echelon form where each variable leads an equation. Back substitution gives a unique solution.  (Another way to see that the solution is unique is to note that with a nonsingular matrix of coefficients the associated homogeneous system has a unique solution, by definition. Since the general solution is the sum of a particular solution with each homogeneous solution, the general solution has at most one element.)   In the proof of , what happens if there are no non-$ 0=0 $ equations?  In this case the solution set is all of $ ℝ^n $ and we can express it in the required form. $ {c_1[1 0 ... 0] +c_2[0 1 ... 0] +·s +c_n[0 0 ... 1] such that c_1,...,c_n in ℝ} $   Prove that if $ vec(s) $ and $ vec(t) $ satisfy a homogeneous system then so do these vectors.  $ vec(s)+vec(t) $ $ 3vec(s) $ $ kvec(s)+mvec(t) $ for $ k,m in ℝ $  What's wrong with this argument: ``These three show that if a homogeneous system has one solution then it has many solutions- any multiple of a solution is another solution, and any sum of solutions is a solution also- so there are no homogeneous systems with exactly one solution.''?  Assume $ vec(s),vec(t) in ℝ^n $ and write them as here. $ vec(s)=[s_1 ... s_n]  vec(t)=[t_1 ... t_n] $ Also let $ a_{i,1}x_1+·s+a_{i,n}x_n=0 $ be the $ i $-th equation in the homogeneous system.  The check is easy. $ a_{i,1}(s_1+t_1)+·s+a_{i,n}(s_n+t_n) = (a_{i,1}s_1+·s+a_{i,n}s_n) +(a_{i,1}t_1+·s+a_{i,n}t_n) = 0+0 $ This is similar to the prior one. $ a_{i,1}(3s_1)+·s+a_{i,n}(3s_n) =3(a_{i,1}s_1+·s+a_{i,n}s_n) =3· 0=0 $ This one is not much harder. $ a_{i,1}(ks_1+mt_1)+·s+a_{i,n}(ks_n+mt_n) = k(a_{i,1}s_1+·s+a_{i,n}s_n) +m(a_{i,1}t_1+·s+a_{i,n}t_n) = k· 0+m· 0 $  What is wrong with that argument is that any linear combination involving only the zero vector yields the zero vector.   Prove that if a system with only rational coefficients and constants has a solution then it has at least one all-rational solution. Must it have infinitely many?  First the proof.  Gauss's Method will use only rationals (e.g., $ -(m/n)ρ_i+ρ_j $). Thus we can express the solution set using only rational numbers as the components of each vector. Now the particular solution is all rational.  There are infinitely many rational vector solutions if and only if the associated homogeneous system has infinitely many real vector solutions. That's because setting any parameters to be rationals will produce an all-rational solution.                             mph{This subsection is optional. Later material will not require the work here.}  A set can be described in many different ways. Here are two different descriptions of a single set: $ {[1 2 3]z such that z in ℝ} and {[2 4 6]w such that w in ℝ}. $ For instance, this set contains $ [5 10 15] $ (take $z=5$ and $w=5/2$) but does not contain $ [4 8 11] $ (the first component gives $z=4$ but that clashes with the third component, similarly the first component gives $w=4/5$ but the third component gives something different). Here is a third description of the same set: $ {[3 6 9]+[-1 -2 -3]y such that y in ℝ}. $  We need to decide when two descriptions are describing the same set. More pragmatically stated, how can a person tell when an answer to a homework question describes the same set as the one described in the back of the book?  Sets are equal if and only if they have the same members. A common way to show that two sets, $S_1$ and $S_2$, are equal is to show mutual inclusion: any member of $S_1$ is also in $S_2$, and any member of $S_2$ is also in $S_1$.  For example To show that $ S_1= {[1 -1 0]c+[1 1 0]d such that c,d in ℝ} $ equals $ S_2= {[4 1 0]m+[-1 -3 0]n such that m,n in ℝ} $ we show first that $S_1⊆ S_2$ and then that $S_2⊆ S_1$.  For the first half we must check that any vector from $ S_1 $ is also in $ S_2 $. We first consider two examples to use them as models for the general argument. If we make up a member of $S_1$ by trying $ c=1 $ and $ d=1 $, then to show that it is in $S_2$ we need $ m $ and $n$ such that $ [4 1 0]m +[-1 -3 0]n =[2 0 0] $ that is, this relation holds between $m$ and $n$. $ $ 4m - n = 2 1m - 3n = 0 0 = 0 $ $ Similarly, if we try $ c=2 $ and $ d=-1 $, then to show that the resulting member of $S_1$ is in $S_2$ we need $ m $ and $n$ such that such that $ [4 1 0]m +[-1 -3 0]n =[3 -3 0] $ that is, this holds. $ $ 4m - n = 3 1m - 3n = -3 0 = 0 $ $ In the general case, to show that any vector from $ S_1 $ is a member of $ S_2 $ we must show that for any $ c $ and $ d $ there are appropriate $ m $ and $ n $. We follow the pattern of the examples; fix $ [c+d -c+d 0] in S_1 $ and look for $ m $ and $ n $ such that $ [4 1 0]m +[-1 -3 0]n =[c+d -c+d 0] $ that is, this is true. $ $ 4m - n = c+d m - 3n = -c+d 0 = 0 $ $ Applying Gauss's Method $ $ 4m - n = c+d m - 3n = -c+d $ for step $-(1/4)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 4m - n = c+d -(11/4)n = -(5/4)c+(3/4)d $ $ gives $ n=(5/11)c-(3/11)d $ and $ m=(4/11)c+(2/11)d $. This shows that for any choice of $c$ and $d$ there are appropriate $m$ and $n$. We conclude any member of $S_1$ is a member of $S_2$ because it can be rewritten in this way: $ [c+d -c+d 0] =[4 1 0]((4/11)c+(2/11)d)+ [-1 -3 0]((5/11)c-(3/11)d). $  For the other inclusion, $ S_2⊆ S_1 $, we want to do the opposite. We want to show that for any choice of $m$ and $n$ there are appropriate $c$ and $d$. So fix $m$ and $n$ and solve for $ c $ and $ d $: $ $ c + d = 4m-n -c + d = m-3n $ for step $ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ c + d = 4m-n 2d = 5m-4n $ $ shows that $ d=(5/2)m-2n $ and $ c=(3/2)m+n $. Thus any vector from $ S_2 $ $ [4 1 0]m+[-1 -3 0]n $ is also of the right form for $ S_1 $ $ [1 -1 0]((3/2)m+n) +[1 1 0]((5/2)m-2n). $   For example Of course, sometimes sets are not equal. The method of the prior example will help us see the relationship between the two sets. These $ P= {[x+y 2x y] such that x,y in ℝ} and R= {[m+p n p] such that m,n,p in ℝ} $ are not equal sets. While $P$ is a subset of $R$, it is a proper subset of $R$ because $R$ is not a subset of $P$.  To see that, observe first that given a vector from $ P $ we can express it in the form for $ R $- if we fix $x$ and $y$, we can solve for appropriate $m$, $n$, and $p$: $ $ m + p = x+y n = 2x p = y $ $ shows that we can express any $ vec(v)= [1 2 0]x+ [1 0 1]y $ as a member of $ R $ with $ m=x $, $ n=2x $, and $ p=y $: $ vec(v)= [1 0 0]x+ [0 1 0]2x+ [1 0 1]y. $ Thus $ P⊆ R $.  But, for the other direction, the reduction resulting from fixing $m$, $n$, and $p$ and looking for $x$ and $y$ $ $ x + y = m+p 2x = n y = p $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x + y = m+p -2y = -2m+n-2p y = p $ for step $(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ x + y = m+p -2y = -2m+n-2p 0 = m+(1/2)n $ $ shows that the only vectors $ [m+p n p] in R $ representable in the form $ [x+y 2x y] $ are those where $ 0=m+(1/2)n $. For instance, $ [0 1 0] $ is in $ R $ but not in $ P $.     Decide if the vector is a member of the set.  $[2 3]$, ${[1 2]k such that k in ℝ}$ $[-3 3]$, ${[1 -1]k such that k in ℝ}$ $[-3 3 4]$, ${[1 -1 2]k such that k in ℝ}$ $[-3 3 4]$, ${[1 -1 2]k+[0 0 2]m such that k,m in ℝ}$ $[1 4 14]$, ${[2 2 5]k+[-1 0 2]m such that k,m in ℝ}$ $[1 4 6]$, ${[2 2 5]k+[-1 0 2]m such that k,m in ℝ}$    No. Yes. No. Yes. Yes; use Gauss's Method to get $k=4$ and $m=-3$. No; use Gauss's Method to conclude that there is no solution.    Produce two descriptions of this set that are different than this one. $ {[2 -5]k such that k in ℝ} $  One easy thing to do is to double and triple the vector: $ {[4 -10]k such that k in ℝ} and {[6 -55]k such that k in ℝ}. $   Show that the three descriptions given at the start of this subsection all describe the same set.  Instead of showing all three equalities, we can show that the first equals the second, and that the second equals the third. Both equalities are easy, using the methods of this subsection.   Show that these sets are equal $ {[1 4 1 1] +[-1 0 1 0]z such that z in ℝ } and {[0 4 2 1] +[-1 0 1 0]k such that k in ℝ }, $ and that both describe the solution set of this system. $ $ x - y + z + w = -1 y - w = 3 x + z + 2w = 4 $ $  That system reduces like this: $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x - y + z + w = -1 y - w = 3 y + w = 5 $ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ x - y + z + w = -1 y - w = 3 2w = 2 $ $ showing that $ w=1 $, $ y=4 $ and $ x=2-z $.   Decide if the sets are equal.  $ {[1 2] +[0 3]t such that t in ℝ} $ and $ {[1 8] +[0 -1]s such that s in ℝ} $ $ {[1 3 1]t +[2 1 5]s such that t,s in ℝ} $ and $ {[4 7 7]m +[-4 -2 -10]n such that m,n in ℝ} $ $ {[1 2]t such that t in ℝ} $ and $ {[2 4]m +[4 8]n such that m,n in ℝ} $ $ {[1 0 2]s +[-1 1 0]t such that s,t in ℝ} $ and $ {[-1 1 1]m +[0 1 3]n such that m,n in ℝ} $ $ {[1 3 1]t +[2 4 6]s such that t,s in ℝ} $ and $ {[3 7 7]t +[1 3 1]s such that t,s in ℝ} $   For each item, we call the first set $ S_1 $ and the other $ S_2 $.  They are equal.  To see that $ S_1⊆ S_2 $, we must show that any element of the first set is in the second, that is, for any vector of the form $ vec(v)=[1 2] +[0 3]t $ there is an appropriate $ s $ such that $ vec(v)=[1 8] +[0 -1]s. $ Restated, given $ t $ we must find $ s $ so that this holds. $ $ 1 + 0s = 1+0t 8 - 1s = 2+3t $ $ That system reduces to $ $ 1 = 1 s = 6-3t $ $ That is, $ [1 2] +[0 3]t =[1 8] +[0 -1](6-3t) $ and so we can state any vector in the form for $ S_1 $ can also in the form needed for inclusion in $ S_2 $.  For $ S_2⊆ S_1 $, we look for $ t $ so that these equations hold. $ $ 1 + 0t = 1+0s 2 + 3t = 8-1s $ $ Rewrite that as $ $ 1 = 1 t = 2-(1/3)s $ $ and so $ [1 8] +[0 -1]s =[1 2] +[0 3](2-(1/3)s). $ These two are equal.  To show that $ S_1⊆ S_2 $, we check that for any $ t,s $ we can find an appropriate $ m,n $ so that these hold. $ $ 4m - 4n = 1t+2s 7m - 2n = 3t+1s 7m - 10n = 1t+5s $ $ Use Gauss's Method $ ([ 4 -4 1t+2s 7 -2 3t+1s 7 -10 1t+5s ]) for step $(-7/4)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 4 -4 1t+2s 0 5 (5/4)t-(10/4)s 0 -3 -(3/4)t+(6/4)s ]) for step $(3/5)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 4 -4 1t+2s 0 5 (5/4)t-(10/4)s 0 0 0 ]) $ to conclude that $ [1 3 1]t +[2 1 5]s =[4 7 7]((1/2)t) +[-4 -2 -10]((1/4)t-(1/2)s) $ and so $ S_1⊆ S_2 $.  For $ S_2⊆ S_1 $, solve $ $ 1t + 2s = 4m-4n 3t + 1s = 7m-2n 1t + 5s = 7m-10n $ $ with Gaussian reduction $ ([ 1 2 4m-4n 3 1 7m-2n 1 5 7m-10n ]) for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 4m-4n 0 -5 -5m+10n 0 3 3m-6n ]) for step $(3/5)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 4m-4n 0 -5 -5m+10n 0 0 0 ]) $ to get $ [4 7 7]m +[-4 -2 -10]n =[1 3 1](2m) +[2 1 5](m-2n) $ and so we can express any member of $ S_2 $ in the form needed for $ S_1 $. These sets are equal.  To prove that $ S_1⊆ S_2 $, we must be able to solve $ $ 2m + 4n = 1t 4m + 8n = 2t $ $ for $ m $ and $ n $ in terms of $ t $. Apply Gaussian reduction $ ([ 2 4 1t 4 8 2t ]) onegrstep(-2ρ_1+ρ_2) ([ 2 4 1t 0 0 0 ]) $ to conclude that any pair $ m,n $ where $ 2m+4n=t $ will do. For instance, $ [1 2]t =[2 4]((1/2)t) +[4 8](0) $ or $ [1 2]t =[2 4]((-3/2)t) +[4 8](t). $ Thus $ S_1⊆ S_2 $.  For $ S_2⊆ S_1 $, we solve $ $ 1t = 2m+4n 2t = 4m+8n $ $ with Gauss's Method $ ([ 1 2m+4n 2 4m+8n ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2m+4n 0 0 ]) $ to deduce that any vector in $ S_2 $ is also in $ S_1 $. $ [2 4]m +[4 8]n =[1 2](2m+4n) in S_1. $ Neither set is a subset of the other.  For $ S_1⊆ S_2 $ to hold we must be able to solve $ $ -1m + 0n = 1s-1t 1m + 1n = 0s+1t 1m + 3n = 2s+0t $ $ for $ m $ and $ n $ in terms of $ t $ and $ s $. Gauss's Method $ ([ -1 0 1s-1t 1 1 0s+1t 1 3 2s+0t ]) for step $ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ -1 0 1s-1t 0 1 1s+0t 0 3 3s-1t ]) for step $-3ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ -1 0 1s-1t 0 1 1s+0t 0 3 0s-1t ]) $ shows that we can only find an appropriate pair $ m,n $ when $ t=0 $. That is, $ [-1 1 0] $ has no expression of the form $ [-1 1 1]m+[0 1 3]n. $  Having shown that $ S_1 $ is not a subset of $ S_2 $, we know $ S_1 ≠ S_2 $ so, strictly speaking, we need not go further. But we shall also show that $ S_2 $ is not a subset of $ S_1 $.  For $ S_2⊆ S_1 $ to hold, we must be able to solve $ $ 1s - 1t = -1m+0n 0s + 1t = 1m+1n 2s + 0t = 1m+3n $ $ for $ s $ and $ t $. Apply row reduction $ ([ 1 -1 -1m+0n 0 1 1m+1n 2 0 1m+3n ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_3$ ([ 1 -1 -1m+0n 0 1 1m+1n 0 2 3m+3n ]) for step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 -1 -1m+0n 0 1 1m+1n 0 0 1m+1n ]) $ to deduce that the only vectors from $ S_2 $ that are also in $ S_1 $ are of the form $ [-1 1 1]m +[0 1 3](-m). $ For instance, $ [-1 1 1] $ is in $ S_2 $ but not in $ S_1 $. These sets are equal.  First we change the parameters: $ S_2={[3 7 7]m +[1 3 1]n such that m,n in ℝ}. $  Now, to show that $ S_1⊆ S_2 $, we solve $ $ 3m + 1n = 1t+2s 7m + 3n = 3t+4s 7m + 1n = 1t+6s $ $ with Gauss's Method $ ([ 3 1 1t+2s 7 3 3t+4s 7 1 1t+6s ]) for step $(-7/3)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 3 1 1t+2s 0 2/3 (2/3)t-(2/3)s 0 -4/3 (-4/3)t+(4/3)s ]) for step $2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 3 1 1t+2s 0 2/3 (2/3)t-(2/3)s 0 0 0 ]) $ to get that $ [1 3 1]t +[2 4 6]s =[3 7 7](s) +[1 3 1](t-s) $ and so $ S_1⊆ S_2 $.  The proof that $ S_2⊆ S_1 $ involves solving $ $ 1t + 2s = 3m+1n 3t + 4s = 7m+3n 1t + 6s = 7m+1n $ $ with Gaussian reduction $ ([ 1 2 3m+1n 3 4 7m+3n 1 6 7m+1n ]) for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 3m+1n 0 -2 -2m 0 4 4m ]) for step $2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 3m+1n 0 -2 -2m 0 0 0 ]) $ to conclude $ [3 7 7]m +[1 3 1]n =[1 3 1](m+n) +[2 4 6](m) $ and so any vector in $ S_2 $ is also in $ S_1 $.          textit{If you have seen the elements of vectors then this section is an optional review. However, later work will refer to this material so if this is not a review then it is not optional.}  In the first section we had to do a bit of work to show that there are only three types of solution sets- singleton, empty, and infinite. But this is easy to see geometrically in the case of systems with two equations and two unknowns. Draw each two-unknowns equation as a line in the plane, and then the two lines could have a unique intersection, be parallel, or be the same line.   [b]{1.45in} raisebox(-2pt)[8pt][0pt]{ Unique solution }  [.75ex] $$ 3x + 2y = 7 x - y = -1 $$    [b]{1.45in} raisebox(-2pt)[8pt][0pt]{ No solutions }  [.75ex] $$ 3x + 2y = 7 3x + 2y = 4 $$    [b]{1.45in} raisebox(-2pt)[8pt][0pt]{ [t] Infinitely many solutions }  [.75ex] $ 3x + 2y = 7 6x + 4y = 14 $$     These pictures aren't a short way to prove the results from the prior section, because those results apply to linear systems of any size. But they do broaden our understanding of those results.  This section develops what we need to express our results geometrically. In particular, while the two-dimensional case is familiar, to extend to systems with more than two unknowns we shall need some higher-dimensional geometry.                ``Higher-dimensional geometry'' sounds exotic. It is exotic- interesting and eye-opening. But it isn't distant or unreachable.  We begin by defining one-dimensional space to be $ ℝ $. To see that the definition is reasonable, picture a one-dimensional space    and pick a point to label $0$ and another to label~$1$.    Now, with a scale and a direction, we have a correspondence with $ ℝ $. For instance, to find the point matching $ +2.17 $, start at $ 0 $ and head in the direction of $ 1 $, and go $ 2.17 $ times as far.  The basic idea here, combining magnitude with direction, is the key to extending to higher dimensions.  An object comprised of a magnitude and a direction is a vector (we use the same word as in the prior section because we shall show below how to describe such an object with a column vector). We can draw a vector as having some length and pointing in some direction.    There is a subtlety involved in the definition of a vector as consisting of a magnitude and a direction- these    are equal, even though they start in different places They are equal because they have equal lengths and equal directions. Again: those vectors are not just alike, they are equal.  How can things that are in different places be equal? Think of a vector as representing a displacement (the word `vector' is Latin for ``carrier'' or ``traveler''). These two squares undergo displacements that are equal despite that they start in different places.    When we want to emphasize this property vectors have of not being anchored we refer to them as free vectors. Thus, these free vectors are equal, as each is a displacement of one over and two up.    More generally, vectors in the plane are the same if and only if they have the same change in first components and the same change in second components:~the vector extending from $ (a_1,a_2) $ to $ (b_1,b_2) $ equals the vector from $ (c_1,c_2) $ to $ (d_1,d_2) $ if and only if $ b_1-a_1=d_1-c_1 $ and $ b_2-a_2=d_2-c_2 $.  Saying `the vector that, were it to start at $ (a_1,a_2) $, would extend to $ (b_1,b_2) $' would be unwieldy. We instead describe that vector as $ [b_1-a_1 b_2-a_2] $ so that we represent the `one over and two up' arrows shown above in this way. $ [1 2] $ We often draw the arrow as starting at the origin, and we then say it is in the canonical position (or natural position or standard position ). When $ vec(v)=[v_1 v_2] $ is in canonical position then it extends from the origin to the endpoint $(v_1,v_2)$.  We will typically say ``the point $ [1 2]'' $ rather than ``the endpoint of the canonical position of'' that vector.    Thus, we will call each of these $ ℝ^2 $. $ {(x_1,x_2) such that x_1,x_2 in ℝ}  {[x_1 x_2] such that x_1,x_2 in ℝ} $  In the prior section we defined vectors and vector operations with an algebraic motivation; $ r·[v_1 v_2] = [rv_1 rv_2]  [v_1 v_2] + [w_1 w_2] = [v_1+w_1 v_2+w_2] $ we can now understand those operations geometrically.   For instance, if $ vec(v) $ represents a displacement then $ 3vec(v) $ represents a displacement in the same direction but three times as far and $ -1vec(v) $ represents a displacement of the same distance as $ vec(v) $ but in the opposite direction.    And, where $ vec(v) $ and $ vec(w) $ represent displacements, $ vec(v)+vec(w) $ represents those displacements combined.    The long arrow is the combined displacement in this sense: imagine that you are walking on a ship's deck. Suppose that in one minute the ship's motion gives it a displacement relative to the sea of $vec(v)$, and in the same minute your walking gives you a displacement relative to the ship's deck of $vec(w)$. Then $vec(v)+vec(w)$ is your displacement relative to the sea.  Another way to understand the vector sum is with the parallelogram rule.  Draw the parallelogram formed by the vectors $vec(v)$ and $vec(w)$. Then the sum $vec(v)+vec(w)$ extends along the diagonal to the far corner.     The above drawings show how vectors and vector operations behave in $ ℝ^2 $. We can extend to $ ℝ^3$, or to even higher-dimensional spaces where we have no pictures, with the obvious generalization:~the free vector that, if it starts at $ (a_1,...,a_n) $, ends at $ (b_1,...,b_n) $, is represented by this column. $ [b_1-a_1 ... b_n-a_n] $ Vectors are equal if they have the same representation. We aren't too careful about distinguishing between a point and the vector whose canonical representation ends at that point. $ ℝ^n= {[v_1 ... v_n] such that v_1,...,v_n in ℝ} $ And, we do addition and scalar multiplication component-wise.  Having considered points, we next turn to lines. In $ ℝ^2$, the line through $ (1,2) $ and $ (3,1) $ is comprised of (the endpoints of) the vectors in this set. $ { [1 2]+t[2 -1] such that t in ℝ} $ That description expresses this picture.    The vector that in the description is associated with the parameter~$ t $ $ [2 -1]=[3 1]-[1 2] $ is the one shown in the picture as having its whole body in the line- it is a direction vector for the line. Note that points on the line to the left of $ x=1 $ are described using negative values of $ t $.    In $ ℝ^3 $, the line through $ (1,2,1) $ and $ (2,3,2) $ is the set of (endpoints of) vectors of this form    and lines in even higher-dimensional spaces work in the same way.  In $ ℝ^3$, a line uses one parameter so that a particle on that line would be free to move back and forth in one dimension. A plane involves two parameters. For example, the plane through the points $ (1,0,5) $, $ (2,1,-3) $, and $ (-2,4,0.5) $ consists of (endpoints of) the vectors in this set. $ { [1 0 5] +t[1 1 -8] +s[-3 4 -4.5] such that t,s in ℝ } $ The column vectors associated with the parameters come from these calculations. $ [1 1 -8] = [2 1 -3] - [1 0 5]  [-3 4 -4.5] = [-2 4 0.5] - [1 0 5] $ As with the line, note that we describe some points in this plane with negative $t$'s or negative $s$'s or both.  Calculus books often describe a plane by using a single linear equation.     $   $    To translate from this to the vector description, think of this as a one-equation linear system and parametrize: $ x=2-y/2-z/2 $. $  $ Shown in grey are the vectors associated with $y$ and~$z$, offset from the origin by~$2$ units along the $x$-axis, so that their entire body lies in the plane. Thus the vector sum of the two, shown in black, has its entire body in the plane along with the rest of the parallelogram.          Generalizing, a set of the form ${vec{{p}+t_1vec{{v}_1+t_2vec{{v}_2+·s+t_kvec{{v}_k such that t_1,... ,t_k in ℝ}$ where $ vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_k in ℝ^n $ and $k≤ n$ is a $ k $-dimensional linear surface (or $ k $-flat ). For example, in $ ℝ^4$ $ {[2 π 3 -0.5] +t[1 0 0 0] such that t in ℝ} $ is a line, $ { [0 0 0 0] +t[1 1 0 -1] +s[2 0 1 0] such that t,s in ℝ} $ is a plane, and $ { [3 1 -2 0.5] +r[0 0 0 -1] +s[1 0 1 0] +t[2 0 1 0] such that r,s,t in ℝ} $ is a three-dimensional linear surface. Again, the intuition is that a line permits motion in one direction, a plane permits motion in combinations of two directions, etc. When the dimension of the linear surface is one less than the dimension of the space, that is, when in $ ℝ^n$ we have an $(n-1)$-flat, the surface is called a hyperplane.  A description of a linear surface can be misleading about the dimension. For example, this $ L={ [1 0 -1 -2] +t[1 1 0 -1] +s[2 2 0 -2] such that t,s in ℝ} $ is a degenerate plane because it is actually a line, since the vectors are multiples of each other and we can omit one. $ L={ [1 0 -1 -2] +r[1 1 0 -1] such that r in ℝ} $ We shall see in the Linear Independence section of Chapter Two what relationships among vectors causes the linear surface they generate to be degenerate.  We now can restate in geometric terms our conclusions from earlier. First, the solution set of a linear system with $ n $ unknowns is a linear surface in $ ℝ^n $. Specifically, it is a $ k $-dimensional linear surface, where $ k $ is the number of free variables in an echelon form version of the system. For instance, in the single equation case the solution set is an $n-1$-dimensional hyperplane in $ ℝ^n$ (where $n>0$). Second, the solution set of a homogeneous linear system is a linear surface passing through the origin. Finally, we can view the general solution set of any linear system as being the solution set of its associated homogeneous system offset from the origin by a vector, namely by any particular solution.       Find the canonical name for each vector.  the vector from $ (2,1) $ to $ (4,2) $ in $ ℝ^2 $ the vector from $ (3,3) $ to $ (2,5) $ in $ ℝ^2 $ the vector from $ (1,0,6) $ to $ (5,0,3) $ in $ ℝ^3 $ the vector from $ (6,8,8) $ to $ (6,8,8) $ in $ ℝ^3 $    $ [2 1] $ $ [-1 2] $ $ [4 0 -3] $ $ [0 0 0] $    Decide if the two vectors are equal.  the vector from $ (5,3) $ to $ (6,2) $ and the vector from $ (1,-2) $ to $ (1,1) $ the vector from $ (2,1,1) $ to $ (3,0,4) $ and the vector from $ (5,1,4) $ to $ (6,0,7) $    No, their canonical positions are different. $ [1 -1]  [0 3] $ Yes, their canonical positions are the same. $ [1 -1 3] $    Does $ (1,0,2,1) $ lie on the line through $ (-2,1,1,0) $ and $ (5,10,-1,4) $?  That line is this set. $ {[-2 1 1 0] +[7 9 -2 4]t such that t in ℝ } $ Note that this system $ $ -2 + 7t = 1 1 + 9t = 0 1 - 2t = 2 0 + 4t = 1 $ $ has no solution. Thus the given point is not in the line.    Describe the plane through $ (1,1,5,-1) $, $ (2,2,2,0) $, and $ (3,1,0,4) $. Is the origin in that plane?    Note that $ [2 2 2 0] -[1 1 5 -1] =[1 1 -3 1]  [3 1 0 4] -[1 1 5 -1] =[2 0 -5 5] $ and so the plane is this set. $ {[1 1 5 -1] +[1 1 -3 1]t +[2 0 -5 5]s such that t,s in ℝ} $ No; this system $ $ 1 + 1t + 2s = 0 1 + 1t = 0 5 - 3t - 5s = 0 -1 + 1t + 5s = 0 $ $ has no solution.    Describe the plane that contains this point and line. $ [2 0 3]  {[-1 0 -4] +[1 1 2]t such that t in ℝ} $  The vector $ [2 0 3] $ is not in the line. Because $ [2 0 3] -[-1 0 -4] =[3 0 7] $ we can describe that plane in this way. $ {[-1 0 -4] +m[1 1 2] +n[3 0 7] such that m,n in ℝ} $   Intersect these planes. $ {[1 1 1]t+ [0 1 3]s such that t,s in ℝ}  {[1 1 0] +[0 3 0]k+ [2 0 4]m such that k,m in ℝ} $  The points of coincidence are solutions of this system. $ $ t = 1+2m t + s = 1+3k t + 3s = 4m $ $ Gauss's Method $ ([ 1 0 0 -2 1 1 1 -3 0 1 1 3 0 -4 0 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 0 -2 1 0 1 -3 2 0 0 3 0 -2 -1 ]) for step $-3ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 0 -2 1 0 1 -3 2 0 0 0 9 -8 -1 ]) $ gives $ k=-(1/9)+(8/9)m $, so $ s=-(1/3)+(2/3)m $ and $ t=1+2m $. The intersection is this. $ {[1 1 0]+ [0 3 0](-(1/9)+(8/9)m)+ [2 0 4]m such that m in ℝ} ={[1 2/3 0] +[2 8/3 4]m such that m in ℝ} $   Intersect each pair, if possible.  $ {[1 1 2]+t[0 1 1] such that t in ℝ} $, $ {[1 3 -2]+s[0 1 2] such that s in ℝ} $ $ {[2 0 1]+t[1 1 -1] such that t in ℝ} $, $ {s[0 1 2] +w[0 4 1] such that s,w in ℝ} $    The system $ $ 1 = 1 1+t = 3+s 2+t = -2+2s $ $ gives $ s=6 $ and $ t=8 $, so this is the solution set. $ {[1 9 10] } $ This system $ $ 2+t = 0 t = s+4w 1-t = 2s+w $ $ gives $ t=-2 $, $ w=-1 $, and $ s=2 $ so their intersection is this point. $ [0 -2 3] $    When a plane does not pass through the origin, performing operations on vectors whose bodies lie in it is more complicated than when the plane passes through the origin. Consider the picture in this subsection of the plane $ {[2 0 0] +[-0.5 1 0] y +[-0.5 0 1] z such that y,z in ℝ} $ and the three vectors with endpoints $(2,0,0)$, $(1.5,1,0)$, and $(1.5,0,1)$.  Redraw the picture, including the vector in the plane that is twice as long as the one with endpoint $(1.5,1,0)$. The endpoint of your vector is not $(3,2,0)$; what is it? Redraw the picture, including the parallelogram in the plane that shows the sum of the vectors ending at $(1.5,0,1)$ and $(1.5,1,0)$. The endpoint of the sum, on the diagonal, is not $(3,1,1)$; what is it?    The vector shown    is not the result of doubling $ [2 0 0] +[-0.5 1 0]· 1 $ instead it is $ [2 0 0] +[-0.5 1 0]· 2 =[1 2 0] $ which has a parameter twice as large. The vector    is not the result of adding $ ([2 0 0] +[-0.5 1 0]· 1) + ([2 0 0] +[-0.5 0 1]· 1) $ instead it is $ [2 0 0] +[-0.5 1 0]· 1 +[-0.5 0 1]· 1 =[1 1 1] $ which adds the parameters.    Show that the line segments $ overline((a_1,a_2)(b_1,b_2)) $ and $ overline((c_1,c_2)(d_1,d_2)) $ have the same lengths and slopes if $ b_1-a_1=d_1-c_1 $ and $ b_2-a_2=d_2-c_2 $. Is that only if?  The ``if'' half is straightforward. If $ b_1-a_1=d_1-c_1 $ and $ b_2-a_2=d_2-c_2 $ then $ √{(b_1-a_1)^2+(b_2-a_2)^2} =√{(d_1-c_1)^2+(d_2-c_2)^2} $ so they have the same lengths, and the slopes are just as easy: $ (b_2-a_2/b_1-a_1) =(d_2-c_2/d_1-a_1) $ (if the denominators are $ 0 $ they both have undefined slopes).  For ``only if'', assume that the two segments have the same length and slope (the case of undefined slopes is easy; we will do the case where both segments have a slope $ m $). Also assume, without loss of generality, that $a_1<b_1$ and that $c_1<d_1$. The first segment is $ overline((a_1,a_2)(b_1,b_2))= {(x,y) such that y=mx+n_1, x in [a_1..b_1]} $ (for some intercept $n_1$) and the second segment is $ overline((c_1,c_2)(d_1,d_2))= {(x,y) such that y=mx+n_2, x in [c_1..d_1]} $ (for some $n_2$). Then the lengths of those segments are $ √{(b_1-a_1)^2+((mb_1+n_1)-(ma_1+n_1))^2} =√{(1+m^2)(b_1-a_1)^2} $ and, similarly, $ √{(1+m^2)(d_1-c_1)^2} $. Therefore, $ |b_1-a_1|=|d_1-c_1| $. Thus, as we assumed that $ a_1<b_1 $ and $ c_1<d_1 $, we have that $ b_1-a_1=d_1-c_1 $.  The other equality is similar.   How should we define $ ℝ^0$?  We shall later define it to be a set with one element- an ``origin''.    A person traveling eastward at a rate of $ 3 $ miles per hour finds that the wind appears to blow directly from the north. On doubling his speed it appears to come from the north east. What was the wind's velocity?   The vector triangle is as follows, so $ vec(w)=3√{2} $ from the north west.  setlength(\unitlength){4pt} (0,0) put(0,10){ } put(0,10){ } put(3.8,5){(0,0)[r]{ $ vec(w) $} } put(10,0){ } put(10,0){ }    checked Euclid describes a plane as ``a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself''. Commentators such as Heron have interpreted this to mean, ``(A plane surface is) such that, if a straight line pass through two points on it, the line coincides wholly with it at every spot, all ways''. (Translations from , pp. 171-172.) Do planes, as described in this section, have that property? Does this description adequately define planes?  Euclid no doubt is picturing a plane inside of $ ℝ^3 $. Observe, however, that both $ ℝ^1 $ and $ ℝ^2 $ also satisfy that definition.                    We've translated the first section's results about solution sets into geometric terms, to better understand those sets. But we must be careful not to be misled by our own terms- labeling subsets of $ ℝ^k $ of the forms $ {vec{{p}+tvec{{v} such that t in ℝ} $ and $ {vec{{p}+tvec{{v}+svec{{w} such that t,s in ℝ} $ as `lines' and `planes' doesn't make them act like the lines and planes of our past experience. Rather, we must ensure that the names suit the sets. While we can't prove that the sets satisfy our intuition- we can't prove anything about intuition- in this subsection we'll observe that a result familiar from $ ℝ^2 $ and $ ℝ^3 $, when generalized to arbitrary $ ℝ^n $, supports the idea that a line is straight and a plane is flat. Specifically, we'll see how to do Euclidean geometry in a `plane' by giving a definition of the angle between two $ ℝ^n$ vectors, in the plane that they generate.    The length  of a vector $ vec(v) in ℝ^n $ is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. $ |vec(v)|=√{v_1^2+·s+v_n^2} $     This is a natural generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem. A classic motivating discussion is in .   For any nonzero $vec(v)$, the vector $vec(v)/|vec(v)|$ has length one. We say that the second normalizes $vec(v)$ to length one.  We can use that to get a formula for the angle between two vectors. Consider two vectors in $ ℝ^3 $ where neither is a multiple of the other    (the special case of multiples will turn out below not to be an exception). They determine a two-dimensional plane- for instance, put them in canonical position and take the plane formed by the origin and the endpoints. In that plane consider the triangle with sides $ vec(u) $, $ vec(v) $, and $ vec(u)-vec(v) $.    Apply the Law of Cosines: $|vec(u)-vec(v)|^2 = |vec(u)|^2+|vec(v)|^2- 2|vec(u)||vec(v)|cos(θ)$ where $ θ $ is the angle between the vectors. The left side gives $ (u_1-v_1)^2+(u_2-v_2)^2+(u_3-v_3)^2 =(u_1^2-2u_1v_1+v_1^2)+(u_2^2-2u_2v_2+v_2^2)+(u_3^2-2u_3v_3+v_3^2) $ while the right side gives this. $ (u_1^2+u_2^2+u_3^2)+(v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2)- 2|vec(u)||vec(v)|cos(θ) $ Canceling squares $u_1^2$, ..., $v_3^2$ and dividing by $2$ gives a formula for the angle. $ θ = arccos(frac(u_1v_1+u_2v_2+u_3v_3){ |vec(u)||vec(v)| }) $  In higher dimensions we cannot draw pictures as above but we can instead make the argument analytically. First, the form of the numerator is clear; it comes from the middle terms of $ (u_i-v_i)^2 $.    The dot product (or inner product or scalar product ) of two $ n $-component real vectors is the linear combination of their components. $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)=Linear combination of u{v} $   Note that the dot product of two vectors is a real number, not a vector, and that the dot product is only defined if the two vectors have the same number of components. Note also that dot product is related to length: $ vec(u)dot product of vec(u)=u_1u_1+·s+u_nu_n=|vec(u)|^2 $.   Some authors require that the first vector be a row vector and that the second vector be a column vector. We shall not be that strict and will allow the dot product operation between two column vectors.   Still reasoning analytically but guided by the pictures, we use the next theorem to argue that the triangle formed by the line segments making the bodies of $ vec(u) $, $ vec(v) $, and $ vec(u)+vec(v) $ in $ ℝ^n $ lies in the planar subset of $ ℝ^n $ generated by $ vec(u) $ and $ vec(v) $ (see the figure below).  [Triangle Inequality]   For any $ vec(u),vec(v) in ℝ^n $, $ |vec(u)+vec(v)|≤|vec(u)|+|vec(v)| $ with equality if and only if one of the vectors is a nonnegative scalar multiple of the other one.    This is the source of the familiar saying, ``The shortest distance between two points is in a straight line.''      (We'll use some algebraic properties of dot product that we have not yet checked, for instance that $ vec(u)dot product of (vec(a)+vec(b)) =vec(u)dot product of vec(a)+vec(u)dot product of vec(b) $ and that $vec(u)dot product of vec(v)=vec(v)dot product of vec(u)$. See .)  Since all the numbers are positive, the inequality holds if and only if its square holds. $ |vec(u)+vec(v)|^2 ≤(|vec(u)|+|vec(v)|)^2 (vec(u)+vec(v))dot product of (vec(u)+vec(v)) ≤|vec(u)|^2+2|vec(u)||vec(v)| +|vec(v)|^2 vec(u)dot product of vec(u)+vec(u)dot product of vec(v) +vec(v)dot product of vec(u)+vec(v)dot product of vec(v) ≤vec(u)dot product of vec(u)+2|vec(u)||vec(v)| +vec(v)dot product of vec(v) 2vec(u)dot product of vec(v) ≤ 2|vec(u)||vec(v)| $   That, in turn, holds if and only if the relationship obtained by multiplying both sides by the nonnegative numbers $ |vec(u)| $ and $ |vec(v)| $ $ 2(|vec(v)|vec(u))dot product of (|vec(u)|vec(v)) ≤ 2|vec(u)|^2|vec(v)|^2 $ and rewriting $ 0 ≤ |vec(u)|^2|vec(v)|^2 -2(|vec(v)|vec(u))dot product of (|vec(u)|vec(v)) +|vec(u)|^2|vec(v)|^2 $ is true. But factoring shows that it is true $ 0≤ (|vec(u)|vec(v)-|vec(v)|vec(u))dot product of (|vec(u)|vec(v)-|vec(v)|vec(u)) $ since it only says that the square of the length of the vector $ |vec(u)|vec(v)-|vec(v)|vec(u) $ is not negative.   As for equality, it holds when, and only when, $ |vec(u)|vec(v)-|vec(v)|vec(u) $ is $ 0 $. The check that $ |vec(u)|vec(v)=|vec(v)|vec(u) $ if and only if one vector is a nonnegative real scalar multiple of the other is easy.    This result supports the intuition that even in higher-dimensional spaces, lines are straight and planes are flat. We can easily check from the definition that linear surfaces have the property that for any two points in that surface, the line segment between them is contained in that surface. But if the linear surface were not flat then that would allow for a shortcut.    Because the Triangle Inequality says that in any $ ℝ^n$ the shortest cut between two endpoints is simply the line segment connecting them, linear surfaces have no bends.  Back to the definition of angle measure. The heart of the Triangle Inequality's proof is the $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)≤ |vec(u)||vec(v)| $ line. We might wonder if some pairs of vectors satisfy the inequality in this way:~while $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v) $ is a large number, with absolute value bigger than the right-hand side, it is a negative large number. The next result says that does not happen.  [Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality]    For any $ vec(u),vec(v) in ℝ^n $, $ |vec(u)dot product of vec(v)| ≤ |vec(u)||vec(v)| $ with equality if and only if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.      The Triangle Inequality's proof shows that $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)≤ |vec(u)||vec(v)| $ so if $vec(u)dot product of vec(v)$ is positive or zero then we are done. If $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v) $ is negative then this holds. $ |vec(u)dot product of vec(v)| =-(vec(u)dot product of vec(v)) =(-vec(u))dot product of vec(v) ≤ |-vec(u)||vec(v)| =|vec(u)||vec(v)| $ The equality condition is .    The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality assures us that the next definition makes sense because the fraction has absolute value less than or equal to one.    The angle between two nonzero vectors $ vec(u),vec(v) in ℝ^n $ is $ θ = arccos(frac{vec(u)dot product of vec(v)}{ |vec(u)||vec(v)| }) $ (if either is the zero vector, we take the angle to be right).      Vectors from $ ℝ^n $ are orthogonal, that is, perpendicular, if and only if their dot product is zero. They are parallel if and only if their dot product equals the product of their lengths.    For example These vectors are orthogonal.  {0.6in}    $[1 -1]dot product of [1 1]=0$  We've drawn the arrows away from canonical position but nevertheless the vectors are orthogonal.   For example The $ ℝ^3 $ angle formula given at the start of this subsection is a special case of the definition. Between these two    the angle is $ arccos(frac((1)(0)+(1)(3)+(0)(2)){√{1^2+1^2+0^2}√{0^2+3^2+2^2}}) =arccos(frac(3){√{2}√{13}}) $ approximately $0.94~radians$. Notice that these vectors are not orthogonal. Although the $ yz $-plane may appear to be perpendicular to the $ xy $-plane, in fact the two planes are that way only in the weak sense that there are vectors in each orthogonal to all vectors in the other. Not every vector in each is orthogonal to all vectors in the other.         Find the length of each vector.  $ [3 1] $ $ [-1 2] $ $ [4 1 1] $ $ [0 0 0] $ $ [1 -1 1 0] $    $ √{3^2+1^2}=√{10} $ $ √{5} $ $ √{18} $ $ 0 $ $ √{3} $    Find the angle between each two, if it is defined.   $ [1 2], [1 4] $  $ [1 2 0], [0 4 1] $  $ [1 2], [1 4 -1] $    $ arccos(9/√{85})≈ 0.22 radians $ $ arccos(8/√{85})≈ 0.52 radians $ Not defined.     During maneuvers preceding the Battle of Jutland, the British battle cruiser Lion moved as follows (in nautical miles):~$ 1.2 $ miles north, $ 6.1 $ miles $ 38 $ degrees east of south, $ 4.0 $ miles at $ 89 $ degrees east of north, and $ 6.5 $ miles at $ 31 $ degrees east of north. Find the distance between starting and ending positions. (Ignore the earth's curvature.)  We express each displacement as a vector, rounded to one decimal place because that's the accuracy of the problem's statement, and add to find the total displacement (ignoring the curvature of the earth). $ [0.0 1.2] +[3.8 -4.8] +[4.0 0.1] +[3.3 5.6] =[11.1 2.1] $ The distance is $ √{11.1^2+2.1^2}≈ 11.3 $.   Find $ k $ so that these two vectors are perpendicular. $ [k 1]  [4 3] $  Solve $ (k)(4)+(1)(3)=0 $ to get $ k=-3/4 $.   Describe the set of vectors in $ ℝ^3 $ orthogonal to the one with entires $1$, $3$, and~$-1$.     We could describe the set $ {[x y z] such that 1x+3y-1z=0} $ with parameters in this way. $ {[-3 1 0]y+[1 0 1]z such that y,z in ℝ} $    Find the angle between the diagonal of the unit square in $ ℝ^2 $ and one of the axes. Find the angle between the diagonal of the unit cube in $ ℝ^3 $ and one of the axes. Find the angle between the diagonal of the unit cube in $ ℝ^n $ and one of the axes. What is the limit, as $ n $ goes to $ infty $, of the angle between the diagonal of the unit cube in $ ℝ^n $ and one of the axes?    We can use the $ x $-axis. $ arccos(frac((1)(1)+(0)(1)){√{1}√{2}}) ≈ 0.79~radians $ Again, use the $ x $-axis. $ arccos(frac((1)(1)+(0)(1)+(0)(1)){√{1}√{3}}) ≈ 0.96~radians $ The $ x $-axis worked before and it will work again. $ arccos(frac((1)(1)+·s+(0)(1)){√{1}√{n}}) =arccos(frac(1){√{n}}) $ Using the formula from the prior item, $lim(_){nto(infty)} arccos(1/√{n}) =π/2 radians$.    Is any vector perpendicular to itself?  Clearly $ u_1u_1+·s+u_nu_n $ is zero if and only if each $ u_i $ is zero. So only $ 0 in ℝ^n $ is perpendicular to itself.   Describe the algebraic properties of dot product.  Is it right-distributive over addition: $ (vec(u)+vec(v))dot product of vec(w) = vec(u)dot product of vec(w)+vec(v)dot product of vec(w) $? Is it left-distributive (over addition)? Does it commute? Associate? How does it interact with scalar multiplication?  As always, you must back any assertion with either a proof or an example.  In each item below, assume that the vectors $ vec(u),vec(v),vec(w) in ℝ^n $ have components $ u_1,...,u_n,v_1,...,w_n $.  Dot product is right-distributive. $ (vec(u)+vec(v))dot product of vec(w) =[[u_1 ... u_n] +[v_1 ... v_n]]dot product of [w_1 ... w_n] = [u_1+v_1 ... u_n+v_n]dot product of [w_1 ... w_n] = (u_1+v_1)w_1+·s+(u_n+v_n)w_n = (u_1w_1+·s+u_nw_n)+(v_1w_1+·s+v_nw_n) = vec(u)dot product of vec(w)+vec(v)dot product of vec(w) $ Dot product is also left distributive: $vec(w)dot product of (vec(u)+vec(v))= vec(w)dot product of vec(u)+vec(w)dot product of vec(v)$. The proof is just like the prior one. Dot product commutes. $ [u_1 ... u_n]dot product of [v_1 ... v_n] =u_1v_1+·s+u_nv_n =v_1u_1+·s+v_nu_n =[v_1 ... v_n]dot product of [u_1 ... u_n] $ Because $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v) $ is a scalar, not a vector, the expression $ (vec(u)dot product of vec(v))dot product of vec(w) $ makes no sense; the dot product of a scalar and a vector is not defined. This is a vague question so it has many answers. Some are (1)~$ k(vec(u)dot product of vec(v))=(kvec(u))dot product of vec(v) $ and $ k(vec(u)dot product of vec(v))=vec(u)dot product of (kvec(v)) $, (2)~$ k(vec(u)dot product of vec(v)) ≠ (kvec(u))dot product of (kvec(v)) $ (in general; an example is easy to produce), and (3)~$ |kvec(v)|=lvert(k)rvert|vec(v)| $ (the connection between length and dot product is that the square of the length is the dot product of a vector with itself).    Verify the equality condition in , the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality.  Show that if $ vec(u) $ is a negative scalar multiple of $ vec(v) $ then $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v) $ and $ vec(v)dot product of vec(u) $ are less than or equal to zero. Show that $ |vec(u)dot product of vec(v)|= |vec(u)||vec(v)| $ if and only if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.    Verifying that $ (kvec(x))dot product of vec(y)=k(vec(x)dot product of vec(y)) =vec(x)dot product of (kvec(y)) $ for $ k in ℝ $ and $ vec(x),vec(y) in ℝ^n $ is easy. Now, for $ k in ℝ $ and $ vec(v),vec(w) in ℝ^n $, if $ vec(u)=kvec(v) $ then $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)=(kvec(v))dot product of vec(v) =k(vec(v)dot product of vec(v)) $, which is $ k $ times a nonnegative real.  The $ vec(v)=kvec(u) $ half is similar (actually, taking the $ k $ in this paragraph to be the reciprocal of the $ k $ above gives that we need only worry about the $ k=0 $ case). We first consider the $vec(u)dot product of vec(v)≥ 0$ case. From the Triangle Inequality we know that $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)=|vec(u)||vec(v)| $ if and only if one vector is a nonnegative scalar multiple of the other. But that's all we need because the first part of this exercise shows that, in a context where the dot product of the two vectors is positive, the two statements `one vector is a scalar multiple of the other' and `one vector is a nonnegative scalar multiple of the other', are equivalent.  We finish by considering the $vec(u)dot product of vec(v)< 0$ case. Because $0<|vec(u)dot product of vec(v)|=-(vec(u)dot product of vec(v)) =(-vec(u))dot product of vec(v)$ and $|vec(u)||vec(v)| =|-vec(u)||vec(v)|$, we have that $0<(-vec(u))dot product of vec(v)=|-vec(u)||vec(v)|$. Now the prior paragraph applies to give that one of the two vectors $-vec(u)$ and $vec(v)$ is a scalar multiple of the other. But that's equivalent to the assertion that one of the two vectors $vec(u)$ and $vec(v)$ is a scalar multiple of the other, as desired.    Suppose that $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)=vec(u)dot product of vec(w) $ and $ vec(u) ≠vec(0) $. Must $ vec(v)=vec(w) $?  No. These give an example. $ vec(u)=[1 0]  vec(v)=[1 0]  vec(w)=[1 1] $   Does any vector have length zero except a zero vector? (If ``yes'', produce an example. If ``no'', prove it.)  We prove that a vector has length zero if and only if all its components are zero.  Let $ vec(u) in ℝ^n $ have components $ u_1,...,u_n $. Recall that the square of any real number is greater than or equal to zero, with equality only when that real is zero. Thus $ |vec(u)|^2={u_1}^2+·s+{u_n}^2 $ is a sum of numbers greater than or equal to zero, and so is itself greater than or equal to zero, with equality if and only if each $ u_i $ is zero. Hence $ |vec(u)|=0 $ if and only if all the components of $ vec(u) $ are zero.   Find the midpoint of the line segment connecting $ (x_1,y_1) $ with $ (x_2,y_2) $ in $ ℝ^2 $. Generalize to $ ℝ^n $.  We can easily check that $ [( (x_1+x_2/2),(y_1+y_2/2) ]) $ is on the line connecting the two, and is equidistant from both. The generalization is obvious.   Show that if $ vec(v) ≠0 $ then $ vec(v)/|vec(v)| $ has length one. What if $ vec(v)=0 $?  Assume that $ vec(v) in ℝ^n $ has components $ v_1,...,v_n $. If $ vec(v) ≠ 0 $ then we have this. $ √{(frac(v_1){√{{v_1}^2+·s+{v_n}^2}})^2+ ...+(frac(v_n){√{{v_1}^2+·s+{v_n}^2}})^2}  $ =√{(frac{{v_1}^2}{{v_1}^2+·s+{v_n}^2})+ ...+(frac{{v_n}^2}{{v_1}^2+·s+{v_n}^2})} =1 $ $ If $ vec(v)=0 $ then $ vec(v)/|vec(v)| $ is not defined.   Show that if $ r≥ 0 $ then $ rvec(v) $ is $ r $ times as long as $ vec(v) $. What if $ r< 0 $?  For the first question, assume that $ vec(v) in ℝ^n $ and $ r≥ 0 $, take the root, and factor. $ |rvec(v)| =√{(rv_1)^2+·s+(rv_n)^2} =√{r^2({v_1}^2+·s+{v_n}^2} =r|vec(v)| $ For the second question, the result is $ r $ times as long, but it points in the opposite direction in that $ rvec(v)+(-r)vec(v)=0 $.   A vector $ vec(v) in ℝ^n $ of length one is a unit vector. Show that the dot product of two unit vectors has absolute value less than or equal to one. Can `less than' happen? Can `equal to'?  Assume that $ vec(u),vec(v) in ℝ^n $ both have length $ 1 $. Apply Cauchy-Schwarz: $|vec(u)dot product of vec(v)| ≤|vec(u)||vec(v)|=1$.  To see that `less than' can happen, in $ ℝ^2 $ take $ vec(u)=[1 0]  vec(v)=[0 1] $ and note that $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)=0 $. For `equal to', note that $ vec(u)dot product of vec(u)=1 $.   Prove that $ |vec(u)+vec(v)|^2+|vec(u)-vec(v)|^2 =2|vec(u)|^2+2|vec(v)|^2. $  Write $ vec(u)=[u_1 ... u_n]  vec(v)=[v_1 ... v_n] $ and then this computation works. $ |vec(u)+vec(v)|^2+|vec(u)-vec(v)|^2 =(u_1+v_1)^2+·s+(u_n+v_n)^2 +(u_1-v_1)^2+·s+(u_n-v_n)^2 ={u_1}^2+2u_1v_1+{v_1}^2+·s+{u_n}^2+2u_nv_n+{v_n}^2 +{u_1}^2-2u_1v_1+{v_1}^2+·s+{u_n}^2-2u_nv_n+{v_n}^2 =2({u_1}^2+·s+{u_n}^2)+2({v_1}^2+·s+{v_n}^2) =2|vec(u)|^2+2|vec(v)|^2 $   Show that if $ vec(x)dot product of vec(y)=0 $ for every $ vec(y) $ then $ vec(x)=0 $.  We will prove this demonstrating that the contrapositive statement holds:~if $ vec(x) ≠0 $ then there is a $ vec(y) $ with $ vec(x)dot product of vec(y) ≠ 0 $.  Assume that $ vec(x) in ℝ^n $. If $ vec(x) ≠0 $ then it has a nonzero component, say the $ i $-th one $ x_i $. But the vector $ vec(y) in ℝ^n $ that is all zeroes except for a one in component~$i$ gives $ vec(x)dot product of vec(y)=x_i $. (A slicker proof just considers $vec(x)dot product of vec(x)$.)   Is $ |vec(u)_1+·s+vec(u)_n| ≤ |vec(u)_1|+·s+|vec(u)_n| $? If it is true then it would generalize the Triangle Inequality.  Yes; we can prove this by induction.  Assume that the vectors are in some $ ℝ^k $. Clearly the statement applies to one vector. The Triangle Inequality is this statement applied to two vectors. For an inductive step assume the statement is true for $ n $ or fewer vectors. Then this $ |vec(u)_1+·s+vec(u)_n+vec(u)_{n+1}| ≤ |vec(u)_1+·s+vec(u)_n|+|vec(u)_{n+1}| $ follows by the Triangle Inequality for two vectors. Now the inductive hypothesis, applied to the first summand on the right, gives that as less than or equal to $ |vec(u)_1|+·s+|vec(u)_n|+|vec(u)_{n+1}| $.   What is the ratio between the sides in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality?  By definition $ frac{vec(u)dot product of vec(v)}{ |vec(u)||vec(v)|}=cos(θ) $ where $ θ $ is the angle between the vectors. Thus the ratio is $ |cos(θ)| $.   Why is the zero vector defined to be perpendicular to every vector?  So that the statement `vectors are orthogonal iff their dot product is zero' has no exceptions.   Describe the angle between two vectors in $ ℝ^1 $.  We can find the angle between $ (a) $ and $ (b) $ (for $ a,b ≠ 0 $) with $ arccos(frac(ab){√{a^2}√{b^2}}). $ If $ a $ or $ b $ is zero then the angle is $ π/2 $ radians. Otherwise, if $ a $ and $ b $ are of opposite signs then the angle is $ π $ radians, else the angle is zero~radians.   Give a simple necessary and sufficient condition to determine whether the angle between two vectors is acute, right, or obtuse.  The angle between $ vec(u) $ and $ vec(v) $ is acute if $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)> 0 $, is right if $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)=0 $, and is obtuse if $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)<0 $. That's because, in the formula for the angle, the denominator is never negative.   Generalize to $ ℝ^n $ the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem, that if $ vec(u) $ and $ vec(v) $ are perpendicular then $ |vec(u)+vec(v)|^2=|vec(u)|^2+|vec(v)|^2 $.  Suppose that $ vec(u),vec(v) in ℝ^n $. If $ vec(u) $ and $ vec(v) $ are perpendicular then $ |vec(u)+vec(v)|^2 =(vec(u)+vec(v))dot product of (vec(u)+vec(v)) =vec(u)dot product of vec(u)+2vec(u)dot product of vec(v) +vec(v)dot product of vec(v) =vec(u)dot product of vec(u)+vec(v)dot product of vec(v) =|vec(u)|^2+|vec(v)|^2 $ (the third equality holds because $ vec(u)dot product of vec(v)=0 $).   Show that $ |vec(u)|=|vec(v)| $ if and only if $ vec(u)+vec(v) $ and $ vec(u)-vec(v) $ are perpendicular. Give an example in $ ℝ^2 $.  Where $ vec(u),vec(v) in ℝ^n $, the vectors $ vec(u)+vec(v) $ and $ vec(u)-vec(v) $ are perpendicular if and only if $0=(vec(u)+vec(v))dot product of (vec(u)-vec(v)) =vec(u)dot product of vec(u)-vec(v)dot product of vec(v)$, which shows that those two are perpendicular if and only if $ vec(u)dot product of vec(u)=vec(v)dot product of vec(v) $. That holds if and only if $ |vec(u)|=|vec(v)| $.   Show that if a vector is perpendicular to each of two others then it is perpendicular to each vector in the plane they generate. (Remark. They could generate a degenerate plane- a line or a point- but the statement remains true.)  Suppose $ vec(u) in ℝ^n $ is perpendicular to both $ vec(v) in ℝ^n $ and $ vec(w) in ℝ^n $. Then, for any $ k,m in ℝ $ we have this. $ vec(u)dot product of (kvec(v)+mvec(w)) =k(vec(u)dot product of vec(v))+m(vec(u)dot product of vec(w)) =k(0)+m(0)=0 $   Prove that, where $ vec(u),vec(v) in ℝ^n $ are nonzero vectors, the vector $ frac{vec(u)}{|vec(u)| }+frac{vec(v)}{|vec(v)| } $ bisects the angle between them. Illustrate in $ ℝ^2 $.  We will show something more general:~if $ |vec(z)_1|=|vec(z)_2| $ for $ vec(z)_1,vec(z)_2 in ℝ^n $, then $ vec(z)_1+vec(z)_2 $ bisects the angle between $ vec(z)_1 $ and $ vec(z)_2 $  setlength(\unitlength){4pt} (0,0) put(0,0){(0,0) thicklines put(0,0){ } put(0,0){ } put(0,0){ } thinlines put(8,4){ } put(4,8){ } } put(18.5,7){(0,0){ gives} } put(25,0){(0,0) thinlines put(0,0){ } put(0,0){ } put(0,0){ } put(8,4){ } put(4,8){ }    {$ prime$} {$ prime$} {$ prime$} }   (we ignore the case where $ vec(z)_1 $ and $ vec(z)_2 $ are the zero vector).  The $ vec(z)_1+vec(z)_2=0 $ case is easy. For the rest, by the definition of angle, we will be finished if we show this. $ frac{vec(z)_1dot product of (vec(z)_1+vec(z)_2)}{ |vec(z)_1||vec(z)_1+vec(z)_2| } = frac{vec(z)_2dot product of (vec(z)_1+vec(z)_2)}{ |vec(z)_2||vec(z)_1+vec(z)_2| } $ But distributing inside each expression gives $ frac{vec(z)_1dot product of vec(z)_1+vec(z)_1dot product of vec(z)_2}{ |vec(z)_1||vec(z)_1+vec(z)_2| }  frac{vec(z)_2dot product of vec(z)_1+vec(z)_2dot product of vec(z)_2}{ |vec(z)_2||vec(z)_1+vec(z)_2| } $ and $ vec(z)_1dot product of vec(z)_1=|vec(z)_1|^2 =|vec(z)_2|^2=vec(z)_2dot product of vec(z)_2 $, so the two are equal.   Verify that the definition of angle is dimensionally correct: (1)~if $ k>0 $ then the cosine of the angle between $ kvec(u) $ and $ vec(v) $ equals the cosine of the angle between $ vec(u) $ and $ vec(v) $, and (2)~if $ k<0 $ then the cosine of the angle between $ kvec(u) $ and $ vec(v) $ is the negative of the cosine of the angle between $ vec(u) $ and $ vec(v) $.  We can show the two statements together. Let $ vec(u), vec(v) in ℝ^n $, write $ vec(u)=[u_1 ... u_n]  vec(v)=[v_1 ... v_n] $ and calculate. $ cos(θ)= frac(ku_1v_1+·s+ku_nv_n){ √{{(ku_1)}^2+·s+{(ku_n)}^2}√{{b_1}^2+·s+{b_n}^2} } =(k/|k|) frac{vec(u)·vec(v)}{|vec(u)||vec(v)| } =± frac{vec(u)dot product of vec(v)}{|vec(u)||vec(v)| } $   Show that the inner product operation is linear:~for $ vec(u),vec(v),vec(w) in ℝ^n $ and $ k,m in ℝ $, $vec(u)dot product of (kvec(v)+mvec(w))= k(vec(u)dot product of vec(v))+m(vec(u)dot product of vec(w))$.  Let $ vec(u)=[u_1 ... u_n],  vec(v)=[v_1 ... v_n]  vec(w)=[w_1 ... w_n] $ and then $ vec(u)dot product of [(kvec(v)+mvec(w)]) =[u_1 ... u_n]dot product of [( [kv_1 ... kv_n] +[mw_1 ... mw_n] ]) =[u_1 ... u_n]dot product of [kv_1+mw_1 ... kv_n+mw_n] =u_1(kv_1+mw_1)+·s+u_n(kv_n+mw_n) =ku_1v_1+mu_1w_1+·s+ku_nv_n+mu_nw_n =(ku_1v_1+·s+ku_nv_n)+(mu_1w_1+·s+mu_nw_n) =k(vec(u)dot product of vec(v))+m(vec(u)dot product of vec(w)) $ as required.   The geometric mean of two positive reals $ x, y $ is $ √{xy} $. It is analogous to the arithmetic mean $ (x+y)/2 $. Use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to show that the geometric mean of any $ x,y in ℝ $ is less than or equal to the arithmetic mean.  For $ x,y in ℝ^+ $, set $ vec(u)=[√{x] √{y}}  vec(v)=[√{y] √{x}} $ so that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality asserts that (after squaring) $ (√{x}√{y}+√{y}√{x})^2 ≤(√{x}√{x}+√{y}√{y})(√{y}√{y} +√{x}√{x}) (2√{x}√{y})^2 ≤(x+y)^2 √{xy} ≤(x+y/2) $ as desired.    Astrologers claim to be able to recognize trends in personality and fortune that depend on an individual's birthday by somehow incorporating where the stars were $2000$~years ago.  Suppose that instead of star-gazers coming up with stuff, math teachers who like linear algebra (we'll call them vectologers) had come up with a similar system as follows:~Consider your birthday as a row vector $[ text{month] day}$. For instance, I was born on July~$12$ so my vector would be $[7 12]$. Vectologers have made the rule that how well individuals get along with each other depends on the angle between vectors. The smaller the angle, the more harmonious the relationship.  Find the angle between your vector and mine, in radians. Would you get along better with me, or with a professor born on September~$19$? For maximum harmony in a relationship, when should the other person be born? Is there a person with whom you have a ``worst case'' relationship, i.e., your vector and theirs are orthogonal? If so, what are the birthdate(s) for such people? If not, explain why not.    For instance, a birthday of October~$12$ gives this. $ θ = arccos(frac([7 12]dot product of [10 12]){ |[7 12]|·|[10 12]| }) =arccos(frac(214){√{244}√{193}}) ≈ $0.17$~rad $ Applying the same equation to $[9 19]$ gives about $0.09$~radians. The angle will measure $0$~radians if the other person is born on the same day. It will also measure $0$ if one birthday is a scalar multiple of the other. For instance, a person born on Mar~$6$ would be harmonious with a person born on Feb~$4$.  Given a birthday, we can get Sage to plot the angle for other dates. This example shows the relationship of all dates with July~12.  sage: plot3d(lambda x, y: math.acos((x*7+y*12)/(math.sqrt(7**2+12**2)*math.sqrt(x**2+y**2))), (1,12),(1,31))    includegraphics[height=2in]{rcbday.jpg}  We want to maximize this. $ θ = arccos(frac([7 12]dot product of [m d]){ |[7 12]|·|[m d]| }) $ Of course, we cannot take $m$ or $d$ negative and so we cannot get a vector orthogonal to the given one. This Python script finds the largest angle by brute force.  import math days={1:31, # Jan 2:29, 3:31, 4:30, 5:31, 6:30, 7:31, 8:31, 9:30, 10:31, 11:30, 12:31} BDAY=(7,12) max_res=0 max_res_date=(-1,-1) for month in range(1,13): for day in range(1,days[month]+1): num=BDAY[0]*month+BDAY[1]*day denom=math.sqrt(BDAY[0]**2+BDAY[1]**2)*math.sqrt(month**2+day**2) if denom>0: res=math.acos(min(num*1.0/denom,1)) print "day:",str(month),str(day)," angle:",str(res) if res>max_res: max_res=res max_res_date=(month,day) print "For ",str(BDAY),"worst case",str(max_res),"rads, date",str(max_res_date) print " That is ",180*max_res/math.pi,"degrees"  The result is  For (7, 12) worst case 0.95958064648 rads, date (12, 1) That is 54.9799211457 degrees   A more conceptual approach is to consider the relation of all points $(month,day)$ to the point $(7,12)$. The picture below makes clear that the answer is either Dec~$1$ or Jan~$31$, depending on which is further from the birthdate. The dashed line bisects the angle between the line from the origin to Dec~$1$, and the line from the origin to Jan~$31$. Birthdays above the line are furthest from Dec~$1$ and birthdays below the line are furthest from Jan~$31$.        A ship is sailing with speed and direction $ vec(v)_1 $; the wind blows apparently (judging by the vane on the mast) in the direction of a vector $ vec(a) $; on changing the direction and speed of the ship from $ vec(v)_1 $ to $ vec(v)_2 $ the apparent wind is in the direction of a vector $ vec(b) $.  Find the vector velocity of the wind.   The actual velocity $ vec(v) $ of the wind is the sum of the ship's velocity and the apparent velocity of the wind. Without loss of generality we may assume $ vec(a) $ and $ vec(b) $ to be unit vectors, and may write $ vec(v)=vec(v)_1+svec(a)=vec(v)_2+tvec(b) $ where $ s $ and $ t $ are undetermined scalars. Take the dot product first by $ vec(a) $ and then by $ vec(b) $ to obtain $ s-tvec(a)dot product of vec(b) =vec(a)dot product of (vec(v)_2-vec(v)_1) svec(a)dot product of vec(b)-t =vec(b)dot product of (vec(v)_2-vec(v)_1) $ Multiply the second by $ vec(a)dot product of vec(b) $, subtract the result from the first, and find $ s= frac{[vec(a)-(vec(a)dot product of vec(b))vec(b)] dot product of (vec(v)_2-vec(v)_1) }{1-(vec(a)dot product of vec(b))^2}. $ Substituting in the original displayed equation, we get $ vec(v)=vec(v)_1+ frac{[vec(a)-(vec(a)dot product of vec(b))vec(b)] dot product of (vec(v)_2-vec(v)_1) vec(a)}{1-(vec(a)dot product of vec(b))^2}. $   Verify the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by first proving Lagrange's identity: $ (∑_{1≤ j≤ n} a_jb_j )^2 = (∑_{1≤ j≤ n}a_j^2) (∑_{1≤ j≤ n}b_j^2) - ∑_{1≤ k < j≤ n}(a_kb_j-a_jb_k)^2 $ and then noting that the final term is positive.            This result is an improvement over Cauchy-Schwarz because it gives a formula for the difference between the two sides. Interpret that difference in $ ℝ^2 $.  We use induction on $ n $.  In the $ n=1 $ base case the identity reduces to $ (a_1b_1)^2=({a_1}^2)({b_1}^2)-0 $ and clearly holds.  For the inductive step assume that the formula holds for the $ 0 $, ..., $ n $ cases. We will show that it then holds in the $ n+1 $ case. Start with the right-hand side $ [( ∑_{1≤ j≤ n+1}{a_j}^2]) [( ∑_{1≤ j≤ n+1}{b_j}^2]) - ∑_{1≤ k<j≤ n+1}[(a_kb_j-a_jb_k])^2 $ = [[ (∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{a_j}^2)+{a_{n+1}}^2]] [[ (∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{b_j}^2)+{b_{n+1}}^2]] - [[∑_{1≤ k<j≤ n}[(a_kb_j-a_jb_k])^2+ ∑_{1≤ k≤ n}[(a_kb_{n+1}-a_{n+1}b_k])^2 ]] = [( ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{a_j}^2]) [( ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{b_j}^2]) + ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{b_j}^2{a_{n+1}}^2 + ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{a_j}^2{b_{n+1}}^2 + {a_{n+1}}^2{b_{n+1}}^2 - [[∑_{1≤ k<j≤ n}[(a_kb_j-a_jb_k])^2+ ∑_{1≤ k≤ n}[(a_kb_{n+1}-a_{n+1}b_k])^2 ]] = [( ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{a_j}^2]) [( ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{b_j}^2]) -∑_{1≤ k<j≤ n}[(a_kb_j-a_jb_k])^2 + ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{b_j}^2{a_{n+1}}^2 + ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{a_j}^2{b_{n+1}}^2 + {a_{n+1}}^2{b_{n+1}}^2 - ∑_{1≤ k≤ n}[(a_kb_{n+1}-a_{n+1}b_k])^2 $ $ and apply the inductive hypothesis. $ = [( ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}a_jb_j])^2 + ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{b_j}^2{a_{n+1}}^2 + ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}{a_j}^2{b_{n+1}}^2 + {a_{n+1}}^2{b_{n+1}}^2 - [[∑_{1≤ k≤ n}{a_k}^2{b_{n+1}}^2 -2∑_{1≤ k≤ n}a_kb_{n+1}a_{n+1}b_k +∑_{1≤ k≤ n}{a_{n+1}}^2{b_k}^2]] = [( ∑_{1≤ j≤ n}a_jb_j])^2 +2[(∑_{1≤ k≤ n}a_kb_{n+1}a_{n+1}b_k]) +{a_{n+1}}^2{b_{n+1}}^2 = [[[(∑_{1≤ j≤ n}a_jb_j])+a_{n+1}b_{n+1}]]^2 $ to derive the left-hand side.          After developing the mechanics of Gauss's Method, we observed that it can be done in more than one way. For example, from this matrix $ ([ 2 2 4 3 ]) $ we could derive any of these three echelon form matrices. $ ([ 2 2 0 -1 ])  ([ 1 1 0 -1 ])  ([ 2 0 0 -1 ]) $ The first results from $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$. The second comes from doing $(1/2)ρ_1$ and then $-4ρ_1+ρ_2$. The third comes from $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ followed by $2ρ_2+ρ_1$ (after the first row combination the matrix is already in echelon form so the second one is extra work but it is nonetheless a legal row operation).  The fact that echelon form is not unique raises questions. Will any two echelon form versions of a linear system have the same number of free variables? If yes, will the two have exactly the same free variables? In this section we will give a way to decide if one linear system can be derived from another by row operations. The answers to both questions, both `yes', will follow from this.            Here is an extension of Gauss's Method that has some advantages.  For example To solve $ $ x + y - 2z = -2 y + 3z = 7 x - z = -1 $ $ we can start as usual by reducing it to echelon form. $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 -2 -2 0 1 3 7 0 -1 1 1 ]) for step $ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 -2 -2 0 1 3 7 0 0 4 8 ]) $ We can keep going to a second stage by making the leading entries into $ 1 $'s $ for step $(1/4)ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 -2 -2 0 1 3 7 0 0 1 2 ]) $ and then to a third stage that uses the leading entries to eliminate all of the other entries in each column by combining upwards. $ for step $-3ρ_3+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 2 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 2 ]) $ The answer is $ x=1 $, $ y=1 $, and $ z=2 $.   Using one entry to clear out the rest of a column is pivoting on that entry.   Note that the row combination operations in the first stage move left to right, from column one to column three, while the combination operations in the third stage move right to left.  For example The middle stage operations that turn the leading entries into $ 1 $'s don't interact so we can combine multiple ones into a single step. $ ([ 2 1 7 4 -2 6 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 2 1 7 0 -4 -8 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ ([ 1 1/2 7/2 0 1 2 ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 5/2 0 1 2 ]) $ The answer is $x=5/2$ and $y=2$.    This extension of Gauss's Method is the Gauss-Jordan Method or Gauss-Jordan reduction.       A matrix or linear system is in reduced echelon form if, in addition to being in echelon form, each leading entry is a~$1$ and is the only nonzero entry in its column.      The cost of using Gauss-Jordan reduction to solve a system is the additional arithmetic. The benefit is that we can just read off the solution set description.   In any echelon form system, reduced or not, we can read off when the system has an empty solution set because there is a contradictory equation. We can read off when the system has a one-element solution set because there is no contradiction and every variable is the leading variable in some row. And, we can read off when the system has an infinite solution set because there is no contradiction and at least one variable is free.  However, in reduced echelon form we can read off not just the size of the solution set but also its description. We have no trouble describing the solution set when it is empty, of course. and~ show how in a single element solution set case the single element is in the column of constants. The next example shows how to read the parametrization of an infinite solution set.  For example $ ([ 2 6 1 2 5 0 3 1 4 1 0 3 1 2 5 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 2 6 1 2 5 0 3 1 4 1 0 0 0 -2 4 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ repeat step $-(4/3)ρ_3+ρ_2$ repeat step $-3ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 -1/2 0 -9/2 0 1 1/3 0 3 0 0 0 1 -2 ]) $ As a linear system this is $ $ x_1 - 1/2x_3 = -9/2 x_2 + 1/3x_3 = 3 {}{} x_4 = -2 $ $ so a solution set description is this. $ S={[x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4] =[-9/2 3 0 -2] +[1/2 -1/3 1 0]x_3 such that x_3 in ℝ} $   Thus echelon form isn't some kind of one best form for systems. Other forms, such as reduced echelon form, have advantages and disadvantages. Instead of picturing linear systems (and the associated matrices) as things we operate on, always directed toward the goal of echelon form, we can think of them as interrelated when we can get from one to another by row operations. The rest of this subsection develops this relationship.    Elementary row operations are reversible.      For any matrix $ A $, the effect of swapping rows is reversed by swapping them back, multiplying a row by a nonzero $ k $ is undone by multiplying by $1/k$, and adding a multiple of row $ i $ to row $ j $ (with $i ≠ j$) is undone by subtracting the same multiple of row $ i $ from row $ j $. $ A for step $ρ_i↔ρ_j$ repeat step $ρ_j↔ρ_i$ A  A for step $kρ_i$ repeat step $(1/k)ρ_i$ A  A for step $kρ_i+ρ_j$ repeat step $-kρ_i+ρ_j$ A $  (We need the $i ≠ j$ condition; see .)   Again, the point of view that we are developing, supported now by the lemma, is that the term `reduces to' is misleading:~where $ A--> B $, we shouldn't think of $ B $ as after~$ A $ or simpler than~$A$. Instead we should think of the two matrices as interrelated. Below is a picture. It shows the matrices from the start of this section and their reduced echelon form version in a cluster, as inter-reducible.      We say that matrices that reduce to each other are equivalent with respect to the relationship of row reducibility. The next result justifies this, using the definition of an equivalence.     Between matrices, `reduces to' is an equivalence re-la-tion.      We must check the conditions (i)~reflexivity, that any matrix reduces to itself, (ii)~symmetry, that if $ A $ reduces to $ B $ then $ B $ reduces to $ A $, and (iii)~transitivity, that if $ A $ reduces to $ B $ and $ B $ reduces to $ C $ then $ A $ reduces to $ C $.    Reflexivity is easy; any matrix reduces to itself in zero-many operations.  The relationship is symmetric by the prior lemma- if $ A $ reduces to $ B $ by some row operations then also $ B $ reduces to $ A $ by reversing those operations.    For transitivity, suppose that $ A $ reduces to $ B $ and that $ B $ reduces to $ C $. Following the reduction steps from $A ->·s-> B$ with those from $B ->·s-> C$ gives a reduction from $ A $ to $ C $.      Two matrices that are interreducible by elementary row operations are row equivalent.      The diagram below shows the collection of all matrices as a box. Inside that box each matrix lies in a class. Matrices are in the same class if and only if they are interreducible. The classes are disjoint- no matrix is in two distinct classes. We have partitioned the collection of matrices into row equivalence classes.     One of the classes is the cluster of interrelated matrices from the start of this section pictured earlier, expanded to include all of the nonsingular $N by N$ matrices.  The next subsection proves that the reduced echelon form of a matrix is unique. Rephrased in terms of the row-equivalence relationship, we shall prove that every matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon form matrix. In terms of the partition what we shall prove is:~every equivalence class contains one and only one reduced echelon form matrix. So each reduced echelon form matrix serves as a representative of its class.    Use Gauss-Jordan reduction to solve each system.  $ $ x + y = 2 x - y = 0 $ $ $ x - z = 4 2x + 2y = 1 $ $ $ 3x - 2y = 1 6x + y = 1/2 $ $ $ 2x - y = -1 x + 3y - z = 5 y + 2z = 5 $   These answers show only the Gauss-Jordan reduction. With it, describing the solution set is easy.  The solution set contains only a single element. $ ([ 1 1 2 1 -1 0 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 2 0 -2 -2 ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 2 0 1 1 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 1 0 1 1 ]) $ The solution set has one parameter. $ ([ 1 0 -1 4 2 2 0 1 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 -1 4 0 2 2 -7 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 -1 4 0 1 1 -7/2 ]) $ There is a unique solution. $ ([ 3 -2 1 6 1 1/2 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 3 -2 1 0 5 -3/2 ]) for step $(1/3)ρ_1$ ([ 1 -2/3 1/3 0 1 -3/10 ]) for step $(2/3)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 2/15 0 1 -3/10 ]) $ A row swap in the second step makes the arithmetic easier. $ ([ 2 -1 0 -1 1 3 -1 5 0 1 2 5 ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 2 -1 0 -1 0 7/2 -1 11/2 0 1 2 5 ]) $ for step $ρ_2↔ρ_3$ ([ 2 -1 0 -1 0 1 2 5 0 7/2 -1 11/2 ]) for step $-(7/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 2 -1 0 -1 0 1 2 5 0 0 -8 -12 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ ([ 1 -1/2 0 -1/2 0 1 2 5 0 0 1 3/2 ]) for step $-2ρ_3+ρ_2$ ([ 1 -1/2 0 -1/2 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 3/2 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 1/2 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 3/2 ]) $ $   Do Gauss-Jordan reduction.   $$ x + y - z = 3 2x - y - z = 1 3x + y + 2z = 0 $$  $$ x + y + 2z = 0 2x - y + z = 1 4x + y + 5z = 1 $$     $ ([ 1 1 -1 3 2 -1 -1 1 3 1 2 0 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 -1 3 0 -3 -1 1 0 -2 5 -9 ]) $ for step $-(2/3)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 -1 3 0 -3 -1 1 0 0 13/3 -17/3 ]) for step $-(1/3)ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 -1 3 0 1 -1/3 5/3 0 0 1 -17/13 ]) for step $ρ_3+ρ_1$ ([ 1 1 0 22/13 0 1 0 16/13 0 0 1 -17/13 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 6/13 0 1 0 16/13 0 0 1 -17/13 ]) $ $  $ ([ 1 1 2 0 2 -1 1 1 4 1 5 1 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 2 0 0 -3 -3 1 0 -3 -3 1 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 2 0 0 -3 -3 1 0 0 0 0 ]) for step $-(1/3)ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 2 0 0 1 1 -1/3 0 0 0 0 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 1 1/3 0 1 1 -1/3 0 0 0 0 ]) $    Find the reduced echelon form of each matrix.  $ ([ 2 1 1 3 ]) $ $ ([ 1 3 1 2 0 4 -1 -3 -3 ]) $ $ ([ 1 0 3 1 2 1 4 2 1 5 3 4 8 1 2 ]) $ $ ([ 0 1 3 2 0 0 5 6 1 5 1 5 ]) $   Use Gauss-Jordan reduction.

List the reduced echelon forms possible for each size.  $ N by N $ $ N by M $ $ N by M $ $ N by N $   In the cases listed below, we take $a,b in ℝ$. Thus, some canonical forms listed below actually include infinitely many cases. In particular, they includes the cases $a=0$ and $b=0$.   $([ 0 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 1 a 0 0 ])$, $([ 0 1 0 0 ])$, $([ 1 0 0 1 ])$  $([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 1 a b 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 0 1 a 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 0 0 1 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 1 0 a 0 1 b ])$, $([ 1 a 0 0 0 1 ])$, $([ 0 1 0 0 0 1 ])$  $([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 1 a 0 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 1 0 0 1 0 0 ])$  $([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 1 a b 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 0 1 a 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 1 0 a 0 1 b 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 1 a 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ])$, $([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ])$    What results from applying Gauss-Jordan reduction to a nonsingular matrix?  A nonsingular homogeneous linear system has a unique solution. So a nonsingular matrix must reduce to a (square) matrix that is all $ 0 $'s except for $ 1 $'s down the upper-left to lower-right diagonal, such as these. $ ([ 1 0 0 1 ])  ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $   Consider the following relationship on the set of $N by N$ matrices: we say that $A$ is sum-what like $B$ if the sum of all of the entries in $A$ is the same as the sum of all the entries in $B$. For instance, the zero matrix would be sum-what like the matrix whose first row had two sevens, and whose second row had two negative sevens. Prove or disprove that this is an equivalence relation on the set of $N by N$ matrices.  It is an equivalence relation. To prove that we must check that the relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  Assume that all matrices are $N by N$. For reflexive, we note that a matrix has the same sum of entries as itself. For symmetric, we assume $A$ has the same sum of entries as~$B$ and obviously then $B$ has the same sum of entries as~$A$. Transitivity is no harder- if $A$ has the same sum of entries as $B$ and $B$ has the same sum of entries as $C$ then $A$ has the same as $C$.   The proof of contains a reference to the $i ≠ j$ condition on the row combination operation.  Write down a $N by N$ matrix with nonzero entries, and show that the $-1·ρ_1+ρ_1$ operation is not reversed by $1·ρ_1+ρ_1$. Expand the proof of that lemma to make explicit exactly where it uses the $i ≠ j$ condition on combining.    For instance, $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_1$ ([ 0 0 3 4 ]) for step $ρ_1+ρ_1$ ([ 0 0 3 4 ]) $ leaves the matrix changed. This operation $ ([ ...} a_{i,1} ·s a_{i,n} ...} a_{j,1} ·s a_{j,n} ...} ]) for step $kρ_i+ρ_j$ ([ ...} a_{i,1} ·s a_{i,n} ...} ka_{i,1}+a_{j,1} ·s ka_{i,n}+a_{j,n} ...} ]) $ leaves the $i$-th row unchanged because of the $i ≠ j$ restriction. Because the $i$-th row is unchanged, this operation $ for step $-kρ_i+ρ_j$ ([ ...} a_{i,1} ·s a_{i,n} ...} -ka_{i,1}+ka_{i,1}+a_{j,1} ·s -ka_{i,n}+ka_{i,n}+a_{j,n} ...} ]) $ returns the $j$-th row to its original state.      Consider the set of students in a class. Which of the following relationships are equivalence relations? Explain each answer in at least a sentence.  Two students $x, y$ are related if $x$ has taken at least as many math classes as $y$. Students $x, y$ are related if they have names that start with the same letter.   To be an equivalence, each relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  This relation is not symmetric because if $x$ has taken $4$~classes and $y$ has taken $3$ then $x$ is related to $y$ but $y$ is not related to $x$. This is reflexive because $x$'s name starts with the same letter as does $x$'s. It is symmetric because if $x$'s name starts with the same letter as $y$'s then $y$'s starts with the same letter as does~$x$'s. And it is transitive because if $x$'s name starts with the same letter as does~$y$'s and $y$'s name starts with the same letter as does $z$'s then $x$'s starts with the same letter as does $z$'s. So it is an equivalence.    Show that each of these is an equivalence on the set of $N by N$ matrices. Describe the equivalence classes.  Two matrices are related if they have the same product down the diagonal, that is, if the product of the entries in the upper left and lower right are equal. Two matrices are related if they both have at least one entry that is a~$1$, or if neither does.   For each we must check the three conditions of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.  Any matrix clearly has the same product down the diagonal as itself, so the relation is reflexive. The relation is symmetric because if $A$ has the same product down its diagonal as does~$B$, if $a_{1,1}· a_{2,2}=b_{1,1}· b_{2,2}$, then $B$ has the same product as does~$A$.  Transitivity is similar: suppose that $A$'s product is~$r$ and that it equals $B$'s product. Suppose also that $B$'s product equals $C$'s. Then all three have a product of~$r$, and $A$'s equals~$C$'s.  There is an equivalence class for each real number, namely the class contains all $N by N$ matrices whose product down the diagonal is that real. For reflexivity, if the matrix $A$ has a~$1$ entry then it is related to itself while if it does not then it is also related to itself. Symmetry also has two cases: suppose that $A$ and~$B$ are related. If $A$ has a~$1$ entry then so does~$B$, and thus $B$ is related to~$A$. If $A$ has no~$1$ then neither does $B$, and again $B$ is related to $A$.  For transitivity, suppose that $A$ is related to~$B$ and $B$ to~$C$. If $A$ has a~$1$ entry then so does~$B$, and because $B$ is related to~$C$, therefore so does~$C$, and hence $A$ is related to~$C$. Likewise, if $A$ has no~$1$ then neither does~$B$, and consequently neither does~$C$, giving the conclusion that $A$ is related to~$C$.  There are exactly two equivalence classes, one containing any $N by N$ matrix that has at least one entry that is a~$1$, and the other containing all the matrices that have no $1$'s.   Show that each is not an equivalence on the set of $N by N$ matrices.  Two matrices $A,B$ are related if $a_{1,1}=-b_{1,1}$. Two matrices are related if the sum of their entries are within $5$, that is, $A$ is related to~$B$ if $|(a_{1,1}+·s+a_{2,2})-(b_{1,1}+·s+b_{2,2})|<5$.    This relation is not reflexive. For instance, any matrix with an upper-left entry of~$1$ is not related to itself. This relation is not transitive. For these three, $A$ is related to~$B$, and $B$ is related to~$C$, but $A$ is not related to~$C$. $ A=([ 0 0 0 0 ]), B=([ 4 0 0 0 ]), C=([ 8 0 0 0 ]), $                         We will close this chapter by proving that every matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon form matrix. The ideas here will reappear, and be further developed, in the next chapter.                       The crucial observation concerns how row operations act to transform one matrix into another: the new rows are linear combinations of the old.  For example Consider this Gauss-Jordan reduction. $ ([ 2 1 0 1 3 5 ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 2 1 0 0 5/2 5 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ ([ 1 1/2 0 0 1 2 ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 -1 0 1 2 ]) $ Denoting those matrices $A-> D-> G-> B$ and writing the rows of $A$ as $α_1$ and $α_2$, etc., we have this. $ ($ α_1 α_2 $) for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ($ δ_1=α_1 δ_2=-(1/2)α_1+α_2 $) for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ ($ γ_1=(1/2)α_1 γ_2=-(1/5)α_1+(2/5)α_2 $) for step $-(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ($ β_1=(3/5)α_1-(1/5)α_2 β_2=-(1/5)α_1+(2/5)α_2 $) $   For example The fact that Gaussian operations combine rows linearly also holds if there is a row swap. With this $ A $, $ D $, $ G $, and $ B $ $ ([ 0 2 1 1 ]) for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 0 2 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 0 1 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ we get these linear relationships. $ ($ vec(α)_1 vec(α)_2 $) for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ ($ vec(δ)_1 =vec(α)_2 vec(δ)_2 =vec(α)_1 $) for step $(1/2)ρ_2$ ($ vec(γ)_1 =vec(α)_2 vec(γ)_2 =(1/2)vec(α)_1 $) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ($ vec(β)_1 =(-1/2)vec(α)_1+1·vec(α)_2 vec(β)_2 =(1/2)vec(α)_1 $) $   In summary, Gauss's Method systematically finds a suitable sequence of linear combinations of the rows.              [Linear Combination Lemma]  A linear combination of linear combinations is a linear combination.      Given the set $c_{1,1}x_1+...+c_{1,n}x_n$ through $c_{m,1}x_1+...+c_{m,n}x_n$ of linear combinations of the $x$'s, consider a combination of those $ d_1(c_{1,1}x_1+...+c_{1,n}x_n)+...+d_m(c_{m,1}x_1+...+c_{m,n}x_n) $ where the $d$'s are scalars along with the $c$'s. Distributing those $d$'s and regrouping gives $    =(d_1c_{1,1}+...+d_mc_{m,1})x_1+...+(d_1c_{1,n}+...+d_mc_{m,n})x_n $ which is also a linear combination of the $x$'s.       Where one matrix reduces to another, each row of the second is a linear combination of the rows of the first.                       For any two interreducible matrices $A$ and~$B$ there is some minimum number of row operations that will take one to the other. We proceed by induction on that number.  In the base step, that we can go from the first to the second using zero reduction operations, the two matrices are equal. Then each row of $B$ is trivially a combination of $A$'s rows $vec(β)_i =0·vec(α)_1+·s+1·vec(α)_i+·s+0·vec(α)_m$.    For the inductive step assume the inductive hypothesis:~with $k≥ 0$, any matrix that can be derived from $ A $ in $ k $ or fewer operations has rows that are linear combinations of $A$'s rows. Consider a matrix~$B$ such that reducing $ A $ to~$ B $ requires $k+1$ operations. In that reduction there is a next-to-last matrix~$G$, so that $A-->·s--> G--> B$. The inductive hypothesis applies to this $ G $ because it is only $k$ steps away from $ A $. That is, each row of $ G $ is a linear combination of the rows of $ A $.    We will verify that the rows of~$B$ are linear combinations of the rows of~$G$. Then the Linear Combination Lemma, , applies to show that the rows of~$B$ are linear combinations of the rows of~$A$.  If the row operation taking $ G $ to~$ B $ is a swap then the rows of $B$ are just the rows of $G$ reordered and each row of $B$ is a linear combination of the rows of $G$. If the operation taking $G$ to~$B$ is multiplication of a row by a scalar~$cρ_i$ then $vec(β)_i=cvec(γ)_i$ and the other rows are unchanged. Finally, if the row operation is adding a multiple of one row to another $rρ_i+ρ_j$ then only row~$j$ of $B$ differs from the matching row of~$G$, and $vec(β)_j=rγ_i+γ_j$, which is indeed a linear combinations of the rows of $G$.   Because we have proved both a base step and an inductive step, the proposition follows by the principle of mathematical induction.   We now have the insight that Gauss's Method builds linear combinations of the rows. But of course its goal is to end in echelon form, since that is a particularly basic version of a linear system, as it has isolated the variables. For instance, in this matrix $ R=([ 2 3 7 8 0 0 0 0 1 5 1 1 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 ]) $ $x_1$ has been removed from $x_5$'s equation. That is, Gauss's Method has made $x_5$'s row in some way independent of $x_1$'s row.  The following result makes this intuition precise. What Gauss's Method eliminates is linear relationships among the rows.    In an echelon form matrix, no nonzero row is a linear combination of the other nonzero rows.      Let $R$ be an echelon form matrix and consider its non-$ vec(0) $ rows. First observe that if we have a row written as a combination of the others $vec(ρ)_i=c_1vec(ρ)_1+·s+c_{i-1}vec(ρ)_{i-1}+ c_{i+1}vec(ρ)_{i+1}+·s+c_mvec(ρ)_m$ then we can rewrite that equation as $ vec(0)=c_1vec(ρ)_1+·s+c_{i-1}vec(ρ)_{i-1}+c_ivec(ρ)_i+ c_{i+1}vec(ρ)_{i+1}+·s+c_mvec(ρ)_m  $ where not all the coefficients are zero; specifically, $c_i=-1$. The converse holds also:~given equation~($*$) where some $c_i ≠ 0$ we could express $vec(ρ)_i$ as a combination of the other rows by moving $c_ivec(ρ)_i$ to the left and dividing by $-c_i$. Therefore we will have proved the theorem if we show that in~($*$) all of the coefficients are~$0$. For that we use induction on the row number~$i$.    The base case is the first row~$i=1$ (if there is no such nonzero row, so that $R$ is the zero matrix, then the lemma holds vacuously). Let $l_i$ be the column number of the leading entry in row~$i$. Consider the entry of each row that is in column~$l_1$. Equation~($*$) gives this. $ 0=c_1r_{1,l_1}+c_2r_{2,l_1}+·s+c_mr_{m,l_1}  $ The matrix is in echelon form so every row after the first has a zero entry in that column $r_{2,l_1}=·s=r_{m,l_1}=0$. Thus equation~($**$) shows that $c_1=0$, because $r_{1,l_1} ≠ 0$ as it leads the row.    The inductive step is much the same as the base step. Again consider equation~($*$). We will prove that if the coefficient $c_i$ is $0$ for each row index $i in{1,...,k}$ then $c_{k+1}$ is also $0$. We focus on the entries from column~$l_{k+1}$. $ 0=c_1r_{1,l_{k+1}}+·s+c_{k+1}r_{k+1,l_{k+1}}+·s+c_mr_{m,l_{k+1}} $ By the inductive hypothesis $c_1$, ... $c_k$ are all $0$ so this reduces to the equation $0=c_{k+1}r_{k+1,l_{k+1}}+·s+c_mr_{m,l_{k+1}}$. The matrix is in echelon form so the entries $r_{k+2,l_{k+1}}$, ..., $r_{m,l_{k+1}}$ are all~$0$. Thus $c_{k+1}=0$, because $r_{k+1,l_{k+1}} ≠ 0$ as it is the leading entry.       Each matrix is row equivalent to a unique reduced echelon form matrix.      Fix a number of rows $ m $. We will proceed by induction on the number of columns $ n $.  The base case is that the matrix has $ n=1 $ column. If this is the zero matrix then its echelon form is the zero matrix. If instead it has any nonzero entries then when the matrix is brought to reduced echelon form it must have at least one nonzero entry, which must be a $ 1 $ in the first row. Either way, its reduced echelon form is unique.    For the inductive step we assume that $ n>1 $ and that all $ m $~row matrices having fewer than~$ n $ columns have a unique reduced echelon form. Consider an $ N by M $ matrix $ A $ and suppose that $ B $ and $ C $ are two reduced echelon form matrices derived from $ A $. We will show that these two must be equal.    Let $ Â $ be the matrix consisting of the first $ n-1 $ columns of $ A $. Observe that    any sequence of row operations that bring $ A $ to reduced echelon form will also bring $ Â $ to reduced echelon form. By the inductive hypothesis this reduced echelon form of $ Â $ is unique, so if $ B $ and $ C $ differ then the difference must occur in column~$ n $.   We finish the inductive step, and the argument, by showing that the two cannot differ only in that column.  Consider a homogeneous system of equations for which $ A $ is the matrix of coefficients. $ $ a_{1,1}x_1 + a_{1,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{1,n}x_n = 0 a_{2,1}x_1 + a_{2,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{2,n}x_n = 0 ... a_{m,1}x_1 + a_{m,2}x_2 + ·s + a_{m,n}x_n = 0 $  $ By Theorem~One.I.  the set of solutions to that system is the same as the set of solutions to $B$'s system $ $ b_{1,1}x_1 + b_{1,2}x_2 + ·s + b_{1,n}x_n = 0 b_{2,1}x_1 + b_{2,2}x_2 + ·s + b_{2,n}x_n = 0 ... b_{m,1}x_1 + b_{m,2}x_2 + ·s + b_{m,n}x_n = 0 $  $ and to $C$'s. $  $ c_{1,1}x_1 + c_{1,2}x_2 + ·s + c_{1,n}x_n = 0 c_{2,1}x_1 + c_{2,2}x_2 + ·s + c_{2,n}x_n = 0 ... c_{m,1}x_1 + c_{m,2}x_2 + ·s + c_{m,n}x_n = 0 $ tag{$mathord(*)mathord(*)mathord(*)$} $   With $ B $ and $ C $ different only in column~$ n $, suppose that they differ in row~$ i $. Subtract row~$ i $ of ($mathord(*)mathord(*)mathord(*)$) from row~$ i $ of ($**$) to get the equation $ (b_{i,n}-c_{i,n})· x_n=0 $. We've assumed that $ b_{i,n} ≠ c_{i,n} $ so $x_n=0$. Thus in ($**$) and~($mathord(*)mathord(*)mathord(*)$) the $ n $-th column contains a leading entry, or else the variable $ x_n $ would be free. That's a contradiction because with $ B $ and $ C $ equal on the first $ n-1 $~columns, the leading entries in the $ n $-th column would have to be in the same row, and with both matrices in reduced echelon form, both leading entries would have to be $1$, and would have to be the only nonzero entries in that column. So $ B=C $.    That result answers the two questions from this section's introduction:~do any two echelon form versions of a linear system have the same number of free variables, and if so are they exactly the same variables? We get from any echelon form version to the reduced echelon form by eliminating up, so any echelon form version of a system has the same free variables as the reduced echelon form, and therefore uniqueness of reduced echelon form gives that the same variables are free in all echelon form version of a system. Thus both questions are answered ``yes.'' There is no linear system and no combination of row operations such that, say, we could solve the system one way and get $y$ and $z$ free but solve it another way and get $y$ and $w$ free.  We close with a recap. In Gauss's Method we start with a matrix and then derive a sequence of other matrices. We defined two matrices to be related if we can derive one from the other. That relation is an equivalence relation, called row equivalence, and so partitions the set of all matrices into row equivalence classes.    (There are infinitely many matrices in the pictured class, but we've only got room to show two.) We have proved there is one and only one reduced echelon form matrix in each row equivalence class.  So the reduced echelon form is a canonical formspacefactor=1000  for row equivalence: the reduced echelon form matrices are representatives of the classes.      The idea here is that one way to understand a mathematical situation is by being able to classify the cases that can happen. This is a theme in this book and we have seen this several times already. We classified solution sets of linear systems into the no-elements, one-element, and infinitely-many elements cases. We also classified linear systems with the same number of equations as unknowns into the nonsingular and singular cases.  Here, where we are investigating row equivalence, we know that the set of all matrices breaks into the row equivalence classes and we now have a way to put our finger on each of those classes- we can think of the matrices in a class as derived by row operations from the unique reduced echelon form matrix in that class.  Put in more operational terms, uniqueness of reduced echelon form lets us answer questions about the classes by translating them into questions about the representatives. For instance, as promised in this section's opening, we now can decide whether one matrix can be derived from another by row reduction. We apply the Gauss-Jordan procedure to both and see if they yield the same reduced echelon form.  For example These matrices are not row equivalent $ ([ 1 -3 -2 6 ])  ([ 1 -3 -2 5 ]) $ because their reduced echelon forms are not equal. $ ([ 1 -3 0 0 ])  ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $   For example Any nonsingular $ N by N $ matrix Gauss-Jordan reduces to this. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $   For example We can describe all the classes by listing all possible reduced echelon form matrices. Any $N by N$ matrix lies in one of these:~the class of matrices row equivalent to this, $ ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) $ the infinitely many classes of matrices row equivalent to one of this type $ ([ 1 a 0 0 ]) $ where $ a in ℝ $ (including $a=0$), the class of matrices row equivalent to this, $ ([ 0 1 0 0 ]) $ and the class of matrices row equivalent to this $ ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ (this is the class of nonsingular $N by N$ matrices).       Decide if the matrices are row equivalent.  $ ([ 1 2 4 8 ]), ([ 0 1 1 2 ]) $ $ ([ 1 0 2 3 -1 1 5 -1 5 ]), ([ 1 0 2 0 2 10 2 0 4 ]) $ $ ([ 2 1 -1 1 1 0 4 3 -1 ]), ([ 1 0 2 0 2 10 ]) $ $ ([ 1 1 1 -1 2 2 ]), ([ 0 3 -1 2 2 5 ]) $ $ ([ 1 1 1 0 0 3 ]), ([ 0 1 2 1 -1 1 ]) $   Bring each to reduced echelon form and compare.  The first gives $ for step $-4ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 0 0 ]) $ while the second gives $ for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 0 1 ]) for step $-2ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ The two reduced echelon form matrices are not identical, and so the original matrices are not row equivalent. The first is this. $ for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 2 0 -1 -5 0 -1 -5 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 2 0 -1 -5 0 0 0 ]) for step $-ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 2 0 1 5 0 0 0 ]) $ The second is this. $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 2 0 2 10 0 0 0 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 2 0 1 5 0 0 0 ]) $ These two are row equivalent. These two are not row equivalent because they have different sizes. The first, $ for step $ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 1 0 3 3 ]) for step $(1/3)ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 1 0 1 1 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 1 ]) $ and the second. $ for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ ([ 2 2 5 0 3 -1 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ ([ 1 1 5/2 0 1 -1/3 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 17/6 0 1 -1/3 ]) $ These are not row equivalent. Here the first is $ for step $(1/3)ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 1 0 0 1 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $ while this is the second. $ for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ ([ 1 -1 1 0 1 2 ]) for step $ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 3 0 1 2 ]) $ These are not row equivalent.    Describe the matrices in each of the classes represented in .  First, the only matrix row equivalent to the matrix of all $ 0 $'s is itself (since row operations have no effect).  Second, the matrices that reduce to $ ([ 1 a 0 0 ]) $ have the form $ ([ b ba c ca ]) $ (where $ a,b,c in ℝ $, and $b$ and $c$ are not both zero).  Next, the matrices that reduce to $ ([ 0 1 0 0 ]) $ have the form $ ([ 0 a 0 b ]) $ (where $ a,b in ℝ $, and not both are zero).  Finally, the matrices that reduce to $ ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ are the nonsingular matrices. That's because a linear system for which this is the matrix of coefficients will have a unique solution, and that is the definition of nonsingular. (Another way to say the same thing is to say that they fall into none of the above classes.)   Describe all matrices in the row equivalence class of these.  $ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]) $ $ ([ 1 2 2 4 ]) $ $ ([ 1 1 1 3 ]) $    They have the form $ ([ a 0 b 0 ]) $ where $ a,b in ℝ $. They have this form (for $ a,b in ℝ $). $ ([ 1a 2a 1b 2b ]) $ They have the form $ ([ a b c d ]) $ (for $ a,b,c,d in ℝ $) where $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $. (This is the formula that determines when a $ N by N $ matrix is nonsingular.)    How many row equivalence classes are there?  Infinitely many. For instance, in $ ([ 1 k 0 0 ]) $ each $k in ℝ$ gives a different class.   Can row equivalence classes contain different-sized matrices?  No. Row operations do not change the size of a matrix.   How big are the row equivalence classes?  Show that for any matrix of all zeros, the class is finite. Do any other classes contain only finitely many members?    A row operation on a matrix of zeros has no effect. Thus each such matrix is alone in its row equivalence class. No. Any nonzero entry can be rescaled.    Give two reduced echelon form matrices that have their leading entries in the same columns, but that are not row equivalent.  Here are two. $ ([ 1 1 0 0 0 1 ]) and ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) $   Show that any two $ N by N $ nonsingular matrices are row equivalent. Are any two singular matrices row equivalent?  Any two $ N by N $ nonsingular matrices have the same reduced echelon form, namely the matrix with all $ 0 $'s except for $ 1 $'s down the diagonal. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 ... 0 0 1 ]) $  Two same-sized singular matrices need not be row equivalent. For example, these two $ N by N $ singular matrices are not row equivalent. $ ([ 1 1 0 0 ]) and ([ 1 0 0 0 ]) $   Describe all of the row equivalence classes containing these.  $ N by N $~matrices $ N by M $~matrices $ N by M $~matrices $ N by N $~matrices   Since there is one and only one reduced echelon form matrix in each class, we can just list the possible reduced echelon form matrices.  For that list, see the answer for .    Show that a vector $vec(β)_0$ is a linear combination of members of the set ${vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n}$ if and only if there is a linear relationship $0=c_0vec(β)_0+·s+c_nsetvec(β)_n$ where $c_0$ is not zero. (Hint. Watch out for the $vec(β)_0=0$ case.) Use that to simplify the proof of .    If there is a linear relationship where $c_0$ is not zero then we can subtract $c_0vec(β)_0$ from both sides and divide by $-c_0$ to get $vec(β)_0$ as a linear combination of the others. (Remark: if there are no other vectors in the set- if the relationship is, say, $0=3·0$- then the statement is still true because the zero vector is by definition the sum of the empty set of vectors.)  Conversely, if $vec(β)_0$ is a combination of the others $vec(β)_0=c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n$ then subtracting $vec(β)_0$ from both sides gives a relationship where at least one of the coefficients is nonzero; namely, the $-1$ in front of $vec(β)_0$. The first row is not a linear combination of the others for the reason given in the proof:~in the equation of components from the column containing the leading entry of the first row, the only nonzero entry is the leading entry from the first row, so its coefficient must be zero. Thus, from the prior part of this exercise, the first row is in no linear relationship with the other rows.  Thus, when considering whether the second row can be in a linear relationship with the other rows, we can leave the first row out. But now the argument just applied to the first row will apply to the second row. (That is, we are arguing here by induction.)                Three truck drivers went into a roadside cafe. One truck driver purchased four sandwiches, a cup of coffee, and ten doughnuts for $$8.45$. Another driver purchased three sandwiches, a cup of coffee, and seven doughnuts for $$6.30$. What did the third truck driver pay for a sandwich, a cup of coffee, and a doughnut?  We know that $4s+c+10d=8.45$ and that $3s+c+7d=6.30$, and we'd like to know what $s+c+d$ is. Fortunately, $s+c+d$ is a linear combination of $4s+c+10d$ and $3s+c+7d$. Calling the unknown price $p$, we have this reduction. $ ([ 4 1 10 8.45 3 1 7 6.30 1 1 1 p ]) for step $-(3/4)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 4 1 10 8.45 0 1/4 -1/2 -0.0375 0 3/4 -3/2 p-2.1125 ]) for step $-3ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 4 1 10 8.45 0 1/4 -1/2 -0.0375 0 0 0 p-2.00 ]) $ The price paid is $$2.00$.                              The Linear Combination Lemma says which equations can be gotten from Gaussian reduction of a given linear system.  Produce an equation not implied by this system. $ $ 3x + 4y = 8 2x + y = 3 $ $ Can any equation be derived from an inconsistent system?    An easy answer is this. $ 0=3 $ For a less wise-guy-ish answer, solve the system: $ ([ 3 -1 8 2 1 3 ]) for step $-(2/3)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 3 -1 8 0 5/3 -7/3 ]) $ gives $ y=-7/5 $ and $ x=11/5 $. Now any equation not satisfied by $ (-7/5,11/5) $ will do, e.g., $ 5x+5y=3 $. Every equation can be derived from an inconsistent system. For instance, here is how to derive $ 3x+2y=4 $ from $ 0=5 $. First, $ 0=5 for step $(3/5)ρ_1$ 0=3 for step $xρ_1$ 0=3x $ (validity of the $ x=0 $ case is separate but clear). Similarly, $ 0=2y $. Ditto for $ 0=4 $. But now, $ 0+0=0 $ gives $ 3x+2y=4 $.     Extend the definition of row equivalence to linear systems. Under your definition, do equivalent systems have the same solution set?  Define linear systems to be equivalent if their augmented matrices are row equivalent. The proof that equivalent systems have the same solution set is easy.   In this matrix $ ([ 1 2 3 3 0 3 1 4 5 ]) $ the first and second columns add to the third.  Show that remains true under any row operation. Make a conjecture. Prove that it holds.    The three possible row swaps are easy, as are the three possible rescalings. One of the six possible row combinations is $ kρ_1+ρ_2 $: $ ([ 1 2 3 k· 1+3 k· 2+0 k· 3+3 1 4 5 ]) $ and again the first and second columns add to the third. The other five combinations are similar. The obvious conjecture is that row operations do not change linear relationships among columns. A case-by-case proof follows the sketch given in the first item.               This is a PASCAL routine to do $ kρ_i+ρ_j $ to an augmented matrix.  begin(verbatim) PROCEDURE Pivot(VAR LinSys : AugMat; k : REAL; i, j : INTEGER) VAR Col : INTEGER; BEGIN FOR Col:=1 TO NumVars+1 DO LinSys[j,Col]:=k*LinSys[i,Col]+LinSys[j,Col]; END; end(verbatim)  Of course this is only one part of a whole program, but it makes the point that Gaussian reduction is ideal for computer coding.  There are pitfalls, however. For example, some arise from the computer's use of finite-precision approximations of real numbers.  These systems provide a simple example.  setlength(\unitlength){4pt} (-5,-18) thinlines {(0,0) put(0,0){ } put(0,0){ } put(-0.5,3){ } put(-0.5,6){ } put(-0.5,9){ } put(-0.5,-3){ } put(-0.5,-6){ } put(-0.5,-9){ }  put(0,0){ } put(0,0){ } put(3,-0.5){ } put(6,-0.5){ } put(9,-0.5){ } put(-3,-0.5){ } put(-6,-0.5){ } put(-9,-0.5){ }  }  put(0,-13){(0,0)[t]{ $$ x + 2y = 3 3x - 2y = 1 $$ } } put(40,-13){(0,0)[t]{ $$ x + 2y = 3 1.00000001x + 2y = 3.00000001 $$ } } thicklines { } { }   put(0,-1.5){ } put(0,-1.5){ }  put(49.5,0){ } put(48.5,0){ }    (The second two lines are hard to tell apart.) Both have $ (1,1) $ as their unique solution.  In the first system, some small change in the numbers will produce only a small change in the solution: $ $ x + 2y = 3 3x - 2y = 1.008 $ $ gives a solution of $ (1.002,0.999) $. Geometrically, changing one of the lines by a small amount does not change the intersection point by very much.  That's not true for the second system. A small change in the coefficients $ $ x + 2y = 3 1.00000001x + 2y = 3.00000003 $ $ leads to a completely different answer: $ (3,0) $.  The solution of the second example varies wildly, depending on a $ 9 $-th digit. That's bad news for a machine using $ 8 $ digits to represent reals. In short, systems that are nearly singular may be hard to compute with.  Another thing that can go wrong is error propagation. In a system with a large number of equations (say, 100 or more), small rounding errors early in the procedure can snowball to overwhelm the solution at the end.  These issues, and many others like them, are outside the scope of this book, but remember that just because Gauss's Method always works in theory and just because a program correctly implements that method and just because the answer appears on green-bar paper, doesn't mean that answer is right. In practice, always use a package where experts have worked hard to counter what can go wrong.         The linear systems in this chapter are small enough that their solution by hand is easy. For large systems, including those involving thousands of equations, we need a computer. There are special purpose programs such as LINPACK for this. Also popular are general purpose computer algebra systems including Maple, Mathematica, or MATLAB, and Sage.  For example, in the Topic on Networks, we need to solve this. $ $ i_0 - i_1 - i_2 = 0 i_1 - i_3 - i_5 = 0 i_2 - i_4 + i_5 = 0 i_3 + i_4 - i_6 = 0 5i_1 + 10i_3 = 10 2i_2 + 4i_4 = 10 5i_1 - 2i_2 + 50i_5 = 0 $ $ Doing this by hand would take time and be error-prone. A computer is better.  Here is that system solved with Sage. (There are many ways to do this; the one here has the advantage of simplicity.)  sage: var('i0,i1,i2,i3,i4,i5,i6') (i0, i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6) sage: network_system=[i0-i1-i2==0, i1-i3-i5==0, ....: i2-i4+i5==0, i3+i4-i6==0, 5*i1+10*i3==10, ....: 2*i2+4*i4==10, 5*i1-2*i2+50*i5==0] sage: solve(network_system, i0,i1,i2,i3,i4,i5,i6) [[i0 == (7/3), i1 == (2/3), i2 == (5/3), i3 == (2/3), i4 == (5/3), i5 == 0, i6 == (7/3)]]  Magic.  Here is the same system solved under Maple.

Use the computer to solve the two problems that opened this chapter.  This is the Statics problem. $ 40h+15c = 100 25c = 50+50h $ This is the Chemistry problem. $ 7h = 7j 8h +1i = 5j+2k 1i = 3j 3i = 6j+1k $     Sage does this.  sage: var('h,c') (h, c) sage: statics = [40*h + 15*c == 100, ....: 25*c == 50 + 50*h] sage: solve(statics, h,c) [[h == 1, c == 4]]  Other Computer Algebra Systems have similar commands. These Maple commands  > A:=array( [[40,15], [-50,25]] ); > u:=array([100,50]); > linsolve(A,u);  get the answer . Here there is a free variable.

Changes in one part can ripple out to affect other parts. Economists have struggled to be able to describe, and to make predictions about, such a complicated object. Mathematical models using systems of linear equations are a key tool. One example is Input-Output Analysis, pioneered by W.~Leontief, who won the 1973 Nobel Prize in Economics.  Consider an economy with many parts, two of which are the steel industry and the auto industry. These two interact tightly as they work to meet the demand for their product from other parts of the economy, from users external to the steel and auto sectors. For instance, should the external demand for autos go up, that would increase in the auto industry's usage of steel. Or should the external demand for steel fall, then it would lower steel's purchase of trucks. The model that we consider here takes in the external demands and predicts how the two interact to meet those demands.  We start with production and consumption statistics. (These numbers, giving dollar values in millions, are from describing the 1958 U.S. economy. Today's statistics would be different because of inflation and because of technical changes in the industries.)   \ {[b] used by [-.65ex] steel } {[b] used by [-.65ex] auto } {[b] used by [-.65ex] others } total  value of [-.65ex] steel $5395$2664$25448$ value of [-.65ex] auto $48$9030$30346$   For instance, the dollar value of steel used by the auto industry in this year is $2,664$ million. Note that industries may consume some of their own output.  We can fill in the external demands. This year's value of the steel used by others is $17,389$ and the external value of autos is $21,268$. With that we have a complete description of how auto and steel interact to meet their demands.  Now imagine that the external demand for steel has recently been going up by $200$ per year and so we estimate that next year it will be $17,589$. We also estimate that next year's external demand for autos will be down $25$ to $21,243$. We wish to predict next year's total outputs.  That prediction isn't as simple as adding $200$ to this year's steel total and subtracting $25$ from this year's auto total. For one thing, a rise in steel will cause that industry to have an increased demand for autos, which will mitigate the loss in external demand for autos. On the other hand, the drop in external demand for autos will cause the auto industry to use less steel and so lessen somewhat the upswing in steel's business. In short, these two industries form a system. We must predict where the system as a whole will settle.  Here are the equations. $ next year's production of steel =next year's use of steel by steel [-.8ex] +next year's use of steel by auto [-.8ex] +next year's use of steel by others next year's production of autos =next year's use of autos by steel [-.8ex] +next year's use of autos by auto [-.8ex] +next year's use of autos by others $ For the left side let $s$ be next years total production of steel and let $a$ be next year's total output of autos. For the right side, as discussed above, our external demand estimates are $17,589$ and $21,243$.  For next year's use of steel by steel, note that this year the steel industry used $5,395$ units of steel input to produce $25,448$ units of steel output. So next year, when the steel industry will produce $s$ units out, we guess that doing so will take $s· (5395)/(25448)$ units of steel input- this is simply the assumption that input is proportional to output. (We are assuming that the ratio of input to output remains constant over time; in practice, models may try to take account of trends of change in the ratios.)  Next year's use of steel by the auto industry is similar. This year the auto industry uses $2,664$ units of steel input to produce $30,346$ units of auto output. So next year, when the auto industry's total output is $a$, we expect it to consume $a· (2664)/(30346)$ units of steel.  Filling in the other equation in the same way gives this system of linear equations. $ $ (5395/25448)· s + (2664/30346)· a + 17589 = s (48/25448)· s + (9030/30346)· a + 21243 = a $ $ Moving the variables to one side and the constants to the other $ $ (20053/25448)s - (2664/30346)a = 17589 -(48/25448)s + (21316/30346)a = 21243 $ $ and applying Gauss's Method or using Sage, as here  sage: var('a,s') (a, s) sage: eqns=[(20053/25448)*s - (2664/30346)*a == 17589, ....: (-48/25448)*s + (21316/30346)*a == 21243] sage: solve(eqns, s, a) [[s == (2745320544312/106830469), a == (6476293881123/213660938)]] sage: n(2745320544312/106830469) 25697.9171767186 sage: n(6476293881123/213660938) 30311.0804517904  gives our prediction: $s=25,698$ and $a=30,311$.  Above, we discussed that the prediction of next year's totals isn't as simple as adding $200$ to last year's steel total and subtracting $25$ from last year's auto total. Comparing these predictions to the numbers for the current year shows that the total production of the steel industry should rise by~$250$ while auto's total drops by $35$. The increase in external demand for steel causes an increase in internal demand by the steel industry, which is lessened somewhat by the drop in autos, but results in a total that is more than $200$ higher. Similarly, auto's total drops more than~$25$ despite the help that it gets from steel.  One of the advantages of having a mathematical model is that we can ask ``What if ...?'' questions. For instance, we can ask, ``What if our estimates for next year's external demands are somewhat off?'' To try to understand how much the model's predictions change in reaction to changes in our estimates, we can revise the estimate of next year's external steel demand from $17,589$ down to $17,489$, while keeping the assumption of next year's external demand for autos fixed at $21,243$. The resulting system $ $ (20053/25448)s - (2664/30346)a = 17489 -(48/25448)s + (21316/30346)a = 21243 $ $ gives $s=25,571$ and $a=30,311$.           This is sensitivity analysis. We are seeing how sensitive the predictions of our model are to the accuracy of the assumptions.  Naturally, we can consider larger models that detail the interactions among more sectors of an economy; these models are typically solved on a computer. Naturally also, a single model does not suit every case and assuring that the assumptions underlying a model are reasonable for a particular prediction requires the judgments of experts. With those caveats however, this model has proven in practice to be a useful and accurate tool for economic analysis. For further reading, try and .     With the steel-auto system given above, estimate next year's total productions in these cases.  Next year's external demands are up $200$ from this year for steel and are unchanged for autos. Next year's external demands are up $100$ for steel and are up $200$ for autos. Next year's external demands are up $200$ for steel and are up $200$ for autos.   These answers are from Octave.

Imagine that a new process for making autos reduces this ratio to $.0500$.  How will the predictions for next year's total productions change compared to the first example discussed above (i.e., taking next year's external demands to be $17,589$ for steel and $21,243$ for autos)? Predict next year's totals if, in addition, the external demand for autos rises to be $21,500$ because the new cars are cheaper.

Fill in the numbers for this year's external demands. Set up the linear system, leaving next year's external demands blank. Solve the system where we get next year's external demands by taking this year's external demands and inflating them $10$\ Do all three sectors increase their total business by $10$\ Do they all even increase at the same rate? Solve the system where we get next year's external demands by taking this year's external demands and reducing them $7$\ (The study from which these numbers come concluded that because of the closing of a local military facility, overall personal income in the area would fall $7$\ be a first guess at what would actually happen.)             Gauss's Method lends itself to computerization. The code below illustrates. It operates on an $N by N$ matrix named~, doing row combinations using the first row, then the second row, etc.  for(row=1; row<=n-1; row++){ for(row_below=row+1; row_below<=n; row_below++){ multiplier=a[row_below,row]/a[row,row]; for(col=row; col<=n; col++){ a[row_below,col]-=multiplier*a[row,col]; } } }  This is in the C~language. The  loop initializes at~$1$ and then iterates while is less than or equal to $n-1$, each time through incrementing by one with the operation. The other non-obvious language construct is that the in the innermost loop has the effect of .  While that code is a first take on mechanizing Gauss's Method, it is naive. For one thing, it assumes that the entry in the position is nonzero. So one way that it needs to be extended is to cover the case where finding a zero in that location leads to a row swap or to the conclusion that the matrix is singular.  We could add some statements to cover those cases but we will instead consider another way in which this code is naive. It is prone to pitfalls arising from the computer's reliance on floating point arithmetic.  For example, above we have seen that we must handle a singular system as a separate case. But systems that are nearly singular also require care. Consider this one (the extra digits are in the ninth significant place). $ $ x + 2y = 3 1.00000001x + 2y = 3.00000001 $  $ By eye we easily spot the solution $x=1$, $y=1$. A computer has more trouble. If it represents real numbers to eight significant places, called single precision , then it will represent the second equation internally as $1.0000000x+2y=3.0000000$, losing the digits in the ninth place. Instead of reporting the correct solution, this computer will think that the two equations are equal and it will report that the system is singular.  For some intuition about how the computer could come up with something that far off, consider this graph of the system.    We cannot tell the two lines apart; this system is nearly singular in the sense that the two lines are nearly the same line. This gives the system~($*$) the property that a small change in an equation can cause a large change in the solution. For instance, changing the $3.00000001$ to $3.00000003$ changes the intersection point from $(1,1)$ to $(3,0)$. The solution changes radically depending on the ninth digit, which explains why an eight-place computer has trouble. A problem that is very sensitive to inaccuracy or uncertainties in the input values is ill-conditioned.  The above example gives one way in which a system can be difficult to solve on a computer. It has the advantage that the picture of nearly-equal lines gives a memorable insight into one way for numerical difficulties to happen. Unfortunately this insight isn't useful when we wish to solve some large system. We typically will not understand the geometry of an arbitrary large system.  There are other ways that a computer's results may be unreliable, besides that the angle between some of the linear surfaces is small. For example, consider this system (from ). $ $ 0.001x + y = 1 x - y = 0 $ $ The second equation gives $x=y$, so $x=y=1/1.001$ and thus both variables have values that are just less than $1$. A computer using two digits represents the system internally in this way (we will do this example in two-digit floating point arithmetic for clarity but inventing a similar one with eight or more digits is easy). $ $ (1.0× 10^{-3})· x + (1.0× 10^{0})· y = 1.0× 10^{0} (1.0× 10^{0})· x - (1.0× 10^{0})· y = 0.0× 10^{0} $ $ The row reduction step $-1000ρ_1+ρ_2$ produces a second equation $-1001y=-1000$, which this computer rounds to two places as $(-1.0× 10^{3})y=-1.0× 10^{3}$. The computer decides from the second equation that $y=1$ and with that it concludes from the first equation that $x=0$. The~$y$ value is close but the~$x$ is bad- the ratio of the actual answer to the computer's answer is infinite. In short, another cause of unreliable output is the computer's reliance on floating point arithmetic when the system-solving code leads to using leading entries that are small.  An experienced programmer may respond by using double precision, which retains sixteen significant digits, or perhaps using some even larger size. This will indeed solve many problems. However, double precision has greater memory requirements and besides we can obviously tweak the above to give the same trouble in the seventeenth digit, so double precision isn't a panacea. We need a strategy to minimize numerical trouble as well as some guidance about how far we can trust the reported solutions.  A basic improvement on the naive code above is to not determine the factor to use for row combinations by simply taking the entry in the position, but rather to look at all of the entries in the column below the entry and take one that is likely to give reliable results because it is not too small. This is partial pivoting.   For example, to solve the troublesome system~($**$) above we start by looking at both equations for a best entry to use, and take the~$1$ in the second equation as more likely to give good results. The combination step of $-.001ρ_2+ρ_1$ gives a first equation of $1.001y=1$, which the computer will represent as $(1.0× 10^{0})y=1.0× 10^{0}$, leading to the conclusion that $y=1$ and, after back-substitution, that $x=1$, both of which are close to right. We can adapt the code from above to do this.  for(row=1; row<=n-1; row++){ /* find the largest entry in this column (in row max) */ max=row; for(row_below=row+1; row_below<=n; row_below++){ if (abs(a[row_below,row]) > abs(a[max,row])); max = row_below; } /* swap rows to move that best entry up */ for(col=row; col<=n; col++){ temp=a[row,col]; a[row,col]=a[max,col]; a[max,col]=temp; } /* proceed as before */ for(row_below=row+1; row_below<=n; row_below++){ multiplier=a[row_below,row]/a[row,row]; for(col=row; col<=n; col++){ a[row_below,col]-=multiplier*a[row,col]; } } }   A full analysis of the best way to implement Gauss's Method is beyond the scope of this book (see ), but the method recommended by most experts first finds the best entry among the candidates and then scales it to a number that is less likely to give trouble. This is scaled partial pivoting.  In addition to returning a result that is likely to be reliable, most well-done code will return a conditioning number  that describes the factor by which uncertainties in the input numbers could be magnified to become inaccuracies in the results returned (see ).  The lesson is that just because Gauss's Method always works in theory, and just because computer code correctly implements that method, doesn't mean that the answer is reliable. In practice, always use a package where experts have worked hard to counter what can go wrong.    Using two decimal places, add $253$ and $2/3$.  Scientific notation because is convenient for expressing the two-place restriction: $.25× 10^{2}+.67× 10^{0}=.25× 10^{2}$. Notice that the $2/3$ has no effect.   This intersect-the-lines problem contrasts with the example discussed above.    $ x + 2y = 3 3x - 2y = 1 $$  Illustrate that in this system some small change in the numbers will produce only a small change in the solution by changing the constant in the bottom equation to $1.008$ and solving. Compare it to the solution of the unchanged system.  The reduction $ for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x + 2y = 3 -8y = -7.992 $ $ gives $ (x,y)=(1.002,0.999) $. So for this system a small change in the constant produces only a small change in the solution.   Consider this system (). $ $ 0.0003x + 1.556y = 1.569 0.3454x - 2.346y = 1.018 $ $  Solve it. Solve it by rounding at each step to four digits.    The fully accurate solution is that $x=10$ and $y=0$. The four-digit reduction $ for step $-(.3454/.0003)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ .0003 1.556 1.569 0 1789 -1805 ]) $ gives the conclusion that $x=10460$ and~$y=-1.009$. Of course, this is wildly different than the correct answer.    Rounding inside the computer often has an effect on the result. Assume that your machine has eight significant digits.  Show that the machine will compute $(2/3)+((2/3)-(1/3))$ as unequal to $((2/3)+(2/3))-(1/3)$. Thus, computer arithmetic is not associative. Compare the computer's version of $(1/3)x+y=0$ and $(2/3)x+2y=0$. Is twice the first equation the same as the second?    For the first one, first, $(2/3)-(1/3)$ is $.66666667-.33333333=.33333334$ and so $(2/3)+((2/3)-(1/3))=.66666667+.33333334=1.0000000$.  For the other one, first $((2/3)+(2/3))=.66666667+.66666667=1.3333333$ and so $((2/3)+(2/3))-(1/3)=1.3333333-.33333333=.99999997$. The first equation is $.33333333· x+1.0000000· y=0$ while the second is $.66666667· x+2.0000000· y=0$.    Ill-conditioning is not only dependent on the matrix of coefficients. This example shows that it can arise from an interaction between the left and right sides of the system. Let $ε$ be a small real. $ $ 3x + 2y + z = 6 2x + 2ε y + 2ε z = 2+4ε x + 2ε y - ε z = 1+ε $ $  Solve the system by hand. Notice that the $ε$'s divide out only because there is an exact cancellation of the integer parts on the right side as well as on the left. Solve the system by hand, rounding to two decimal places, and with $ε=0.001$.       This calculation $ for step $-(2/3)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 3 2 1 6 0 -(4/3)+2ε -(2/3)+2ε -2+4ε 0 -(2/3)+2ε -(1/3)-ε -1+ε ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 3 2 1 6 0 -(4/3)+2ε -(2/3)+2ε -2+4ε 0 ε -2ε -ε ]) $ gives a third equation of $y-2z=-1$. Substituting into the second equation gives $((-10/3)+6ε)· z=(-10/3)+6ε$ so $z=1$ and thus $y=1$. With those, the first equation says that $x=1$.  As above, scientific notation is convenient to express the restriction on the numbe of digits.  The solution with two digits retained is $z=2.1$, $y=2.6$, and $x=-.43$. $ ([ .30× 10^{1} .20× 10^{1} .10× 10^{1} .60× 10^{1} .10× 10^{1} .20× 10^{-3} .20× 10^{-3} .20× 10^{1} .30× 10^{1} .20× 10^{-3} -.10× 10^{-3} .10× 10^{1} ]) $ for step $-(2/3)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ .30× 10^{1} .20× 10^{1} .10× 10^{1} .60× 10^{1} 0 -.13× 10^{1} -.67× 10^{0} -.20× 10^{1} 0 -.67× 10^{0} -.33× 10^{0} -.10× 10^{1} ]) for step $-(.67/1.3)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ .30× 10^{1} .20× 10^{1} .10× 10^{1} .60× 10^{1} 0 -.13× 10^{1} -.67× 10^{0} -.20× 10^{1} 0 0 .15× 10^{-2} .31× 10^{-2} ]) $ $                   The diagram below shows some of a car's electrical network. The battery is on the left, drawn as stacked line segments. The wires are lines, shown straight and with sharp right angles for neatness. Each light is a circle enclosing a loop.    The designer of such a network needs to answer questions such as: how much electricity flows when both the hi-beam headlights and the brake lights are on? We will use linear systems to analyze simple electrical networks.  For the analysis we need two facts about electricity and two facts about electrical networks.  The first fact is that a battery is like a pump, providing a force impelling the electricity to flow, if there is a path. We say that the battery provides a potential.   For instance, when the driver steps on the brake then the switch makes contact and so makes a circuit on the left side of the diagram, which includes the brake lights. Once the circuit exists, the battery's force creates a current flowing through that circuit, lighting the lights.  The second electrical fact is that in some kinds of network components the amount of flow is proportional to the force provided by the battery. That is, for each such component there is a number, it's resistance, such that the potential is equal to the flow times the resistance. Potential is measured in volts, the rate of flow is in amperes, and resistance to the flow is in ohms; these units are defined so that $volts=amperes·ohms$.  Components with this property, that the voltage-amperage response curve is a line through the origin, are resistors.   For example, if a resistor measures $2$~ohms then wiring it to a $12$~volt battery results in a flow of $6$~amperes. Conversely, if electrical current of $2$~amperes flows through that resistor then there must be a $4$~volt potential difference between it's ends. This is the voltage drop across the resistor. One way to think of the electrical circuits that we consider here is that the battery provides a voltage rise while the other components are voltage drops.  The facts that we need about networks are Kirchoff's Current Law, that for any point in a network the flow in equals the flow out and Kirchoff's Voltage Law, that around any circuit the total drop equals the total rise.    We start with the network below. It has a battery that provides the potential to flow and three resistors, shown as zig-zags. When components are wired one after another, as here, they are in series.    By Kirchoff's Voltage Law, because the voltage rise is $20$~volts, the total voltage drop must also be $20$~volts. Since the resistance from start to finish is $10$~ohms (the resistance of the wire connecting the components is negligible), the current is $(20/10)=2$~amperes. Now, by Kirchhoff's Current Law, there are $2$~amperes through each resistor. Therefore the voltage drops are: $4$~volts across the $2$~ohm resistor, $10$~volts across the $5$~ohm resistor, and $6$~volts across the $3$~ohm resistor.  The prior network is simple enough that we didn't use a linear system but the next one is more complicated. Here the resistors are in parallel.     We begin by labeling the branches as below. Let the current through the left branch of the parallel portion be $i_1$ and that through the right branch be $i_2$, and also let the current through the battery be $i_0$.   Note that we don't need to know the actual direction of flow- if current flows in the direction opposite to our arrow then we will get a negative number in the solution.    The Current Law, applied to the split point in the upper right, gives that $i_0=i_1+i_2$. Applied to the split point lower right it gives $i_1+i_2=i_0$. In the circuit that loops out of the top of the battery, down the left branch of the parallel portion, and back into the bottom of the battery, the voltage rise is $20$ while the voltage drop is $i_1· 12$, so the Voltage Law gives that $12i_1=20$. Similarly, the circuit from the battery to the right branch and back to the battery gives that $8i_2=20$. And, in the circuit that simply loops around in the left and right branches of the parallel portion (we arbitrarily take the direction of clockwise), there is a voltage rise of $0$ and a voltage drop of $8i_2-12i_1$ so $8i_2-12i_1=0$. begin(displaymath) $ i_0 - i_1 - i_2 = 0 -i_0 + i_1 + i_2 = 0 12i_1 = 20 8i_2 = 20 -12i_1 + 8i_2 = 0 $ end(displaymath) The solution is $i_0=25/6$, $i_1=5/3$, and $i_2=5/2$, all in amperes. (Incidentally, this illustrates that redundant equations can arise in practice.)  Kirchhoff's laws can establish the electrical properties of very complex networks. The next diagram shows five resistors, whose values are in ohms, wired in series-parallel.    This is a Wheatstone bridge (see ). To analyze it, we can place the arrows in this way.    Kirchhoff's Current Law, applied to the top node, the left node, the right node, and the bottom node gives these. $ i_0 = i_1+i_2 i_1 = i_3+i_5 i_2+i_5 = i_4 i_3+i_4 = i_0 $ Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, applied to the inside loop (the $i_0$ to~$i_1$ to~$i_3$ to~$i_0$ loop), the outside loop, and the upper loop not involving the battery, gives these. $ 5i_1+10i_3 = 10 2i_2+4i_4 = 10 5i_1+50i_5-2i_2 = 0 $ Those suffice to determine the solution $i_0=7/3$, $i_1=2/3$, $i_2=5/3$, $i_3=2/3$, $i_4=5/3$, and $i_5=0$.  We can understand many kinds of networks in this way. For instance, the exercises analyze some networks of streets.      Calculate the amperages in each part of each network.  This is a simple network.    Compare this one with the parallel case discussed above.    This is a reasonably complicated network.       The total resistance is $7$~ohms. With a $9$~volt potential, the flow will be $9/7$~amperes. Incidentally, the voltage drops will then be:~$27/7$~volts across the $3$~ohm resistor, and $18/7$~volts across each of the two $2$~ohm resistors. One way to do this network is to note that the $2$~ohm resistor on the left has a voltage drop of $9$~volts (and hence the flow through it is $9/2$~amperes), and the remaining portion on the right also has a voltage drop of $9$~volts, and so we can analyze it as in the prior item. We can also use linear systems.    Using the variables from the diagram we get a linear system $ $ i_0 - i_1 - i_2 = 0 i_1 + i_2 - i_3 = 0 2i_1 = 9 7i_2 = 9 $ $ which yields the unique solution $i_1=81/14$, $i_1=9/2$, $i_2=9/7$, and $i_3=81/14$.  Of course, the first and second paragraphs yield the same answer. Essentially, in the first paragraph we solved the linear system by a method less systematic than Gauss's Method, solving for some of the variables and then substituting.  Using these variables    one linear system that suffices to yield a unique solution is this. $ $ i_0 - i_1 - i_2 = 0 i_2 - i_3 - i_4 = 0 i_3 + i_4 - i_5 = 0 i_1 + i_5 - i_6 = 0 3i_1 = 9 3i_2 + 2i_4 + 2i_5 = 9 3i_2 + 9i_3 + 2i_5 = 9 $ $ (The last three equations come from the circuit involving $i_0$-$i_1$-$i_6$, the circuit involving $i_0$-$i_2$-$i_4$-$i_5$-$i_6$, and the circuit with $i_0$-$i_2$-$i_3$-$i_5$-$i_6$.) Octave gives $i_0=4.35616$, $i_1=3.00000$, $i_2=1.35616$, $i_3=0.24658$, $i_4=1.10959$, $i_5=1.35616$, $i_6=4.35616$.    In the first network that we analyzed, with the three resistors in series, we just added to get that they acted together like a single resistor of $10$~ohms. We can do a similar thing for parallel circuits. In the second circuit analyzed,    the electric current through the battery is $25/6$~amperes. Thus, the parallel portion is equivalent to a single resistor of $20/(25/6)=4.8$~ohms.  What is the equivalent resistance if we change the $12$~ohm resistor to $5$~ohms? What is the equivalent resistance if the two are each $8$~ohms? Find the formula for the equivalent resistance if the two resistors in parallel are $r_1$~ohms and $r_2$~ohms.     Using the variables from the earlier analysis, begin(displaymath) $ i_0 - i_1 - i_2 = 0 -i_0 + i_1 + i_2 = 0 5i_1 = 20 8i_2 = 20 -5i_1 + 8i_2 = 0 $ end(displaymath) The current flowing in each branch is then is $i_2=20/8=2.5$, $i_1=20/5=4$, and $i_0=13/2=6.5$, all in amperes. Thus the parallel portion is acting like a single resistor of size $20/(13/2)≈ 3.08$~ohms.  A similar analysis gives that is $i_2=i_1=20/8=2.5$ and $i_0=40/8=5$~ amperes. The equivalent resistance is $20/5=4$~ohms.  Another analysis like the prior ones gives is $i_2=20/r_2$, $i_1=20/r_1$, and $i_0=20(r_1+r_2)/(r_1r_2)$, all in amperes. So the parallel portion is acting like a single resistor of size $20/i_0=r_1r_2/(r_1+r_2)$~ohms. (This equation is often stated as:~the equivalent resistance~$r$ satisfies $1/r=(1/r_1)+(1/r_2)$.)                              A Wheatstone bridge is used to measure resistance.    Show that in this circuit if the current flowing through $r_g$ is zero then $r_4=r_2r_3/r_1$. (To operate the device, put the unknown resistance at $r_4$. At $r_g$ is a meter that shows the current. We vary the three resistances $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$- typically they each have a calibrated knob- until the current in the middle reads $0$. Then the equation gives the value of $r_4$.)  Kirchoff's Current Law, applied to the node where $r_1$, $r_2$, and~$r_g$ come together, and also applied to the node where $r_3$, $r_4$, and~$r_g$ come together gives these. $ $ i_1 - i_2 - i_g = 0 i_3 - i_4 + i_g = 0 $ $ Kirchoff's Voltage law, applied to the loop in the top right, and to the loop in the bottom right, gives these. $ $ i_3r_3 - i_gr_g - i_1r_1 = 0 i_4r_4 - i_2r_2 + i_gr_g = 0 $ $ Assuming that $i_g$ is zero gives that $i_1=i_2$, that $i_3=i_4$, that $i_1r_1=i_3r_3$, and that $i_2r_2=i_4r_4$. Then rearranging the last equality $ r_4=(i_2r_2/i_4)·(i_3r_3/i_1r_1) $ and cancelling the $i$'s gives the desired conclusion.        Consider this traffic circle.    This is the traffic volume, in units of cars per five minutes.   \ North Pier Main  into out of $100$75$ $150$150$ $25$50$      We can set up equations to model how the traffic flows.   Adapt Kirchhoff's Current Law to this circumstance. Is it a reasonable modeling assumption?  Label the three between-road arcs in the circle with a variable. Using the (adapted) Current Law, for each of the three in-out intersections state an equation describing the traffic flow at that node.  Solve that system.  Interpret your solution.  Restate the Voltage Law for this circumstance. How reasonable is it?     An adaptation is:~in any intersection the flow in equals the flow out. It does seem reasonable in this case, unless cars are stuck at an intersection for a long time.  We can label the flow in this way.    Because $50$ cars leave via Main while $25$~cars enter, $i_1-25=i_2$. Similarly Pier's in/out balance means that $i_2=i_3$ and North gives $i_3+25=i_1$. We have this system. $ $ i_1 - i_2 = 25 i_2 - i_3 = 0 -i_1 + i_3 = -25 $ $  The row operations $ρ_1+ρ_2$ and $rho_2+ρ_3$ lead to the conclusion that there are infinitely many solutions. With $i_3$ as the parameter, $ {[25+i_3 i_3 i_3] such that i_3 in ℝ} $ of course, since the problem is stated in number of cars, we might restrict $i_3$ to be a natural number.  If we picture an initially-empty circle with the given input/output behavior, we can superimpose a $z_3$-many cars circling endlessly to get a new solution.  A suitable restatement might be:~the number of cars entering the circle must equal the number of cars leaving. The reasonableness of this one is not as clear. Over the five minute time period we could find that a half dozen more cars entered than left, although the problem statement's into/out table does satisfy this property. In any event, it is of no help in getting a unique solution since for that we would need to know the number of cars circling endlessly.    This is a network of streets.    We can observe the hourly flow of cars into this network's entrances, and out of its exits.    east Winooski west Winooski Willow Jay Shelburne  into out of $80$30$ $50$5$ $65$70$ -- $55$ $40$75$      (Note that to reach Jay a car must enter the network via some other road first, which is why there is no `into Jay' entry in the table. Note also that over a long period of time, the total in must approximately equal the total out, which is why both rows add to $235$~cars.) Once inside the network, the traffic may flow in different ways, perhaps filling Willow and leaving Jay mostly empty, or perhaps flowing in some other way. Kirchhoff's Laws give the limits on that freedom.  Determine the restrictions on the flow inside this network of streets by setting up a variable for each block, establishing the equations, and solving them. Notice that some streets are one-way only. (Hint:~this will not yield a unique solution, since traffic can flow through this network in various ways; you should get at least one free variable.) Suppose that someone proposes construction for Winooski Avenue East between Willow and Jay, and traffic on that block will be reduced. What is the least amount of traffic flow that can we can allow on that block without disrupting the hourly flow into and out of the network?    Here is a variable for each unknown block; each known block has the flow shown.    We apply Kirchhoff's principle that the flow into the intersection of Willow and Shelburne must equal the flow out to get $i_1+25=i_2+125$. Doing the intersections from right to left and top to bottom gives these equations. $ $ i_1 - i_2 = 10 -i_1 + i_3 = 15 i_2 + i_4 = 5 -i_3 - i_4 + i_6 = -50 i_5 - i_7 = -10 -i_6 + i_7 = 30 $ $ The row operation $ρ_1+ρ_2$ followed by $ρ_2+ρ_3$ then $ρ_3+ρ_4$ and $ρ_4+ρ_5$ and finally $ρ_5+ρ_6$ result in this system. $ $ i_1 - i_2 = 10 -i_2 + i_3 = 25 i_3 + i_4 - i_5 = 30 -i_5 + i_6 = -20 -i_6 + i_7 = -30 0 = 0 $ $ Since the free variables are $i_4$ and $i_7$ we take them as parameters. $  i_6 = i_7-30 i_5 = i_6+20=(i_7-30)+20=i_7-10 i_3 = -i_4+i_5+30=-i_4+(i_7-10)+30=-i_4+i_7+20 i_2 = i_3-25=(-i_4+i_7+20)-25=-i_4+i_7-5 i_1 = i_2+10=(-i_4+i_7-5)+10=-i_4+i_7+5  $ Obviously $i_4$ and $i_7$ have to be positive, and in fact the first equation shows that $i_7$ must be at least $30$. If we start with $i_7$, then the $i_2$~equation shows that $0≤ i_4≤ i_7-5$. We cannot take $i_7$ to be zero or else $i_6$ will be negative (this would mean cars going the wrong way on the one-way street Jay). We can, however, take $i_7$ to be as small as $30$, and then there are many suitable $i_4$'s. For instance, the solution $ (i_1,i_2,i_3,i_4,i_5,i_6,i_7) = (35,25,50,0,20,0,30) $ results from choosing $i_4=0$.            The first chapter finished with a fair understanding of how Gauss's Method solves a linear system. It systematically takes linear combinations of the rows. Here we move to a general study of linear combinations.  We need a setting. At times in the first chapter we've combined vectors from $ ℝ^2$, at other times vectors from $ ℝ^3$, and at other times vectors from higher-dimensional spaces. So our first impulse might be to work in $ ℝ^n$, leaving $n$ unspecified. This would have the advantage that any of the results would hold for $ ℝ^2$ and for $ ℝ^3$ and for many other spaces, simultaneously.  But if having the results apply to many spaces at once is advantageous then sticking only to $ ℝ^n$'s is overly restrictive. We'd like our results to apply to combinations of row vectors, as in the final section of the first chapter. We've even seen some spaces that are not simply a collection of all of the same-sized column vectors or row vectors. For instance, we've seen a homogeneous system's solution set that is a plane inside of $ ℝ^3$. This set is a closed system in that a linear combination of these solutions is also a solution. But it does not contain all of the three-tall column vectors, only some of them.  We want the results about linear combinations to apply anywhere that linear combinations make sense. We shall call any such set a vector space. Our results, instead of being phrased as ``Whenever we have a collection in which we can sensibly take linear combinations ...'', will be stated ``In any vector space ...''  Such a statement describes at once what happens in many spaces. To understand the advantages of moving from studying a single space to studying a class of spaces, consider this analogy. Imagine that the government made laws one person at a time: ``Leslie Jones can't jay walk.'' That would be bad; statements have the virtue of economy when they apply to many cases at once. Or suppose that they said, ``Kim Ke must stop when passing an accident.'' Contrast that with, ``Any doctor must stop when passing an accident.'' More general statements, in some ways, are clearer.                We shall study structures with two operations, an addition and a scalar multiplication, that are subject to some simple conditions. We will reflect more on the conditions later but on first reading notice how reasonable they are. For instance, surely any operation that can be called an addition (e.g., column vector addition, row vector addition, or real number addition) will satisfy conditions (1) through~(5) below.    vspace*{1ex}      A vector space (over $ ℝ $) consists of a set $ V $ along with two operations `+' and `$ · $' subject to the conditions that for all vectors $ vec(v),vec(w),vec(u) in V $ and all scalars $ r,s in ℝ $:  begin(compactenum) the set $V$ is closed under vector addition, that is, $ vec(v)+vec(w) in V $ vector addition is commutative, $ vec(v)+vec(w)=vec(w)+vec(v) $ vector addition is associative, $ (vec(v)+vec(w))+vec(u)=vec(v)+(vec(w)+vec(u)) $ there is a zero vector $ 0 in V $ such that $ vec(v)+0=vec(v) $ for all $ vec(v) in V $ each $ vec(v) in V $ has an additive inverse $ vec(w) in V $ such that $ vec(w)+vec(v)=0 $ the set $V$ is closed under scalar multiplication, that is, $ r·vec(v) in V $ addition of scalars distributes over scalar multiplication, $ (r+s)·vec(v)=r·vec(v)+s·vec(v) $ scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition, $ r·(vec(v)+vec(w))=r·vec(v)+r·vec(w) $ ordinary multipication of scalars associates with scalar multiplication, $ (rs)·vec(v) =r·(s·vec(v)) $ multiplication by the scalar~$1$ is the identity operation, $ 1·vec(v)=vec(v) $. end(compactenum)     vspace(-4.5ex)  The definition involves two kinds of addition and two kinds of multiplication, and so may at first seem confused. For instance, in condition~(7) the `$+$' on the left is addition of two real numbers while the `$+$' on the right is addition of two vectors in $ V $. These expressions aren't ambiguous because of context; for example, $ r $ and $ s $ are real numbers so `$ r+s $' can only mean real number addition. In the same way, item~(9)'s left side `$rs$' is ordinary real number multiplication, while its right side `$s·vec(v)$' is the scalar multipliction defined for this vector space.   vspace(-0.5ex) The best way to understand the definition is to go through the examples below and for each, check all ten conditions. The first example includes that check, written out at length. Use it as a model for the others. Especially important are the closure conditions, (1) and~(6). They specify that the addition and scalar multiplication operations are always sensible- they are defined for every pair of vectors and every scalar and vector, and the result of the operation is a member of the set (see ).  For example The set $ ℝ^2 $ is a vector space if the operations `$ + $' and `$ · $' have their usual meaning. $ [x_1 x_2] + [y_1 y_2] = [x_1+y_1 x_2+y_2]  r· [x_1 x_2] = [rx_1 rx_2] $ We shall check all of the conditions.  There are five conditions in the paragraph having to do with addition. For (1), closure of addition, observe that for any $ v_1,v_2,w_1,w_2 in ℝ $ the result of the vector sum $ [v_1 v_2] +[w_1 w_2] =[v_1+w_1 v_2+w_2] $ is a column array with two real entries, and so is in $ ℝ^2 $. For (2), that addition of vectors commutes, take all entries to be real numbers and compute $ [v_1 v_2] +[w_1 w_2] =[v_1+w_1 v_2+w_2] =[w_1+v_1 w_2+v_2] =[w_1 w_2] +[v_1 v_2] $ (the second equality follows from the fact that the components of the vectors are real numbers, and the addition of real numbers is commutative). Condition~(3), associativity of vector addition, is similar. $ ([v_1 v_2] +[w_1 w_2]) +[u_1 u_2] =[(v_1+w_1)+u_1 (v_2+w_2)+u_2] =[v_1+(w_1+u_1) v_2+(w_2+u_2)] =[v_1 v_2] +([w_1 w_2] +[u_1 u_2]) $ For the fourth condition we must produce a zero element- the vector of zeroes is it. $ [v_1 v_2] +[0 0] =[v_1 v_2] $ For (5), to produce an additive inverse, note that for any $v_1,v_2 in ℝ$ we have $ [-v_1 -v_2] +[v_1 v_2] =[0 0] $ so the first vector is the desired additive inverse of the second.  The checks for the five conditions having to do with scalar multiplication are similar. For (6), closure under scalar multiplication, where $r, v_1, v_2 in ℝ$, $ r·[v_1 v_2] =[rv_1 rv_2] $ is a column array with two real entries, and so is in $ ℝ^2 $. Next, this checks (7). $ (r+s)·[v_1 v_2] =[(r+s)v_1 (r+s)v_2] =[rv_1+sv_1 rv_2+sv_2] =r·[v_1 v_2]+s·[v_1 v_2] $ For (8), that scalar multiplication distributes from the left over vector addition, we have this. $ r·([v_1 v_2]+[w_1 w_2]) =[r(v_1+w_1) r(v_2+w_2)] =[rv_1+rw_1 rv_2+rw_2] =r·[v_1 v_2]+r·[w_1 w_2] $ The ninth $ (rs)·[v_1 v_2] =[(rs)v_1 (rs)v_2] =[r(sv_1) r(sv_2)] =r·(s·[v_1 v_2]) $ and tenth conditions are also straightforward. $ 1·[v_1 v_2] =[1v_1 1v_2] =[v_1 v_2] $   In a similar way, each $ ℝ^n $ is a vector space with the usual operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. (In $ ℝ^1 $, we usually do not write the members as column vectors, i.e., we usually do not write `$ (π) $'. Instead we just write `$ π $'.)  For example This subset of $ ℝ^3 $ that is a plane through the origin $ P={ [x y z] such that x+y+z=0} $ is a vector space if `+' and `$·$' are interpreted in this way. $ [x_1 y_1 z_1] + [x_2 y_2 z_2] = [x_1+x_2 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2]  r· [x y z] = [rx ry rz] $ The addition and scalar multiplication operations here are just the ones of $ ℝ^3 $, reused on its subset $P$. We say that $ P $ inherits these operations from $ ℝ^3 $. This example of an addition in $P$ $ [1 1 -2]+[-1 0 1]=[0 1 -1] $ illustrates that $P$ is closed under addition. We've added two vectors from $P$- that is, with the property that the sum of their three entries is zero- and the result is a vector also in $P$. Of course, this example is not a proof. For the proof that $P$ is closed under addition, take two elements of $P$. $ [x_1 y_1 z_1] [x_2 y_2 z_2] $ Membership in $P$ means that $x_1+y_1+z_1=0$ and $x_2+y_2+z_2=0$. Observe that their sum $ [x_1+x_2 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2] $ is also in $P$ since its entries add $(x_1+x_2)+(y_1+y_2)+(z_1+z_2)=(x_1+y_1+z_1)+(x_2+y_2+z_2)$ to $0$. To show that $ P $ is closed under scalar multiplication, start with a vector from $P$ $ [x y z] $ where $ x+y+z=0 $, and then for $ r in ℝ $ observe that the scalar multiple $ r·[x y z] = [rx ry rz] $ gives $ rx+ry+rz=r(x+y+z)=0 $. Thus the two closure conditions are satisfied. Verification of the other conditions in the definition of a vector space are just as straightforward.   For example shows that the set of all two-tall vectors with real entries is a vector space. gives a subset of an $ ℝ^n$ that is also a vector space. In contrast with those two, consider the set of two-tall columns with entries that are integers (under the usual operations of component-wise addition and scalar multiplication). This is a subset of a vector space but it is not itself a vector space. The reason is that this set is not closed under scalar multiplication, that is, it does not satisfy condition~(6). Here is a column with integer entries and a scalar such that the outcome of the operation $ 0.5 · [4 3] = [2 1.5] $ is not a member of the set, since its entries are not all integers.   For example The singleton set $ \{ [0 0 0 0] \} $ is a vector space under the operations $ [0 0 0 0] + [0 0 0 0] = [0 0 0 0]  r· [0 0 0 0] = [0 0 0 0] $ that it inherits from $ ℝ^4 $.   A vector space must have at least one element, its zero vector. Thus a one-element vector space is the smallest possible.    A one-element vector space is a trivial  space.    The examples so far involve sets of column vectors with the usual operations. But vector spaces need not be collections of column vectors, or even of row vectors. Below are some other types of vector spaces. The term `vector space' does not mean `collection of columns of reals'. It means something more like `collection in which any linear combination is sensible'.  For example Consider $ polyspace(_3)={a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 such that a_0,...,a_3 in ℝ} $, the set of polynomials of degree three or less (in this book, we'll take constant polynomials, including the zero polynomial, to be of degree zero). It is a vector space under the operations $ (a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3)+(b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+b_3x^3) =(a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+(a_2+b_2)x^2+(a_3+b_3)x^3 $ and $ r·(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3)= (ra_0)+(ra_1)x+(ra_2)x^2+(ra_3)x^3 $ (the verification is easy). This vector space is worthy of attention because these are the polynomial operations familiar from high school algebra. For instance, $ 3·(1-2x+3x^2-4x^3)-2·(2-3x+x^2-(1/2)x^3)=-1+7x^2-11x^3$.  Although this space is not a subset of any $ ℝ^n $, there is a sense in which we can think of $polyspace(_3)$ as ``the same'' as $ ℝ^4 $. If we identify these two space's elements in this way $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 corresponds to [a_0 a_1 a_2 a_3] $ then the operations also correspond. Here is an example of corresponding additions. $ {lr $1-2x+0x^2+1x^3$ + $2+3x+7x^2-4x^3$ $3+1x+7x^2-3x^3$ } corresponds to [1 -2 0 1] + [2 3 7 -4] = [3 1 7 -3] $ Things we are thinking of as ``the same'' add to ``the same'' sum. Chapter Three makes precise this idea of vector space correspondence. For now we shall just leave it as an intuition.   For example The set $ matspace(_){N by M} $ of $ N by M $ matrices with real number entries is a vector space under the natural entry-by-entry operations. $ ([ a b c d ]) + ([ w x y z ]) = ([ a+w b+x c+y d+z ])  r· ([ a b c d ]) = ([ ra rb rc rd ]) $ As in the prior example, we can think of this space as ``the same'' as $ ℝ^4 $.   For example The set $ {f such that map{{f}{{ ℕ}{{ ℝ} } $ of all real-valued functions of one natural number variable is a vector space under the operations $ (f_1+f_2)(n)=f_1(n)+f_2(n)  (r· f)(n)=rf(n) $ so that if, for example, $ f_1(n)=n^2+2sin(n) $ and $ f_2(n)=-sin(n)+0.5 $ then $ (f_1+2f_2)(n)=n^2+1 $.  We can view this space as a generalization of - instead of $2$-tall vectors, these functions are like infinitely-tall vectors. $ text{  $ n $ f(n)=n^2+1 $ $ 0 $ 1 $ $ 1 $ 2 $ $ 2 $ 5 $ $3$10$ $ ... $ ... $ } corresponds to colvec[r]{ 1 2 5 10 ... } $ Addition and scalar multiplication are component-wise, as in . (We can formalize ``infinitely-tall'' by saying that it means an infinite sequence, or that it means a function from $ ℕ$ to $ ℝ$.)   For example The set of polynomials with real coefficients $ { a_0+a_1x+·s+a_nx^n such that n in ℕ and a_0,...,a_n in ℝ} $ makes a vector space when given the natural `$+$' $ (a_0+a_1x+·s+a_nx^n)+(b_0+b_1x+·s+b_nx^n) =(a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+·s +(a_n+b_n)x^n $ and `$·$'. $ r· (a_0+a_1x+... a_nx^n) = (ra_0)+(ra_1)x+... (ra_n)x^n $ This space differs from the space $polyspace(_3)$ of . This space contains not just degree~three polynomials, but degree~thirty polynomials and degree three~hundred polynomials, too. Each individual polynomial of course is of a finite degree, but the set has no single bound on the degree of all of its members.  We can think of this example, like the prior one, in terms of infinite-tuples. For instance, we can think of $ 1+3x+5x^2 $ as corresponding to $ (1,3,5,0,0,...) $. However, this space differs from the one in . Here, each member of the set has a finite degree, that is, under the correspondence there is no element from this space matching $ (1,2,5,10,...) $. Vectors in this space correspond to infinite-tuples that end in zeroes.   For example The set $ {f such that map{{f}{{ ℝ}{{ ℝ} } $ of all real-valued functions of one real variable is a vector space under these. $ (f_1+f_2)(x)=f_1(x)+f_2(x)  (r· f)(x)=rf(x) $ The difference between this and is the domain of the functions.   For example The set $ F=\{ acos(θ+b)sin(θ) such that a,b in ℝ\} $ of real-valued functions of the real variable $ θ $ is a vector space under the operations  $ (a_1cos(θ+b_1)sin(θ))+(a_2cos(θ+b_2)sin(θ)) =(a_1+a_2)cos(θ+)(b_1+b_2)sin(θ) $ and $ r· (acos(θ+b)sin(θ)) =(ra)cos(θ+)(rb)sin(θ) $ inherited from the space in the prior example. (We can think of $ F $ as ``the same'' as $ ℝ^2 $ in that $acos(θ+b)sin(θ)$ corresponds to the vector with components $a$ and $b$.)   For example The set $ {map{{f}{{ ℝ}{{ ℝ} such that dfrac{{d^2f}{{dx^2}+f=0} $ is a vector space under the, by now natural, interpretation. $ (f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)  (r· f)(x)=rf(x) $ In particular, notice that closure is a consequence $ (d^2(f+g)/dx^2)+(f+g) =((d^2f/dx^2)+f)+((d^2g/dx^2)+g) $ and $ (d^2(rf)/dx^2)+(rf) =r((d^2 f/dx^2)+f) $ of basic Calculus. This turns out to equal the space from the prior example- functions satisfying this differential equation have the form $acos(θ+b)sin(θ)$- but this description suggests an extension to solutions sets of other differential equations.   For example The set of solutions of a homogeneous linear system in $ n $ variables is a vector space under the operations inherited from $ ℝ^n $. For example, for closure under addition consider a typical equation in that system $c_1x_1+·s+c_nx_n=0$ and suppose that both these vectors $ vec(v)=[v_1 ... v_n]  vec(w)=[w_1 ... w_n] $ satisfy the equation. Then their sum $ vec(v)+vec(w) $ also satisfies that equation: $ c_1(v_1+w_1)+·s+c_n(v_n+w_n) =(c_1v_1+·s+c_nv_n)+(c_1w_1+·s+c_nw_n) =0 $. The checks of the other vector space conditions are just as routine.   We often omit the multiplication symbol `$ · $' between the scalar and the vector. We distinguish the multiplication in $ c_1v_1 $ from that in $ rvec(v) $ by context, since if both multiplicands are real numbers then it must be real-real multiplication while if one is a vector then it must be scalar-vector multiplication.  has brought us full circle since it is one of our motivating examples. Now, with some feel for the kinds of structures that satisfy the definition of a vector space, we can reflect on that definition. For example, why specify in the definition the condition that $ 1·vec(v)=vec(v) $ but not a condition that $ 0·vec(v)=0 $?  One answer is that this is just a definition- it gives the rules and you need to follow those rules to continue.  Another answer is perhaps more satisfying. People in this area have worked to develop the right balance of power and generality. This definition is shaped so that it contains the conditions needed to prove all of the interesting and important properties of spaces of linear combinations. As we proceed, we shall derive all of the properties natural to collections of linear combinations from the conditions given in the definition.  The next result is an example. We do not need to include these properties in the definition of vector space because they follow from the properties already listed there.    In any vector space $ V $, for any $ vec(v) in V $ and $ r in ℝ $, we have (1)~$ 0·vec(v)=0 $, (2)~$ (-1·vec(v))+vec(v)=0 $, and (3)~$ r·0=0 $.      For (1) note that $ vec(v)=(1+0)·vec(v)=vec(v)+(0·vec(v)) $. Add to both sides the additive inverse of $ vec(v) $, the vector $ vec(w) $ such that $ vec(w)+vec(v)=0 $. $ vec(w)+vec(v) =vec(w)+vec(v)+0·vec(v) 0 =0+0·vec(v) 0 =0·vec(v) $ Item~(2) is easy: $ (-1·vec(v))+vec(v)=(-1+1)·vec(v)=0·vec(v)=0 $. For (3), $ r·0 = r·(0·0) = (r· 0)·0 = 0 $ will do.    The second item shows that we can write the additive inverse of $ vec(v) $ as `$ -vec(v) $' without worrying about any confusion with $ (-1)·vec(v) $.   A recap: our study in Chapter One of Gaussian reduction led us to consider collections of linear combinations. So in this chapter we have defined a vector space to be a structure in which we can form such combinations,  subject to simple conditions on the addition and scalar multiplication operations. In a phrase:~vector spaces are the right context in which to study linearity.   From the fact that it forms a whole chapter, and especially because that chapter is the first one, a reader could suppose that our purpose in this book is the study of linear systems. The truth is that we will not so much use vector spaces in the study of linear systems as we instead have linear systems start us on the study of vector spaces. The wide variety of examples from this subsection shows that the study of vector spaces is interesting and important in its own right. Linear systems won't go away. But from now on our primary objects of study will be vector spaces.    Name the zero vector for each of these vector spaces.  The space of degree three polynomials under the natural operations. The space of $ N by M $ matrices. The space $ {map{{f}{{[0..1]}{{ ℝ} such that f{ is continuous} $. The space of real-valued functions of one natural number variable.    $ 0+0x+0x^2+0x^3 $ $ ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ The constant function $ f(x)=0 $ The constant function $ f(n)=0 $    Find the additive inverse, in the vector space, of the vector.  In $ polyspace(_3) $, the vector $ -3-2x+x^2 $. In the space $ N by N $, $ ([ 1 -1 0 3 ]). $ In $ {ae^x+be^{{-x} such that a,b in ℝ} $, the space of functions of the real variable $ x $ under the natural operations, the vector $ 3e^x-2e^{-x} $.    $ 3+2x-x^2 $ $ ([ -1 +1 0 -3 ]) $ $ -3e^x+2e^{-x} $    For each, list three elements and then show it is a vector space.  The set of linear polynomials $ polyspace(_1)={a_0+a_1x such that a_0,a_1 in ℝ} $ under the usual polynomial addition and scalar multiplication operations. The set of linear polynomials $ {a_0+a_1x such that a_0-2a_1=0} $, under the usual polynomial addition and scalar multiplication operations.  Hint. Use as a guide. Most of the ten conditions are just verifications.    Three elements are: $1+2x$, $2-1x$, and $x$. (Of course, many answers are possible.)  The verification is just like . We first do conditions $1$-$5$ from def:VecSpace, having to do with addition. For closure under addition, condition~(1), note that where $a+bx,c+dx inpolyspace(_1)$ we have that $(a+bx)+(c+dx)=(a+c)+(b+d)x$ is a linear polynomial with real coefficients and so is an element of $polyspace(_1)$. Condition~(2) is verified with: where $a+bx,c+dx inpolyspace(_1)$ then $(a+bx)+(c+dx)=(a+c)+(b+d)x$, while in the other order they are $(c+dx)+(a+bx)=(c+a)+(d+b)x$, and both $a+c=c+a$ and $b+d=d+b$ as these are real numbers. Condition~(3) is similar: suppose $a+bx,c+dx,e+fx inpolyspace$ then $((a+bx)+(c+dx))+(e+fx)=(a+c+e)+(b+d+f)x$ while $(a+bx)+((c+dx)+(e+fx))=(a+c+e)+(b+d+f)x$, and the two are equal (that is, real number addition is associative so $(a+c)+e=a+(c+e)$ and $(b+d)+f=b+(d+f)$). For condition~(4) observe that the linear polynomial $0+0x inpolyspace(_1)$ has the property that $(a+bx)+(0+0x)=a+bx$ and $(0+0x)+(a+bx)=a+bx$. For the last condition in this paragraph, condition~(5), note that for any $a+bx inpolyspace(_1)$ the additive inverse is $-a-bx inpolyspace(_1)$ since $(a+bx)+(-a-bx)=(-a-bx)+(a+bx)=0+0x$.  We next also check conditions~(6)-(10), involving scalar multiplication. For (6), the condition that the space be closed under scalar multiplication, suppose that $r$ is a real number and $a+bx$ is an element of $polyspace(_1)$, and then $r(a+bx)=(ra)+(rb)x$ is an element of $polyspace(_1)$ because it is a linear polynomial with real number coefficients. Condition~(7) holds because $(r+s)(a+bx)=r(a+bx)+s(a+bx)$ is true from the distributive property for real number multiplication. Condition~(8) is similar: $r((a+bx)+(c+dx))=r((a+c)+(b+d)x)=r(a+c)+r(b+d)x=(ra+rc)+(rb+rd)x =r(a+bx)+r(c+dx)$. For~(9) we have $(rs)(a+bx)=(rsa)+(rsb)x=r(sa+sbx)=r(s(a+bx))$. Finally, condition~(10) is $1(a+bx)=(1a)+(1b)x=a+bx$.  Call the set $P$. In the prior item in this exercise there was no restriction on the coefficients but here we are restricting attention to those linear polynomials where $a_0-2a_1=0$, that is, where the constant term minus twice the coefficient of the linear term is zero. Thus, three typical elements of $P$ are $2+1x$, $6+3x$, and $-4-2x$.  For condition~(1) we must show that if we add two linear polynomials that satisfy the restriction then we get a linear polynomial also satisfying the restriction: here that argument is that if $a+bx,c+dx in P$ then $(a+bx)+(c+dx)=(a+c)+(b+d)x$ is an element of $P$ because $(a+c)-2(b+d)=(a-2b)+(c-2d)=0+0=0$. We can verify condition~(2) with: where $a+bx,c+dx inpolyspace(_1)$ then $(a+bx)+(c+dx)=(a+c)+(b+d)x$, while in the other order they are $(c+dx)+(a+bx)=(c+a)+(d+b)x$, and both $a+c=c+a$ and $b+d=d+b$ as these are real numbers. (That is, this condition is not affected by the restriction and the verification is the same as the verification in the first item of this exercise). Condition~(3) is also not affected by the extra restriction: suppose that $a+bx,c+dx,e+fx inpolyspace$ then $((a+bx)+(c+dx))+(e+fx)=(a+c+e)+(b+d+f)x$ while $(a+bx)+((c+dx)+(e+fx))=(a+c+e)+(b+d+f)x$, and the two are equal. For condition~(4) observe that the linear polynomial satisfies the restriction $0+0x in P$ because its constant term minus twice the coefficient of its linear term is zero, and then the verification from the first item of this question applies: $0+0x inpolyspace(_1)$ has the property that $(a+bx)+(0+0x)=a+bx$ and $(0+0x)+(a+bx)=a+bx$. To check condition~(5), note that for any $a+bx in P$ the additive inverse is $-a-bx$ since it is an element of $P$ (because $a+bx in P$ we know that $a-2b=0$ and multiplying both sides by $-1$ gives that $-a+2b=0$), and as in the first item it acts as the additive inverse $(a+bx)+(-a-bx)=(-a-bx)+(a+bx)=0+0x$.  We must also check conditions~(6)-(10), those for scalar multiplication. For (6), the condition that the space be closed under scalar multiplication, suppose that $r$ is a real number and $a+bx in P$ (so that $a-2b=0$), then $r(a+bx)=(ra)+(rb)x$ is an element of $P$ because it is a linear polynomial with real number coefficients satisfying that $(ra)-2(rb)=r(a-2b)=0$. Condition~(7) holds for the same reason that it holds in the first item of this exercise, because $(r+s)(a+bx)=r(a+bx)+s(a+bx)$ is true from the distributive property for real number multiplication. Condition~(8) is also unchanged from the first item: $r((a+bx)+(c+dx))=r((a+c)+(b+d)x)=r(a+c)+r(b+d)x=(ra+rc)+(rb+rd)x =r(a+bx)+r(c+dx)$. So is~(9): $(rs)(a+bx)=(rsa)+(rsb)x=r(sa+sbx)=r(s(a+bx))$. Finally, so is condition~(10): $1(a+bx)=(1a)+(1b)x=a+bx$.    For each, list three elements and then show it is a vector space.  The set of $ N by N $ matrices with real entries under the usual matrix operations. The set of $ N by N $ matrices with real entries where the $2,1$ entry is zero, under the usual matrix operations.   Use as a guide. (Comment. Because many of the conditions are quite easy to check, sometimes a person can feel that they must have missed something. Keep in mind that easy to do, or routine, is different from not necessary to do.)   Here are three elements. $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]), ([ -1 -2 -3 -4 ]), ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) $  For~(1), the sum of $N by N$ real matrices is a $N by N$ real matrix. For~(2) we consider the sum of two matrices $ ([ a b c d ])+ ([ e f g h ]) = ([ a+e b+f c+g d+h ]) $ and apply commutativity of real number addition $ =([ e+a f+b g+c h+d ]) = ([ e f g h ]) + ([ a b c d ]) $ to verify that the addition of the matrices is commutative. The verification for condition~(3), associativity of matrix addition, is similar to the prior verification: $ ( ([ a b c d ]) +([ e f g h ]) ) + ([ i j k l ]) = ([ (a+e)+i (b+f)+j (c+g)+k (d+h)+l ]) $ while $ ([ a b c d ]) + ( ([ e f g h ]) + ([ i j k l ]) ) = ([ a+(e+i) b+(f+j) c+(g+k) d+(h+l) ]) $ and the two are the same entry-by-entry because real number addition is associative. For~(4), the zero element of this space is the $N by N$ matrix of zeroes. Condition~(5) holds because for any $N by N$ matrix~$A$ the additive inverse is the matrix whose entries are the negative of $A$'s, the matrix $-1· A$.  Condition~($6$) holds because a scalar multiple of a $N by N$ matrix is a $N by N$ matrix. For condition~(7) we have this. $ (r+s) ([ a b c d ]) = ([ (r+s)a (r+s)b (r+s)c (r+s)d ]) = ([ ra+sa rb+sb rc+sc rd+sd ]) = r ([ a b c d ]) + s ([ a b c d ]) $ Condition~(8) goes the same way. $ r ( ([ a b c d ]) + ([ e f g h ]) ) = r ([ a+e b+f c+g d+h ]) = ([ ra+re rb+rf rc+rg rd+rh ]) = r ([ a b c d ]) + r ([ e f g h ]) = r ( ([ a b c d ]) + ([ e f g h ]) ) $ For~(9) we have this. $ (rs) ([ a b c d ]) = ([ rsa rsb rsc rsd ]) = r ([ sa sb sc sd ]) = r( s ([ a b c d ]) ) $ Condition~(10) is just as easy. $ 1 ([ a b c d ]) = ([ 1· a 1· b 1· c 1· d ]) = ([ sa sb sc sd ]) $  This differs from the prior item in this exercise only in that we are restricting to the set $T$ of matrices with a zero in the second row and first column. Here are three elements of $T$. $ ([ 1 2 0 4 ]), ([ -1 -2 0 -4 ]), ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Some of the verifications for this item are the same as for the first item in this exercise, and below we'll just do the ones that are different.  For~(1), the sum of $N by N$ real matrices with a zero in the $2,1$ entry is also a $N by N$ real matrix with a zero in the $2,1$ entry. $ ([ a b 0 d ]) + ([ e f 0 h ]) ([ a+e b+f 0 d+h ]) $ The verification for condition~(2) given in the prior item works in this item also. The same holds for condition~(3). For~(4), note that the $N by N$ matrix of zeroes is an element of $T$. Condition~(5) holds because for any $N by N$ matrix~$A$ the additive inverse is the matrix $-1· A$ and so the additive inverse of a matrix with a zero in the $2,1$ entry is also a matrix with a zero in the $2,1$ entry.  Condition~$6$ holds because a scalar multiple of a $N by N$ matrix with a zero in the $2,1$ entry is a $N by N$ matrix with a zero in the $2,1$ entry. Condition~(7)'s verification is the same as in the prior item. So are condition~(8)'s, (9)'s, and~(10)'s.    For each, list three elements and then show it is a vector space.  The set of three-component row vectors with their usual operations. The set $ {[x y z w] in ℝ^4 such that x+y-z+w=0} $ under the operations inherited from $ ℝ^4$.       Three elements are $[1 2 3]$, $[2 1 3]$, and $[0 0 0]$.  We must check conditions (1)-(10) in def:VecSpace. Conditions (1)-(5) concern addition. For condition~(1) recall that the sum of two three-component row vectors $ [a b c] +[d e f] =[a+d b+e c+f] $ is also a three-component row vector (all of the letters $a,...,f$ represent real numbers). Verification of~(2) is routine $ [a b c] +[d e f] =[a+d b+e c+f] =[d+a e+b f+c] =[d e f] +[a b c] $ (the second equality holds because the three entries are real numbers and real number addition commutes). Condition~(3)'s verification is similar. $ ([a b c] +[d e f] ) +[g h i] =[(a+d)+g (b+e)+h (c+f)+i] =[a+(d+g) b+(e+h) c+(f+i)] =[a b c] +([d e f] +[g h i] ) $ For (4), observe that the three-component row vector $[0 0 0]$ is the additive identity: $[a b c]+[0 0 0]=[a b c]$. To verify condition~(5), assume we are given the element $[a b c]$ of the set and note that $[-a -b -c]$ is also in the set and has the desired property: $[a b c]+[-a -b -c]=[0 0 0]$.  Conditions (6)-(10) involve scalar multiplication. To verify~(6), that the space is closed under the scalar multiplication operation that was given, note that $r[a b c]=[ra rb rc]$ is a three-component row vector with real entries. For~(7) we compute. $ (r+s)[a b c]=[(r+s)a (r+s)b (r+s)c] =[ra+sa rb+sb rc+sc] =[ra rb rc]+[sa sb sc] =r[a b c]+s[a b c] $ Condition~(8) is very similar. $ r([a b c]+[d e f]) $ =r[a+d b+e c+f] =[r(a+d) r(b+e) r(c+f)] =[ra+rd rb+re rc+rf] =[ra rb rc]+[rd re rf] =r[a b c]+r[d e f] $ $ So is the computation for condition~(9). $ (rs)[a b c] =[rsa rsb rsc] =r[sa sb sc] =r(s[a b c]) $ Condition~(10) is just as routine $1[a b c] =[1· a 1· b 1· c] =[a b c]$.  Call the set $L$. Closure of addition, condition~(1), involves checking that if the summands are members of~$L$ then the sum $ [a b c d] +[e f g h] = [a+e b+f c+g d+h] $ is also a member of $ L $, which is true because it satisfies the criteria for membership in $L$: $ (a+e)+(b+f)-(c+g)+(d+h) =(a+b-c+d)+(e+f-g+h)=0+0 $. The verifications for conditions~(2), (3), and~(5) are similar to the ones in the first part of this exercise. For condition~(4) note that the vector of zeroes is a member of~$L$ because its first component plus its second, minus its third, and plus its fourth, totals to zero.  Condition~(6), closure of scalar multiplication, is similar: where the vector is an element of~$L$, $ r[a b c d] =[ra rb rc rd] $ is also an element of~$L$ because $ra+rb-rc+rd=r(a+b-c+d)=r· 0=0$. The verification for conditions~(7), (8), (9), and~(10) are as in the prior item of this exercise.    Show that each of these is not a vector space. (Hint. Check closure by listing two members of each set and trying some operations on them.)  Under the operations inherited from $ ℝ^3 $, this set $ {[x y z] in ℝ^3 such that x+y+z=1} $ Under the operations inherited from $ ℝ^3 $, this set $ {[x y z] in ℝ^3 such that x^2+y^2+z^2=1} $ Under the usual matrix operations, $ {([ a 1 b c ]) such that a,b,c in ℝ} $ Under the usual polynomial operations, $ {a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 such that a_0,a_1,a_2 in ℝ^+} $ where $ ℝ^+$ is the set of reals greater than zero Under the inherited operations, $ {[x y] in ℝ^2 such that $ x+3y=4 $ and $ 2x-y=3 $ and $ 6x+4y=10 $ } $   In each item the set is called $ Q $. For some items, there are other correct ways to show that $Q$ is not a vector space.  It is not closed under addition; it fails to meet condition~(1). $ [1 0 0], [0 1 0] in Q  [1 1 0] not in Q $ It is not closed under addition. $ [1 0 0], [0 1 0] in Q  [1 1 0] not in Q $ It is not closed under addition. $ ([ 0 1 0 0 ]),  ([ 1 1 0 0 ]) in Q  ([ 1 2 0 0 ]) not in Q $ It is not closed under scalar multiplication. $ 1+1x+1x^2 in Q  -1·(1+1x+1x^2) not in Q $ It is empty, violating condition~(4).    Define addition and scalar multiplication operations to make the complex numbers a vector space over $ ℝ $.  The usual operations $ (v_0+v_1i)+(w_0+w_1i)=(v_0+w_0)+(v_1+w_1)i $ and $ r(v_0+v_1i)=(rv_0)+(rv_1)i $ suffice. The check is easy.   Is the set of rational numbers a vector space over $ ℝ $ under the usual addition and scalar multiplication operations?  No, it is not closed under scalar multiplication since, e.g., $ π· (1) $ is not a rational number.   Show that the set of linear combinations of the variables $ x,y,z $ is a vector space under the natural addition and scalar multiplication operations.  The natural operations are $ (v_1x+v_2y+v_3z)+(w_1x+w_2y+w_3z)=(v_1+w_1)x+(v_2+w_2)y+(v_3+w_3)z $ and $ r·(v_1x+v_2y+v_3z)=(rv_1)x+(rv_2)y+(rv_3)z $. The check that this is a vector space is easy; use as a guide.   Prove that this is not a vector space: the set of two-tall column vectors with real entries subject to these operations. $ [x_1 y_1] +[x_2 y_2] =[x_1-x_2 y_1-y_2]  r·[x y] =[rx ry] $  The `$ + $' operation is not commutative (that is, condition~(2) is not met); producing two members of the set witnessing this assertion is easy.   Prove or disprove that $ ℝ^3 $ is a vector space under these operations.  $ [x_1 y_1 z_1] +[x_2 y_2 z_2] =[0 0 0] and r[x y z] =[rx ry rz] $ $ [x_1 y_1 z_1] +[x_2 y_2 z_2] =[0 0 0] and r[x y z] =[0 0 0] $    It is not a vector space. $ (1+1)·[1 0 0] ≠ [1 0 0] +[1 0 0] $ It is not a vector space. $ 1·[1 0 0] ≠[1 0 0] $    For each, decide if it is a vector space; the intended operations are the natural ones.  The diagonal $ N by N $ matrices $ {([ a 0 0 b ]) such that a,b in ℝ} $ This set of $ N by N $ matrices $ {([ x x+y x+y y ]) such that x,y in ℝ} $ This set $ {[x y z w] in ℝ^4 such that x+y+w=1} $ The set of functions $ {map{{f}{{ ℝ}{{ ℝ} such that df/dx+2f=0} $ The set of functions $ {map{{f}{{ ℝ}{{ ℝ} such that df/dx+2f=1} $   For each ``yes'' answer, you must give a check of all the conditions given in the definition of a vector space. For each ``no'' answer, give a specific example of the failure of one of the conditions.  Yes. Yes. No, this set is not closed under the natural addition operation. The vector of all $1/4$'s is a member of this set but when added to itself the result, the vector of all $1/2$'s, is a nonmember. Yes. No, $ f(x)=e^{-2x}+(1/2) $ is in the set but $ 2· f $ is not (that is, condition~(6) fails).    Prove or disprove that this is a vector space: the real-valued functions $ f $ of one real variable such that $ f(7)=0 $.  It is a vector space. Most conditions of the definition of vector space are routine; we here check only closure. For addition, $ (f_1+f_2)(7)=f_1(7)+f_2(7)=0+0=0 $. For scalar multiplication, $ (r· f)(7)=rf(7)=r0=0 $.   Show that the set $ ℝ^+ $ of positive reals is a vector space when we interpret `$ x+y $' to mean the product of $ x $ and $ y $ (so that $ 2+3 $ is $ 6 $), and we interpret `$ r· x $' as the $ r $-th power of $ x $.  We check def:VecSpace.  First, closure under `$ + $' holds because the product of two positive reals is a positive real. The second condition is satisfied because real multiplication commutes. Similarly, as real multiplication associates, the third checks. For the fourth condition, observe that multiplying a number by $ 1 in ℝ^+ $ won't change the number. Fifth, any positive real has a reciprocal that is a positive real.  The sixth, closure under `$ · $', holds because any power of a positive real is a positive real. The seventh condition is just the rule that $ v^{r+s} $ equals the product of $ v^r $ and $ v^s $. The eight condition says that $ (vw)^r=v^rw^r $. The ninth condition asserts that $ (v^r)^s=v^{rs} $. The final condition says that $ v^1=v $.   Is $ {(x,y) such that x,y in ℝ} $ a vector space under these operations?  $ (x_1,y_1)+(x_2,y_2)=(x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2) $ and $ r· (x,y)=(rx,y) $ $ (x_1,y_1)+(x_2,y_2)=(x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2) $ and $ r· (x,y)=(rx,0) $    No: $ 1·(0,1)+1·(0,1) ≠ (1+1)·(0,1) $. No; the same calculation as the prior answer shows a condition in the definition of a vector space that is violated. Another example of a violation of the conditions for a vector space is that $ 1· (0,1) ≠ (0,1) $.    Prove or disprove that this is a vector space: the set of polynomials of degree greater than or equal to two, along with the zero polynomial.  It is not a vector space since it is not closed under addition, as $ (x^2)+(1+x-x^2) $ is not in the set.   At this point ``the same'' is only an intuition, but nonetheless for each vector space identify the $ k $ for which the space is ``the same'' as $ ℝ^k $.  The $ N by M $ matrices under the usual operations The $ N by M $ matrices (under their usual operations) This set of $ N by N $ matrices $ {([ a 0 b c ]) such that a,b,c in ℝ} $ This set of $ N by N $ matrices $ {([ a 0 b c ]) such that a+b+c=0} $    $ 6 $ $ nm $ $ 3 $ To see that the answer is $ 2 $, rewrite it as $ {([ a 0 b -a-b ]) such that a,b in ℝ} $ so that there are two parameters.    Using $ vec(+) $ to represent vector addition and $ vec(·) $ for scalar multiplication, restate the definition of vector space.  { defplus{{vec(+)}} deftim{{vec(·)}} A vector space (over $ ℝ $) consists of a set $ V $ along with two operations `$ plus$' and `$ tim$' subject to these conditions. Where $ vec(v),vec(w) in V $, (1)~their vector sum $ vec(v)plusvec(w) $ is an element of $ V $. If $ vec(u),vec(v),vec(w) in V $ then (2)~$ vec(v)plusvec(w)=vec(w)plusvec(v) $ and (3)~$ (vec(v)plusvec(w))plusvec(u) =vec(v)plus(vec(w)plusvec(u)) $. (4)~There is a zero vector $ 0 in V $ such that $ vec(v)plus(0)=vec(v) $ for all $ vec(v) in V$. (5)~Each $ vec(v) in V $ has an additive inverse $ vec(w) in V $ such that $ vec(w)plusvec(v)=0 $. If $ r,s $ are scalars, that is, members of $ ℝ $), and $ vec(v),vec(w) in V $ then (6)~each scalar multiple $ r·vec(v) $ is in $ V $. If $ r,s in ℝ $ and $ vec(v),vec(w) in V $ then (7)~$ (r+ s)·vec(v)=r·vec(v)plus(s)·vec(v) $, and (8)~$ rtim(vec(v)+vec(w)) =rtimvec(v)+rtimvec(w) $, and (9)~$ (rs)timvec(v) =rtim(stimvec(v)) $, and (10)~$ 1timvec(v)=vec(v) $. }   Prove these.  For any $vec(v) in V$, if $vec(w) in V$ is an additive inverse of $vec(v)$, then $vec(v)$ is an additive inverse of $vec(w)$. So a vector is an additive inverse of any additive inverse of itself. Vector addition left-cancels:~if $ vec(v),vec(s),vec(t) in V $ then $ vec(v)+vec(s)=vec(v)+vec(t) $ implies that $ vec(s)=vec(t) $.    Let $ V $ be a vector space, let $ vec(v) in V $, and assume that $ vec(w) in V $ is an additive inverse of $vec(v)$ so that $ vec(w)+vec(v)=0 $. Because addition is commutative, $ 0=vec(w)+vec(v)=vec(v)+vec(w) $, so therefore $ vec(v) $ is also the additive inverse of $ vec(w) $. Let $ V $ be a vector space and suppose $ vec(v),vec(s),vec(t) in V $. The additive inverse of $ vec(v) $ is $ -vec(v) $ so $ vec(v)+vec(s)=vec(v)+vec(t) $ gives that $ -vec(v)+vec(v)+vec(s)=-vec(v)+vec(v)+vec(t) $, which says that $ 0+vec(s)=0+vec(t) $ and so $ vec(s)=vec(t) $.    The definition of vector spaces does not explicitly say that $ 0+vec(v)=vec(v) $ (it instead says that $ vec(v)+0=vec(v) $). Show that it must nonetheless hold in any vector space.  Addition is commutative, so in any vector space, for any vector $ vec(v) $ we have that $ vec(v)=vec(v)+0=0+vec(v) $.   Prove or disprove that this is a vector space: the set of all matrices, under the usual operations.  It is not a vector space since addition of two matrices of unequal sizes is not defined, and thus the set fails to satisfy the closure condition.   In a vector space every element has an additive inverse. Can some elements have two or more?  Each element of a vector space has one and only one additive inverse.  For, let $ V $ be a vector space and suppose that $ vec(v) in V $. If $ vec(w)_1,vec(w)_2 in V $ are both additive inverses of $ vec(v) $ then consider $ vec(w)_1+vec(v)+vec(w)_2 $. On the one hand, we have that it equals $vec(w)_1+(vec(v)+vec(w)_2)= vec(w)_1+0=vec(w)_1$. On the other hand we have that it equals $(vec(w)_1+vec(v))+vec(w)_2= 0+vec(w)_2=vec(w)_2$. Therefore, $vec(w)_1=vec(w)_2$.    Prove that every point, line, or plane thru the origin in $ ℝ^3 $ is a vector space under the inherited operations. What if it doesn't contain the origin?    Every such set has the form $ {r·vec{{v}+s·vec{{w} such that r,s in ℝ} $ where either or both of $ vec(v),vec(w) $ may be $ 0 $. With the inherited operations, closure of addition $ (r_1vec(v)+s_1vec(w))+(r_2vec(v)+s_2vec(w)) =(r_1+r_2)vec(v)+(s_1+s_2)vec(w) $ and scalar multiplication $ c(rvec(v)+svec(w))=(cr)vec(v)+(cs)vec(w) $ are easy. The other conditions are also routine. No such set can be a vector space under the inherited operations because it does not have a zero element.    Using the idea of a vector space we can easily reprove that the solution set of a homogeneous linear system has either one element or infinitely many elements. Assume that $ vec(v) in V $ is not $ 0 $.  Prove that $ r·vec(v)=0 $ if and only if $ r=0 $. Prove that $ r_1·vec(v)=r_2·vec(v) $ if and only if $ r_1=r_2 $. Prove that any nontrivial vector space is infinite. Use the fact that a nonempty solution set of a homogeneous linear system is a vector space to draw the conclusion.   Assume that $ vec(v) in V $ is not $ 0 $.  One direction of the if and only if is clear:~if $r=0$ then $r·vec(v)=0$. For the other way, let $ r $ be a nonzero scalar. If $ rvec(v)=0 $ then $ (1/r)· rvec(v)=(1/r)· 0 $ shows that $vec(v)=0$, contrary to the assumption. Where $ r_1,r_2 $ are scalars, $ r_1vec(v)=r_2vec(v) $ holds if and only if $ (r_1-r_2)vec(v)=0 $. By the prior item, then $ r_1-r_2=0 $. A nontrivial space has a vector $ vec(v) ≠0 $. Consider the set $ {k·vec{{v} such that k in ℝ} $. By the prior item this set is infinite. The solution set is either trivial, or nontrivial. In the second case, it is infinite.    Is this a vector space under the natural operations: the real-valued functions of one real variable that are differentiable?  Yes. A theorem of first semester calculus says that a sum of differentiable functions is differentiable and that $ (f+g)^prime=f^prime(+g)^prime$, and that a multiple of a differentiable function is differentiable and that $ (r· f)^prime=rf^prime$.   A vector space over the complex numbers   $ ℂ$ has the same definition as a vector space over the reals except that scalars are drawn from $ ℂ $ instead of from $ ℝ $. Show that each of these is a vector space over the complex numbers. (Recall how complex numbers add and multiply: $ (a_0+a_1i)+(b_0+b_1i)=(a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)i $ and $ (a_0+a_1i)(b_0+b_1i)=(a_0b_0-a_1b_1)+(a_0b_1+a_1b_0)i $.)  The set of degree~two polynomials with complex coefficients This set $ {([ 0 a b 0 ]) such that a,b in ℂ and a+b=0+0i } $   The check is routine. Note that `$ 1 $' is $ 1+0i $ and the zero elements are these.  $ (0+0i)+(0+0i)x+(0+0i)x^2 $ $ ([ 0+0i 0+0i 0+0i 0+0i ]) $    Name a property shared by all of the $ ℝ^n $'s but not listed as a requirement for a vector space.  Notably absent from the definition of a vector space is a distance measure.    Prove that for any four vectors $ vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_4 in V $ we can associate their sum in any way without changing the result. $ ((vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)+vec(v)_3)+vec(v)_4 =(vec(v)_1+(vec(v)_2+vec(v)_3))+vec(v)_4 =(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)+(vec(v)_3+vec(v)_4) =vec(v)_1+((vec(v)_2+vec(v)_3)+vec(v)_4) =vec(v)_1+(vec(v)_2+(vec(v)_3+vec(v)_4)) $ This allows us to write `$ vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2+vec(v)_3+vec(v)_4 $' without ambiguity. Prove that any two ways of associating a sum of any number of vectors give the same sum. (Hint. Use induction on the number of vectors.)    A small rearrangement does the trick. $ (vec(v)_1+(vec(v)_2+vec(v)_3))+vec(v)_4 =((vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)+vec(v)_3)+vec(v)_4 =(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)+(vec(v)_3+vec(v)_4) =vec(v)_1+(vec(v)_2+(vec(v)_3+vec(v)_4)) =vec(v)_1+((vec(v)_2+vec(v)_3)+vec(v)_4) $ Each equality above follows from the associativity of three vectors that is given as a condition in the definition of a vector space. For instance, the second `$=$' applies the rule $(vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2)+vec(w)_3=vec(w)_1+(vec(w)_2+vec(w)_3)$ by taking $vec(w)_1$ to be $vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2$, taking $vec(w)_2$ to be $vec(v)_3$, and taking $vec(w)_3$ to be $vec(v)_4$. The base case for induction is the three vector case. This case $ vec(v)_1+(vec(v)_2+vec(v)_3) =(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)+vec(v)_3 $ is one of the conditions in the definition of a vector space.  For the inductive step, assume that any two sums of three vectors, any two sums of four vectors, ..., any two sums of $k$ vectors are equal no matter how we parenthesize the sums. We will show that any sum of $ k+1 $ vectors equals this one $ ((·s((vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)+vec(v)_3)+·s)+vec(v)_k) +vec(v)_{k+1} $.  Any parenthesized sum has an outermost `$ + $'. Assume that it lies between $ vec(v)_m $ and $ vec(v)_{m+1} $ so the sum looks like this. $ (·svec(v)_1·svec(v)_m·s) +(·svec(v)_{m+1}·svec(v)_{k+1}·s) $ The second half involves fewer than $k+1$ additions, so by the inductive hypothesis we can re-parenthesize it so that it reads left to right from the inside out, and in particular, so that its outermost `$+$' occurs right before $vec(v)_{k+1}$. $ =(·svec(v)_1·svec(v)_m·s) +((·s(vec(v)_{m+1}+vec(v)_{m+2})+·s+vec(v)_{k}) +vec(v)_{k+1}) $ Apply the associativity of the sum of three things $ =((·s vec(v)_1·svec(v)_m·s) +(·s(vec(v)_{m+1}+vec(v)_{m+2})+·svec(v)_k)) +vec(v)_{k+1} $ and finish by applying the inductive hypothesis inside these outermost parenthesis.   gives a subset of $ ℝ^2$ that is not a vector space, under the obvious operations, because while it is closed under addition, it is not closed under scalar multiplication. Consider the set of vectors in the plane whose components have the same sign or are~$0$. Show that this set is closed under scalar multiplication but not addition.  Let $vec(v)$ be a member of $ ℝ^2$ with components $v_1$ and $v_2$. We can abbreviate the condition that both components have the same sign or are~$0$ by $v_1v_2≥ 0$.  To show the set is closed under scalar multiplication, observe that the components of $rvec(v)$ satisfy $(rv_1)(rv_2)=r^2(v_1v_2)$ and $r^2≥ 0$ so $r^2v_1v_2≥ 0$.  To show the set is not closed under addition we need only produce one example. The vector with components $-1$ and~$0$, when added to the vector with components $0$ and~$1$ makes a vector with mixed-sign components of $-1$ and~$1$.                                                                                                               One of the examples that led us to define vector spaces was the solution set of a homogeneous system. For instance, we saw in such a space that is a planar subset of $ ℝ^3$. There, the vector space $ ℝ^3$ contains inside it another vector space, the plane.    For any vector space, a subspace is a subset that is itself a vector space, under the inherited operations.    For example 's plane $ P={[x y z] such that x+y+z=0} $ is a subspace of $ ℝ^3 $. As required by the definition the plane's operations are inherited from the larger space, that is, vectors add in $P$ as they add in $ ℝ^3$ $ [x_1 y_1 z_1]+[x_2 y_2 z_2] =[x_1+x_2 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2] $ and scalar multiplication is also the same as in $ ℝ^3$. To show that $P$ is a subspace we need only note that it is a subset and then verify that it is a space. We have already checked in that $P$ satisfies the conditions in the definition of a vector space. For instance, for closure under addition we noted that if the summands satisfy that $x_1+y_1+z_1=0$ and $x_2+y_2+z_2=0$ then the sum satisfies that $(x_1+x_2)+(y_1+y_2)+(z_1+z_2)=(x_1+y_1+z_1)+(x_2+y_2+z_2)=0$.   For example The $ x $-axis in $ ℝ^2 $ is a subspace, where the addition and scalar multiplication operations are the inherited ones. $ [x_1 0] + [x_2 0] = [x_1+x_2 0]  r·[x 0] =[rx 0] $ As in the prior example, to verify directly from the definition that this is a subspace we simply that it is a subset and then check that it satisfies the conditions in definition of a vector space. For instance the two closure conditions are satisfied: adding two vectors with a second component of zero results in a vector with a second component of zero and multiplying a scalar times a vector with a second component of zero results in a vector with a second component of zero.   For example Another subspace of $ ℝ^2$ is its trivial subspace. $ {[0 0]} $    Any vector space has a trivial subspace $ {0} $. At the opposite extreme, any vector space has itself for a subspace. These two are the improper subspaces. Other subspaces are proper .   For example Vector spaces that are not $ ℝ^n$'s also have subspaces. The space of cubic polynomials $ {a+bx+cx^2+dx^3 such that a,b,c,d in ℝ} $ has a subspace comprised of all linear polynomials $ {m+nx such that m,n in ℝ} $.   For example Another example of a subspace that is not a subset of an $ ℝ^n$ followed the definition of a vector space. The space in of all real-valued functions of one real variable $ {f such that map{{f}{{ ℝ}{{ ℝ} } $ has the subspace in  of functions satisfying the restriction $(d^2f/dx^2)+f=0$.   For example The definition requires that the addition and scalar multiplication operations must be the ones inherited from the larger space. The set $ S={1} $ is a subset of $ ℝ^1 $. And, under the operations $1+1=1$ and $r· 1=1$ the set $S$ is a vector space, specifically, a trivial space. However, $S$ is not a subspace of $ ℝ^1 $ because those aren't the inherited operations, since of course $ ℝ^1 $ has $ 1+1=2 $.   For example Being vector spaces themselves, subspaces must satisfy the closure conditions. The set $ ℝ^+ $ is not a subspace of the vector space $ ℝ^1 $ because with the inherited operations it is not closed under scalar multiplication: if $ vec(v)=1 $ then $ -1·vec(v) not in ℝ^+ $.   The next result says that is prototypical. The only way that a subset can fail to be a subspace, if it is nonempty and uses the inherited operations, is if it isn't closed.    For a nonempty subset $ S $ of a vector space, under the inherited operations the following are equivalent statements.  $ S $ is a subspace of that vector space $ S $ is closed under linear combinations of pairs of vectors: for any vectors $ vec(s)_1,vec(s)_2 in S $ and scalars $ r_1,r_2 $ the vector $ r_1vec(s)_1+r_2vec(s)_2 $ is in $ S $ $ S $ is closed under linear combinations of any number of vectors: for any vectors $ vec(s)_1,...,vec(s)_n in S $ and scalars $ r_1, ...,r_n $ the vector $ r_1vec(s)_1+·s+r_nvec(s)_n $ is an element of $ S $.    Briefly, a subset is a subspace if and only if it is closed under linear combinations.    `The following are equivalent' means that each pair of statements are equivalent. $ (1)⇔(2)  (2)⇔(3)  (3)⇔(1) $ We will prove the equivalence by establishing that $ (1)⇒ (3)⇒ (2)⇒ (1)$. This strategy is suggested by the observation that the implications $ (1)⇒ (3) $ and $ (3)⇒ (2) $ are easy and so we need only argue that $ (2)⇒ (1) $.    Assume that $ S $ is a nonempty subset of a vector space $V$ that is $S$ closed under combinations of pairs of vectors. We will show that $S$ is a vector space by checking the conditions.  The vector space definition has five conditions on addition. First, for closure under addition, if $ vec(s)_1,vec(s)_2 in S $ then $ vec(s)_1+vec(s)_2 in S $, as it is a combination of a pair of vectors and we are assuming that~$ S $ is closed under those. Second, for any $ vec(s)_1,vec(s)_2 in S $, because addition is inherited from $ V $, the sum $ vec(s)_1+vec(s)_2 $ in $ S $ equals the sum $ vec(s)_1+vec(s)_2 $ in $ V $, and that equals the sum $ vec(s)_2+vec(s)_1 $ in $ V $ (because $V$ is a vector space, its addition is commutative), and that in turn equals the sum $ vec(s)_2+vec(s)_1 $ in $ S $. The argument for the third condition is similar to that for the second. For the fourth, consider the zero vector of $ V $ and note that closure of $S$ under linear combinations of pairs of vectors gives that $ 0·vec(s)+0·vec(s)=0 $ is an element of $ S$ (where $ vec(s) $ is any member of the nonempty set $ S $); checking that $ 0 $ acts under the inherited operations as the additive identity of $ S $ is easy. The fifth condition is satisfied because for any $ vec(s) in S $, closure under linear combinations of pairs of vectors shows that $ 0·0+(-1)·vec(s) $ is an element of~$ S $, and it is obviously the additive inverse of $ vec(s) $ under the inherited operations.   The verifications for the scalar multiplication conditions are similar; see .   We will usually verify that a subset is a subspace by checking that it satisfies statement~(2).   At the start of this chapter we introduced vector spaces as collections in which linear combinations ``make sense.''               's statements (1)-(3) say that we can always make sense of an expression like $r_1vec(s)_1+r_2vec(s)_2$ in that the vector described is in the set~$S$.  As a contrast, consider the set $T$ of two-tall vectors whose entries add to a number greater than or equal to zero. Here we cannot just write any linear combination such as $2vec(t)_1-3vec(t)_2$ and be confident the result is an element of $T$.   suggests that a good way to think of a vector space is as a collection of unrestricted linear combinations. The next two examples take some spaces and recasts their descriptions to be in that form.  For example We can show that this plane through the origin subset of $ ℝ^3$ $ S={[x y z] such that x-2y+z=0} $ is a subspace under the usual addition and scalar multiplication operations of column vectors by checking that it is nonempty and closed under linear combinations of two vectors. But there is another way. Think of $x-2y+z=0$ as a one-equation linear system and parametrize it by expressing the leading variable in terms of the free variables $x=2y-z$. $ S ={[2y-z y z] such that y,z in ℝ} ={y[2 1 0]+ z[-1 0 1] such that y,z in ℝ}  $ Now, to show that this is a subspace consider $r_1vec(s)_1+r_2vec(s)_2$. Each $vec(s)_i$ is a linear combination of the two vectors in ($*$) so this is a linear combination of linear combinations. $ r_1·(y_1[2 1 0]+ z_1[-1 0 1]) + r_2·(y_2[2 1 0]+ z_2[-1 0 1]) $ The Linear Combination Lemma, Lemma~One.III., shows that the total is a linear combination of the two vectors and so 's statement~(2) is satisfied.   For example This is a subspace of the $ N by N $ matrices $matspace(_){N by N}$. $ L={([ a 0 b c ]) such that a+b+c=0} $ To parametrize, express the condition as $a=-b-c$. $ L ={([ -b-c 0 b c ]) such that b,c in ℝ} ={b([ -1 0 1 0 ]) +c([ -1 0 0 1 ]) such that b,c in ℝ} $ As above, we've described the subspace as a collection of unrestricted linear combinations. To show it is a subspace, note that a linear combination of vectors from $L$ is a linear combination of linear combinations and so statement~(2) is true.        The span (or linear closure) of a nonempty subset $ S $ of a vector space is the set of all linear combinations of vectors from $ S $. $ span(S) =\{ c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n such that c_1,..., c_n in ℝ and vec(s)_1,...,vec(s)_n in S \} $ The span of the empty subset of a vector space is its trivial subspace.     No notation for the span is completely standard. The square brackets used here are common but so are `$span(S)$' and `$sp(S)$'.    In Chapter One, after we showed that we can write the solution set of a homogeneous linear system as ${c_1vec{{β}_1+·s+c_kvec{{β}_k such that c_1,...,c_k in ℝ}$, we described that as the set `generated' by the $smash{vec(β)}$'s. We now call that the span of ${vec{{β}_1,...,vec{{β}_k}$.  Recall also from that proof that the span of the empty set is defined to be the set $ {0} $ because of the convention that a trivial linear combination, a combination of zero-many vectors, adds to~$ 0 $. Besides, defining the empty set's span to be the trivial subspace is convenient because it keeps results like the next one from needing exceptions for the empty set.     In a vector space, the span of any subset is a subspace.      If the subset $ S $ is empty then by definition its span is the trivial subspace. If $ S$ is not empty then by we need only check that the span $ span(S) $ is closed under linear combinations of pairs of elements. For a pair of vectors from that span, $ vec(v)=c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n $ and $ vec(w)=c_{n+1}vec(s)_{n+1}+·s+c_mvec(s)_m $, a linear combination $ p·(c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n)+ r·(c_{n+1}vec(s)_{n+1}+·s+c_mvec(s)_m) = pc_1vec(s)_1+·s+pc_nvec(s)_n +rc_{n+1}vec(s)_{n+1}+·s+rc_mvec(s)_m $ is a linear combination of elements of~$ S $ and so is an element of $ span(S) $ (possibly some of the $vec(s)_i$'s from $vec(v)$ equal some of the $vec(s)_j$'s from $vec(w)$ but that does not matter).    The converse of the lemma holds: any subspace is the span of some set, because a subspace is obviously the span of itself, the set of all of its members. Thus a subset of a vector space is a subspace if and only if it is a span. This fits the intuition that a good way to think of a vector space is as a collection in which linear combinations are sensible.  Taken together, and show that the span of a subset $S$ of a vector space is the smallest subspace containing all of the members of $S$.  For example In any vector space $ V $, for any vector $ vec(v) in V $, the set $ {r·vec{{v} such that r in ℝ} $ is a subspace of $ V $. For instance, for any vector $ vec(v) in ℝ^3 $ the line through the origin containing that vector $ {kvec{{v} such that k in ℝ } $ is a subspace of $ ℝ^3 $. This is true even if $vec(v)$ is the zero vector, in which case it is the degenerate line, the trivial subspace.   For example The span of this set is all of $ ℝ^2$. $ {[1 1],[1 -1]} $ We know that the span is some subspace of~$ ℝ^2$. To check that it is all of~$ ℝ^2$ we must show that any member of $ ℝ^2$ is a linear combination of these two vectors. So we ask:~for which vectors with real components $x$ and~$y$ are there scalars $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that this holds? $ c_1[1 1]+c_2[1 -1]=[x y]  $ Gauss's Method $ $ c_1 + c_2 = x c_1 - c_2 = y $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ c_1 + c_2 = x -2c_2 = -x+y $ $ with back substitution gives $c_2=(x-y)/2$ and $c_1=(x+y)/2$. This shows that for any $x,y$ there are appropriate coefficients $c_1,c_2$ making~($*$) true- we can write any element of $ ℝ^2$ as a linear combination of the two given ones. For instance, for $x=1$ and $y=2$ the coefficients $c_2=-1/2$ and $c_1=3/2$ will do.   Since spans are subspaces, and we know that a good way to understand a subspace is to parametrize its description, we can try to understand a set's span in that way.  For example Consider, in the vector space of quadratic polynomials~$ polyspace(_2) $, the span of the set $ S={3x-x^2, 2x} $. By the definition of span, it is the set of unrestricted linear combinations of the two ${c_1(3x-x^2)+c_2(2x) such that c_1,c_2 in ℝ}$. Clearly polynomials in this span must have a constant term of zero. Is that necessary condition also sufficient?  We are asking:~for which members $a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$ of $polyspace(_2)$ are there $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0=c_1(3x-x^2)+c_2(2x)$? Polynomials are equal when their coefficients are equal so we want conditions on $a_2$, $a_1$, and $a_0$ making that triple a solution of this system. $ $ -c_1 = a_2 3c_1 + 2c_2 = a_1 0 = a_0 $ $ Gauss's Method and back-substitution gives $c_1=-a_2$, and $c_2=(3/2)a_2+(1/2)a_1$, and $0=a_0$. Thus   as long as there is no constant term $a_0=0$ we can give coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ to describe that polynomial as an element of the span. For instance, for the polynomial $0-4x+3x^2$, the coefficients $c_1=-3$ and $c_2=5/2$ will do. So the span of the given set is $span(S)={a_1x+a_2x^2 such that a_1,a_2 in ℝ}$.  Incidentally, this shows that the set $ {x,x^2} $ spans the same subspace. A space can have more than one spanning set. Two other sets spanning this subspace are $ {x,x^2,-x+2x^2} $ and $ {x,x+x^2,x+2x^2,...} $.     For example The picture below shows the subspaces of $ ℝ^3 $ that we now know of: the trivial subspace, lines through the origin, planes through the origin, and the whole space. (Of course, the picture shows only a few of the infinitely many cases. Line segments connect subsets with their supersets.) In the next section we will prove that $ ℝ^3$ has no other kind of subspace, so in fact this lists them all.  This describes each subspace as the span of a set with a minimal number of members. With this, the subspaces fall naturally into levels- planes on one level, lines on another, etc.  setlength(\unitlength){4pt} (0,-2) thinlines put(45,31){(0,0)[bl]{ $ {x[1 0 0] +y[0 1 0] +z[0 0 1]} $} }  put(43,31){ }  put(0,22){(0,0)[l]{$ {x[1 0 0] +y[0 1 0] }$ }} put(48,29){ }  put(20,22){(0,0)[l]{$ {x[1 0 0] +z[0 0 1] }$ }} put(53,29){}  put(40,22){(0,0)[l]{$ {x[1 1 0] +z[0 0 1] }$ }} put(60,22){(0,0)[l]{$·s$} }  put(7,18){ } put(22,18){ }  put(0,10){(0,0)[l]{$ {x[1 0 0]} $} } put(12,18){ }  put(12,10){(0,0)[l]{$ {y[0 1 0]} $} } put(14,18){ }  put(24,10){(0,0)[l]{$ {y[2 1 0]} $} } put(46,18){ }  put(36,10){(0,0)[l]{$ {y[1 1 1]} $} } put(48,10){(0,0)[l]{$·s$} }  put(9,7.5){ } put(18.9,7.7){ } put(30.4,6.8){ } put(41,6){ } put(45,0){(0,0){$ {[0 0 0] } $} }     So far in this chapter we have seen that to study the properties of linear combinations, the right setting is a collection that is closed under these combinations. In the first subsection we introduced such collections, vector spaces, and we saw a great variety of examples. In this subsection we saw still more spaces, ones that are subspaces of others. In all of the variety there is a commonality. above brings it out:~vector spaces and subspaces are best understood as a span, and especially as a span of a small number of vectors. The next section studies spanning sets that are minimal.        Which of these subsets of the vector space of $ N by N $ matrices are subspaces under the inherited operations? For each one that is a subspace, parametrize its description. For each that is not, give a condition that fails.  $ {([ a 0 0 b ]) such that a,b in ℝ} $ $ {([ a 0 0 b ]) such that a+b=0} $ $ {([ a 0 0 b ]) such that a+b=5} $ $ {([ a c 0 b ]) such that a+b=0, c in ℝ} $   By , to see if each subset of $matspace(_){N by N}$ is a subspace, we need only check if it is nonempty and closed.  Yes, we can easily check that it is nonempty and closed. This is a parametrization. $ {a([ 1 0 0 0 ]) +b([ 0 0 0 1 ]) such that a,b in ℝ} $ By the way, the parametrization also shows that it is a subspace, since it is given as the span of the two-matrix set, and any span is a subspace. Yes; it is easily checked to be nonempty and closed. Alternatively, as mentioned in the prior answer, the existence of a parametrization shows that it is a subspace. For the parametrization, the condition $a+b=0$ can be rewritten as $a=-b$. Then we have this. $ {([ -b 0 0 b ]) such that b in ℝ} ={b([ -1 0 0 1 ]) such that b in ℝ} $ No. It is not closed under addition. For instance, $ ([ 5 0 0 0 ]) +([ 5 0 0 0 ]) =([ 10 0 0 0 ]) $ is not in the set. (This set is also not closed under scalar multiplication, for instance, it does not contain the zero matrix.) Yes. $ {b([ -1 0 0 1 ]) +c([ 0 1 0 0 ]) such that b,c in ℝ} $    Is this a subspace of $ polyspace(_2) $: $ {a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 such that a_0+2a_1+a_2=4} $? If it is then parametrize its description.  No, it is not closed. In particular, it is not closed under scalar multiplication because it does not contain the zero polynomial.  Is the vector in the span of the set? $ [1 0 3]  {[2 1 -1], [1 -1 1]} $  The equation $ [1 0 3] = c_1[2 1 -1] +c_2[1 -1 1] $ gives rise to a linear system $ ([ 2 1 1 1 -1 0 -1 1 3 ]) for step $(-1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 2 1 1 0 -3/2 -1/2 0 0 3 ]) $ that has no solution, so the vector is not in the span.   Decide if the vector lies in the span of the set, inside of the space.  $ [2 0 1] $, $ {[1 0 0], [0 0 1] } $, in $ ℝ^3 $ $ x-x^3 $, $ {x^2,2x+x^2,x+x^3} $, in $ polyspace(_3) $ $ ([ 0 1 4 2 ]) $, $ {([ 1 0 1 1 ]), ([ 2 0 2 3 ]) } $, in $ matspace(_){N by N} $    Yes, solving the linear system arising from $ r_1[1 0 0]+r_2[0 0 1] =[2 0 1] $ gives $ r_1=2 $ and $ r_2=1 $. Yes; the linear system arising from $ r_1(x^2)+r_2(2x+x^2)+r_3(x+x^3)=x-x^3 $ $ $ 2r_2 + r_3 = 1 r_1 + r_2 = 0 r_3 = -1 $ $ gives that $ -1(x^2)+1(2x+x^2)-1(x+x^3)=x-x^3 $. No; any combination of the two given matrices has a zero in the upper right.    Which of these are members of the span $ span({cos^2(x),sin^2(x)) } $ in the vector space of real-valued functions of one real variable?  $ f(x)=1 $ $ f(x)=3+x^2 $ $ f(x)=sin(x) $ $ f(x)=cos(2x) $    Yes; it is in that span since $ 1·cos^2(x+1)·sin^2(x)=f(x) $. No, since $ r_1cos^2(x+r_2)sin^2(x)=3+x^2 $ has no scalar solutions that work for all $ x $. For instance, setting $x$ to be $0$ and $π$ gives the two equations $r_1· 1+r_2· 0=3$ and $r_1· 1+r_2· 0=3+π^2$, which are not consistent with each other. No; consider what happens on setting $x$ to be $π/2$ and $3π/2$. Yes, $ cos(2x)=1·cos(x)-1·sin(x) $.    Which of these sets spans $ ℝ^3 $? That is, which of these sets has the property that any three-tall vector can be expressed as a suitable linear combination of the set's elements?  $ { [1 0 0], [0 2 0], [0 0 3] } $ $ { [2 0 1], [1 1 0], [0 0 1] } $ $ { [1 1 0], [3 0 0] } $ $ { [1 0 1], [3 1 0], [-1 0 0], [2 1 5] } $ $ { [2 1 1], [3 0 1], [5 1 2], [6 0 2] } $    Yes, for any $ x,y,z in ℝ $ this equation $ r_1[1 0 0] +r_2[0 2 0] +r_3[0 0 3] =[x y z] $ has the solution $ r_1=x $, $ r_2=y/2 $, and $ r_3=z/3 $. Yes, the equation $ r_1[2 0 1] +r_2[1 1 0] +r_3[0 0 1] =[x y z] $ gives rise to this $ $ 2r_1 + r_2 = x r_2 = y r_1 + r_3 = z $ for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_3$repeat step $(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ 2r_1 + r_2 = x r_2 = y r_3 = -(1/2)x+(1/2)y+z $ $ so that, given any $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can compute that $ r_3=(-1/2)x+(1/2)y+z $, $ r_2=y $, and $ r_1=(1/2)x-(1/2)y $. No. In particular, we cannot get the vector $ [0 0 1] $ as a linear combination since the two given vectors both have a third component of zero. Yes. The equation $ r_1[1 0 1] +r_2[3 1 0] +r_3[-1 0 0] +r_4[2 1 5] =[x y z] $ leads to this reduction. $ ([ 1 3 -1 2 x 0 1 0 1 y 1 0 0 5 z ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_3$repeat step $3ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 3 -1 2 x 0 1 0 1 y 0 0 1 6 -x+3y+z ]) $ We have infinitely many solutions. We can, for example, set $r_4$ to be zero and solve for $r_3$, $r_2$, and $r_1$ in terms of $x$, $y$, and $z$ by the usual methods of back-substitution. No. The equation $ r_1[2 1 1] +r_2[3 0 1] +r_3[5 1 2] +r_4[6 0 2] =[x y z] $ leads to this reduction. $ ([ 2 3 5 6 x 1 0 1 0 y 1 1 2 2 z ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-(1/3)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 2 3 5 6 x 0 -3/2 -3/2 -3 -(1/2)x+y 0 0 0 0 -(1/3)x-(1/3)y+z ]) $ This shows that not every three-tall vector can be so expressed. Only the vectors satisfying the restriction that $-(1/3)x-(1/3)y+z=0$ are in the span. (To see that any such vector is indeed expressible, take $r_3$ and $r_4$ to be zero and solve for $r_1$ and $r_2$ in terms of $x$, $y$, and $z$ by back-substitution.)    Parametrize each subspace's description. Then express each subspace as a span.  The subset $ {[a b c] such that a-c=0} $ of the three-wide row vectors This subset of $ matspace(_){N by N} $ $ {([ a b c d ]) such that a+d=0} $ This subset of $ matspace(_){N by N} $ $ {([ a b c d ]) such that text{$ 2a-c-d=0 $ and $ a+3b=0 $} } $ The subset $ {a+bx+cx^3 such that a-2b+c=0} $ of $ polyspace(_3) $ The subset of $ polyspace(_2) $ of quadratic polynomials $ p $ such that $ p(7)=0 $    $ {[c b c] such that b,c in ℝ} ={b[0 1 0]+c[1 0 1] such that b,c in ℝ} $ The obvious choice for the set that spans is ${[0 1 0],[1 0 1]}$. $ {([ -d b c d ]) such that b,c,d in ℝ} ={b([ 0 1 0 0 ]) +c([ 0 0 1 0 ]) +d([ -1 0 0 1 ]) such that b,c,d in ℝ} $ One set that spans this space consists of those three matrices. The system $ $ a + 3b = 0 2a -c - d = 0 $ $ gives $ b=-(c+d)/6 $ and $ a=(c+d)/2 $. So one description is this. $ {c([ 1/2 -1/6 1 0 ]) +d([ 1/2 -1/6 0 1 ]) such that c,d in ℝ} $ That shows that a set spanning this subspace consists of those two matrices. The $a=2b-c$ gives that the set $ {(2b-c)+bx+cx^3 such that b,c in ℝ} $ equals the set $ {b(2+x)+c(-1+x^3) such that b,c in ℝ} $. So the subspace is the span of the set ${2+x, -1+x^3}$. The set $ {a+bx+cx^2 such that a+7b+49c=0} $ can be parametrized as $ {b(-7+x)+c(-49+x^2) such that b,c in ℝ} $ and so has the spanning set ${-7+x,-49+x^2}$.    Find a set to span the given subspace of the given space. (Hint. Parametrize each.)  the $ xz $-plane in $ ℝ^3 $ $ {[x y z] such that 3x+2y+z=0} $ in $ ℝ^3 $ $ {[x y z w] such that 2x+y+w=0 and y+2z=0} $ in $ ℝ^4 $ $ {a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 such that a_0+a_1=0 and a_2-a_3=0} $ in $ polyspace(_3) $ The set $ polyspace(_4) $ in the space $ polyspace(_4) $ $ matspace(_){N by N} $ in $ matspace(_){N by N} $    We can parametrize in this way $ {[x 0 z] such that x,z in ℝ} ={x[1 0 0] +z[0 0 1] such that x,z in ℝ} $ giving this for a spanning set. $ {[1 0 0],[0 0 1]} $ Here is a parametrization, and the associated spanning set. $ {y[-2/3 1 0]+z[-1/3 0 1] such that y,z in ℝ }  {[-2/3 1 0],[-1/3 0 1] } $ $ {[1 -2 1 0], [-1/2 0 0 1] } $ Parametrize the description as $ {-a_1+a_1x+a_3x^2+a_3x^3 such that a_1,a_3 in ℝ } $ to get $ {-1+x,x^2+x^3}. $ $ {1,x,x^2,x^3,x^4} $ $ { ([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 1 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 1 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } $    Is $ ℝ^2 $ a subspace of $ ℝ^3 $?  Technically, no. Subspaces of $ ℝ^3 $ are sets of three-tall vectors, while $ ℝ^2 $ is a set of two-tall vectors. Clearly though, $ ℝ^2 $ is ``just like'' this subspace of $ ℝ^3 $. $ {[x y 0] such that x,y in ℝ} $   Decide if each is a subspace of the vector space of real-valued functions of one real variable.  The even functions $ {map{{f}{{ ℝ}{{ ℝ} such that f(-x)=f(x) { for all x} $. For example, two members of this set are $f_1(x)=x^2$ and $f_2(x)=cos(x)$. The odd functions $ {map{{f}{{ ℝ}{{ ℝ} such that f(-x)=-f(x) { for all x} $. Two members are $f_3(x)=x^3$ and $f_4(x)=sin(x)$.   Of course, the addition and scalar multiplication operations are the ones inherited from the enclosing space.  This is a subspace. It is not empty as it contains at least the two example functions given. It is closed because if $ f_1,f_2 $ are even and $ c_1,c_2 $ are scalars then we have this. $ (c_1f_1+c_2f_2)(-x) =c_1f_1(-x)+c_2f_2(-x) =c_1f_1(x)+c_2f_2(x) =(c_1f_1+c_2f_2)(x) $ This is also a subspace; the check is similar to the prior one.    says that for any vector $vec(v)$ that is an element of a vector space $V$, the set ${r·vec{{v} such that r in ℝ}$ is a subspace of $V$. (This is of course, simply the span of the singleton set ${vec{{v}}$.) Must any such subspace be a proper subspace, or can it be improper?  It can be improper. If $ vec(v)=0 $ then this is a trivial subspace. At the opposite extreme, if the vector space is $ ℝ^1 $ and $ vec(v) ≠0 $ then the subspace is all of $ ℝ^1$.   An example following the definition of a vector space shows that the solution set of a homogeneous linear system is a vector space. In the terminology of this subsection, it is a subspace of $ ℝ^n$ where the system has $n$ variables. What about a non-homogeneous linear system; do its solutions form a subspace (under the inherited operations)?  No, such a set is not closed. For one thing, it does not contain the zero vector.   Give an example of each or explain why it would be impossible to do so.  A nonempty subset of $matspace(_){N by N}$ that is not a subspace. A set of two vectors in $ ℝ^2$ that does not span the space.    This nonempty subset of $matspace(_){N by N}$ is not a subspace. $ A={ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]), ([ 5 6 7 8 ])} $ One reason that it is not a subspace of $matspace(_){N by N}$ is that it does not contain the zero matrix. (Another reason is that it is not closed under addition, since the sum of the two is not an element of $A$. It is also not closed under scalar multiplication.) This set of two vectors does not span $ ℝ^2$. $ {[1 1],[3 3]} $ No linear combination of these two can give a vector whose second component is unequal to its first component.    shows that $ ℝ^3$ has infinitely many subspaces. Does every nontrivial space have infinitely many subspaces?  No. The only subspaces of $ ℝ^1 $ are the space itself and its trivial subspace. Any subspace $S$ of $ ℝ$ that contains a nonzero member $vec(v)$ must contain the set of all of its scalar multiples ${r·vec{{v} such that r in ℝ}$. But this set is all of $ ℝ$.   Finish the proof of .  Item~(1) is checked in the text.  Item~(2) has five conditions. First, for closure, if $ c in ℝ $ and $ vec(s) in S $ then $ c·vec(s) in S $ as $ c·vec(s)=c·vec(s)+0·0 $. Second, because the operations in $ S $ are inherited from $ V $, for $ c,d in ℝ $ and $ vec(s) in S $, the scalar product $ (c+d)·vec(s) $ in $ S $ equals the product $ (c+d)·vec(s) $ in $ V $, and that equals $ c·vec(s)+d·vec(s) $ in $ V $, which equals $ c·vec(s)+d·vec(s) $ in $ S $.  The check for the third, fourth, and fifth conditions are similar to the second condition's check just given.   Show that each vector space has only one trivial subspace.  An exercise in the prior subsection shows that every vector space has only one zero vector (that is, there is only one vector that is the additive identity element of the space). But a trivial space has only one element and that element must be this (unique) zero vector.   Show that for any subset $ S $ of a vector space, the span of the span equals the span $ span( spanof(S) )=span(S) $. (Hint. Members of $span(S)$ are linear combinations of members of $S$. Members of $span(spanof(S))$ are linear combinations of linear combinations of members of $S$.)  As the hint suggests, the basic reason is the Linear Combination Lemma from the first chapter. For the full proof, we will show mutual containment between the two sets.  The first containment $ span( spanof(S) )⊇span(S) $ is an instance of the more general, and obvious, fact that for any subset $ T $ of a vector space, $ span(T)⊇ T $.  For the other containment, that $ span( spanof(S) )⊆span(S) $, take $m$ vectors from $ span(S) $, namely $ c_{1,1}vec(s)_{1,1}+·s+c_{1,n_1}vec(s)_{1,n_1} $, ..., $ c_{1,m}vec(s)_{1,m}+·s+c_{1,n_m}vec(s)_{1,n_m} $, and note that any linear combination of those $ r_1(c_{1,1}vec(s)_{1,1}+·s+c_{1,n_1}vec(s)_{1,n_1})+·s +r_m(c_{1,m}vec(s)_{1,m}+·s+c_{1,n_m}vec(s)_{1,n_m}) $ is a linear combination of elements of $ S $ $ = (r_1c_{1,1})vec(s)_{1,1}+·s+(r_1c_{1,n_1})vec(s)_{1,n_1}+·s +(r_mc_{1,m})vec(s)_{1,m}+·s+(r_mc_{1,n_m})vec(s)_{1,n_m} $ and so is in $ span(S) $. That is, simply recall that a linear combination of linear combinations (of members of $S$) is a linear combination (again of members of $S$).   All of the subspaces that we've seen in some way use zero in their description. For example, the subspace in consists of all the vectors from $ ℝ^2$ with a second component of zero. In contrast, the collection of vectors from $ ℝ^2$ with a second component of one does not form a subspace (it is not closed under scalar multiplication). Another example is , where the condition on the vectors is that the three components add to zero. If the condition there were that the three components add to one then it would not be a subspace (again, it would fail to be closed). However, a reliance on zero is not strictly necessary. Consider the set $ {[x y z] such that x+y+z=1} $ under these operations. $ [x_1 y_1 z_1]+[x_2 y_2 z_2] =[x_1+x_2-1 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2]  r[x y z]=[rx-r+1 ry rz] $  Show that it is not a subspace of $ ℝ^3$. (Hint. See ). Show that it is a vector space. Note that by the prior item, can not apply. Show that any subspace of $ ℝ^3$ must pass through the origin, and so any subspace of $ ℝ^3$ must involve zero in its description. Does the converse hold? Does any subset of $ ℝ^3$ that contains the origin become a subspace when given the inherited operations?    It is not a subspace because these are not the inherited operations. For one thing, in this space, $ 0·[x y z]=[1 0 0] $ while this does not, of course, hold in $ ℝ^3$. We can combine the argument showing closure under addition with the argument showing closure under scalar multiplication into one single argument showing closure under linear combinations of two vectors. If $r_1,r_2,x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2,z_1,z_2$ are in $ ℝ$ then $ r_1[x_1 y_1 z_1] +r_2[x_2 y_2 z_2] =[r_1x_1-r_1+1 r_1y_1 r_1z_1] +[r_2x_2-r_2+1 r_2y_2 r_2z_2] =[r_1x_1-r_1+r_2x_2-r_2+1 r_1y_1+r_2y_2 r_1z_1+r_2z_2] $ (note that the definition of addition in this space is that the first components combine as $(r_1x_1-r_1+1)+(r_2x_2-r_2+1)-1$, so the first component of the last vector does not say `$+2$'). Adding the three components of the last vector gives $r_1(x_1-1+y_1+z_1)+r_2(x_2-1+y_2+z_2)+1=r_1·0+r_2·0+1=1$.  Most of the other checks of the conditions are easy (although the oddness of the operations keeps them from being routine). Commutativity of addition goes like this. $ [x_1 y_1 z_1]+[x_2 y_2 z_2] =[x_1+x_2-1 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2] =[x_2+x_1-1 y_2+y_1 z_2+z_1] =[x_2 y_2 z_2]+[x_1 y_1 z_1] $ Associativity of addition has $ ([x_1 y_1 z_1]+[x_2 y_2 z_2]) +[x_3 y_3 z_3] =[(x_1+x_2-1)+x_3-1 (y_1+y_2)+y_3 (z_1+z_2)+z_3] $ while $ [x_1 y_1 z_1] +([x_2 y_2 z_2]+[x_3 y_3 z_3]) =[x_1+(x_2+x_3-1)-1 y_1+(y_2+y_3) z_1+(z_2+z_3)] $ and they are equal. The identity element with respect to this addition operation works this way $ [x y z]+[1 0 0] =[x+1-1 y+0 z+0] =[x y z] $ and the additive inverse is similar. $ [x y z]+[-x+2 -y -z] =[x+(-x+2)-1 y-y z-z] =[1 0 0] $  The conditions on scalar multiplication are also easy. For the first condition, $ (r+s)[x y z] =[(r+s)x-(r+s)+1 (r+s)y (r+s)z] $ while $ r[x y z]+s[x y z] =[rx-r+1 ry rz]+[sx-s+1 sy sz] =[(rx-r+1)+(sx-s+1)-1 ry+sy rz+sz] $ and the two are equal. The second condition compares $ r·([x_1 y_1 z_1]+[x_2 y_2 z_2]) =r·[x_1+x_2-1 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2] =[r(x_1+x_2-1)-r+1 r(y_1+y_2) r(z_1+z_2)] $ with $ r[x_1 y_1 z_1]+r[x_2 y_2 z_2] =[rx_1-r+1 ry_1 rz_1] +[rx_2-r+1 ry_2 rz_2] =[(rx_1-r+1)+(rx_2-r+1)-1 ry_1+ry_2 rz_1+rz_2] $ and they are equal. For the third condition, $ (rs)[x y z] =[rsx-rs+1 rsy rsz] $ while $ r(s[x y z]) =r([sx-s+1 sy sz]) =[r(sx-s+1)-r+1 rsy rsz] $ and the two are equal. For scalar multiplication by $1$ we have this. $ 1·[x y z] =[1x-1+1 1y 1z] =[x y z] $ Thus all the conditions on a vector space are met by these two operations.  Remark. A way to understand this vector space is to think of it as the plane in $ ℝ^3$ $ P={[x y z] such that x+y+z=0} $ displaced away from the origin by $1$ along the $x$-axis. Then addition becomes:~to add two members of this space, $ [x_1 y_1 z_1],[x_2 y_2 z_2] $ (such that $x_1+y_1+z_1=1$ and $x_2+y_2+z_2=1$) move them back by $1$ to place them in $P$ and add as usual, $ [x_1-1 y_1 z_1]+[x_2-1 y_2 z_2] =[x_1+x_2-2 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2] (in $P$) $ and then move the result back out by $1$ along the $x$-axis. $ [x_1+x_2-1 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2]. $ Scalar multiplication is similar. For the subspace to be closed under the inherited scalar multiplication, where $vec(v)$ is a member of that subspace, $ 0·vec(v)=[0 0 0] $ must also be a member.  The converse does not hold. Here is a subset of $ ℝ^3$ that contains the origin $ {[0 0 0],[1 0 0]} $ (this subset has only two elements) but is not a subspace.    We can give a justification for the convention that the sum of zero-many vectors equals the zero vector. Consider this sum of three vectors $vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2+vec(v)_3$.  What is the difference between this sum of three vectors and the sum of the first two of these three? What is the difference between the prior sum and the sum of just the first one vector? What should be the difference between the prior sum of one vector and the sum of no vectors? So what should be the definition of the sum of no vectors?    $(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2+vec(v)_3)-(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2) =vec(v)_3$ $(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)-(vec(v)_1) =vec(v)_2$ Surely, $vec(v)_1$. Taking the one-long sum and subtracting gives ($vec(v)_1)-vec(v)_1=0$.    Is a space determined by its subspaces? That is, if two vector spaces have the same subspaces, must the two be equal?  Yes; any space is a subspace of itself, so each space contains the other.    Give a set that is closed under scalar multiplication but not addition. Give a set closed under addition but not scalar multiplication. Give a set closed under neither.    The union of the $ x $-axis and the $ y $-axis in $ ℝ^2 $ is one. The set of integers, as a subset of $ ℝ^1 $, is one. The subset $ {vec{{v}} $ of $ ℝ^2 $ is one, where $vec(v)$ is any nonzero vector.    Show that the span of a set of vectors does not depend on the order in which the vectors are listed in that set.  Because vector space addition is commutative, a reordering of summands leaves a linear combination unchanged.   Which trivial subspace is the span of the empty set? Is it $ {[0 0 0]}⊆ ℝ^3, or {0+0x}⊆ polyspace(_1), $ or some other subspace?  We always consider that span in the context of an enclosing space.   Show that if a vector is in the span of a set then adding that vector to the set won't make the span any bigger. Is that also `only if'?  It is both `if' and `only if'.  For `if', let $ S $ be a subset of a vector space $ V $ and assume $ vec(v) in S $ satisfies $ vec(v)=c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_nvec(s)_n $ where $ c_1,...,c_n $ are scalars and $ vec(s)_1,...,vec(s)_n in S $. We must show that $ span(S∪{vec{{v)} }=span(S) $.  Containment one way, $ span(S)⊆span(S∪{vec{{v)} } $ is obvious. For the other direction, $ span(S∪{vec{{v)} }⊆span(S) $, note that if a vector is in the set on the left then it has the form $ d_0vec(v)+d_1vec(t)_1+...+d_mvec(t)_m $ where the $ d $'s are scalars and the $ vec(t) $'s are in $ S $. Rewrite that as $ d_0(c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_nvec(s)_n) +d_1vec(t)_1+·s+d_mvec(t)_m $ and note that the result is a member of the span of $ S $.  The `only if' is clearly true- adding $ vec(v) $ enlarges the span to include at least $ vec(v) $.   Subspaces are subsets and so we naturally consider how `is a subspace of' interacts with the usual set operations.  If $ A,B $ are subspaces of a vector space, must their intersection $ A intersection B $ be a subspace? Always? Sometimes? Never? Must the union $ A∪ B $ be a subspace? If $ A $ is a subspace, must its complement be a subspace?  (Hint. Try some test subspaces from .)   Always.  Assume that $ A,B $ are subspaces of $ V $. Note that their intersection is not empty as both contain the zero vector. If $ vec(w),vec(s) in A intersection B $ and $ r,s $ are scalars then $ rvec(v)+svec(w) in A $ because each vector is in $ A $ and so a linear combination is in $ A $, and $rvec(v)+svec(w) in B $ for the same reason. Thus the intersection is closed. Now applies. Sometimes (more precisely, only if $ A⊆ B $ or $ B⊆ A $).  To see the answer is not `always', take $ V $ to be $ ℝ^3 $, take $ A $ to be the $x$-axis, and $ B $ to be the $ y $-axis. Note that $ [1 0] in A and [0 1] in B but [1 0]+[0 1] not in A∪ B $ as the sum is in neither $ A $ nor $ B $.  The answer is not `never' because if $ A⊆ B $ or $ B⊆ A $ then clearly $ A∪ B $ is a subspace.  To show that $ A∪ B $ is a subspace only if one subspace contains the other, we assume that $ A not ⊆ B $ and $ B not ⊆ A $ and prove that the union is not a subspace. The assumption that $ A $ is not a subset of $ B $ means that there is an $ vec(a) in A $ with $ vec(a) not in B $. The other assumption gives a $ vec(b) in B $ with $ vec(b) not in A $. Consider $ vec(a)+vec(b) $. Note that sum is not an element of $ A $ or else $ (vec(a)+vec(b))-vec(a) $ would be in $ A $, which it is not. Similarly the sum is not an element of $ B $. Hence the sum is not an element of $ A∪ B $, and so the union is not a subspace. Never. As $ A $ is a subspace, it contains the zero vector, and therefore the set that is $A$'s complement does not. Without the zero vector, the complement cannot be a vector space.    Does the span of a set depend on the enclosing space? That is, if $ W $ is a subspace of $ V $ and $ S $ is a subset of $ W $ (and so also a subset of $ V $), might the span of $ S $ in $ W $ differ from the span of $ S $ in $ V $?  The span of a set does not depend on the enclosing space. A linear combination of vectors from $ S $ gives the same sum whether we regard the operations as those of $ W $ or as those of $ V $, because the operations of $ W $ are inherited from $ V $.   Is the relation `is a subspace of' transitive? That is, if $V$ is a subspace of $W$ and $W$ is a subspace of $X$, must $V$ be a subspace of $X$?  It is; apply . (You must consider the following. Suppose $ B $ is a subspace of a vector space $ V $ and suppose $ A⊆ B⊆ V $ is a subspace. From which space does $ A $ inherit its operations? The answer is that it doesn't matter- $ A $ will inherit the same operations in either case.)   Because `span of' is an operation on sets we naturally consider how it interacts with the usual set operations.  If $ S⊆ T $ are subsets of a vector space, is $ span(S)⊆span(T) $? Always? Sometimes? Never? If $ S,T $ are subsets of a vector space, is $ span(S∪ T)=span(S)∪span(T) $? If $ S,T $ are subsets of a vector space, is $ span(S intersection T)=span(S) intersectionspan(T) $? Is the span of the complement equal to the complement of the span?    Always; if $ S⊆ T $ then a linear combination of elements of $ S $ is also a linear combination of elements of $ T $. Sometimes (more precisely, if and only if $ S⊆ T $ or $ T⊆ S $).  The answer is not `always' as is shown by this example from $ ℝ^3 $ $ S={[1 0 0],[0 1 0]}, T={[1 0 0],[0 0 1]} $ because of this. $ [1 1 1] inspan(S∪ T)  [1 1 1] not inspan(S)∪ span(T) $  The answer is not `never' because if either set contains the other then equality is clear. We can characterize equality as happening only when either set contains the other by assuming $ S not ⊆ T $ (implying the existence of a vector $ vec(s) in S $ with $ vec(s) not in T $) and $ T not ⊆ S $ (giving a $ vec(t) in T $ with $ vec(t) not in S $), noting $ vec(s)+vec(t) inspan(S∪ T) $, and showing that $ vec(s)+vec(t) not inspan(S)∪span(T) $. Sometimes.  Clearly $ span(S intersection T) ⊆span(S) intersectionspan(T) $ because any linear combination of vectors from $ S intersection T $ is a combination of vectors from $ S $ and also a combination of vectors from $ T $.  Containment the other way does not always hold. For instance, in $ ℝ^2 $, take $ S={[1 0],[0 1]}, T={[2 0]} $ so that $ span(S) intersectionspan(T) $ is the $ x $-axis but $ span(S intersection T) $ is the trivial subspace.  Characterizing exactly when equality holds is tough. Clearly equality holds if either set contains the other, but that is not `only if' by this example in $ ℝ^3 $. $ S={[1 0 0],[0 1 0]},  T={[1 0 0],[0 0 1]} $ Never, as the span of the complement is a subspace, while the complement of the span is not (it does not contain the zero vector).    Reprove without doing the empty set separately.  Call the subset $ S $. By , we need to check that $ span(S) $ is closed under linear combinations. If $ c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_nvec(s)_n, c_{n+1}vec(s)_{n+1}+...+c_mvec(s)_m inspan(S) $ then for any $ p,r in ℝ $ we have $ p·(c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n)+ r·(c_{n+1}vec(s)_{n+1}+·s+c_mvec(s)_m) = pc_1vec(s)_1+·s+pc_nvec(s)_n +rc_{n+1}vec(s)_{n+1}+·s+rc_mvec(s)_m $ which is an element of $ span(S) $.     Find a structure that is closed under linear combinations, and yet is not a vector space.    For this to happen, one of the conditions giving the sensibleness of the addition and scalar multiplication operations must be violated. Consider $ ℝ^2 $ with these operations. $ [x_1 y_1] +[x_2 y_2] =[0 0]  r[x y] =[0 0] $ The set $ ℝ^2$ is closed under these operations. But it is not a vector space. $ 1·[1 1] ≠[1 1] $           The prior section shows how to understand a vector space as a span, as an unrestricted linear combination of some of its elements. For example, the space of linear polynomials ${a+bx such that a,b in ℝ}$ is spanned by the set ${1,x}$. The prior section also showed that a space can have many sets that span it. Two more sets that span the space of linear polynomials are ${1,2x}$ and ${1,x,2x}$.  At the end of that section we described some spanning sets as `minimal' but we never precisely defined that word.  We could mean that a spanning set is minimal if it contains the smallest number of members of any set with the same span, so that ${1,x,2x}$ is not minimal because it has three members while we can give two-element sets spanning the same space. Or we could mean that a spanning set is minimal when it has no elements that we can remove without changing the span. Under this meaning ${1,x,2x}$ is not minimal because removing the $ 2x $ to get $ {1,x} $ leaves the span unchanged.  The first sense of minimality appears to be a global requirement, in that to check if a spanning set is minimal we seemingly must look at all the sets that span and find one with the least number of elements. The second sense of minimality is local since we need to look only at the set and consider the span with and without various elements. For instance, using the second sense we could compare the span of ${1,x,2x}$ with the span of ${1,x}$ and note that $2x$ is a ``repeat'' in that its removal doesn't shrink the span.  In this section we will use the second sense of `minimal spanning set' because of this technical convenience. However, the most important result of this book is that the two senses coincide. We will prove that in the next section.            We saw ``repeats'' in the first chapter. There, Gauss's Method turned them into $0=0$ equations.  For example Recall the hyperlink(ex:Statics){Statics} example from Chapter One's opening. We got two balances with the pair of unknown-mass objects, one at $ 40 $~cm and $ 15 $~cm and another at $ -50 $~cm and $ 25 $~cm, and we then computed the value of those masses. Had we instead gotten the second balance at $ 20 $~cm and $ 7.5 $~cm then Gauss's Method on the resulting two-equations, two-unknowns system would not have yielded a solution, it would have yielded a $0=0$ equation along with an equation containing a free variable. Intuitively, the problem is that $ [20 7.5] $ is half of $[40 15]$, that is, $[20 7.5]$ is in the span of the set ${[40 15]}$ and so is repeated data. We would have been trying to solve a two-unknowns problem with essentially only one piece of information.   We take $vec(v)$ to be a ``repeat'' of the vectors in a set~$S$ if $vec(v) inspan(S)$ so that it depends on, that is, is expressible in terms of, elements of the set $vec(v)=c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n$.    Where $V$ is a vector space, $S$ is a subset of that space, and $vec(v)$ is an element of that space, $span(S∪{vec{{v)}} = span(S)$ if and only if $vec(v) inspan(S)$.      Half of the if and only if is immediate: if $vec(v) not inspan(S)$ then the sets are not equal because $vec(v) inspan(S∪{vec{{v)}}$.  For the other half assume that $vec(v) inspan(S)$ so that $vec(v)=c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n$ for some scalars~$c_i$ and vectors $vec(s)_i in S$. We will use mutual containment to show that the sets $span(S∪{vec{{v)}}$ and $span(S)$ are equal. The containment $span(S∪{vec{{v)}}⊇span(S)$ is clear.    To show containment in the other direction let $vec(w)$ be an element of~$span(S∪{vec{{v)}}$. Then $vec(w)$ is a linear combination of elements of $S∪{vec{{v}}$, which we can write as $vec(w)=c_{n+1}vec(s)_{n+1}+·s+c_{n+k}vec(s)_{n+k}+c_{n+k+1}vec(v)$. (Possibly some of the $vec(s)_i$'s from $vec(w)$'s equation are the same as some of those from $vec(v)$'s equation but that does not matter.) Expand $vec(v)$. $ vec(w)=c_{n+1}vec(s)_{n+1}+·s+c_{n+k}vec(s)_{n+k} +c_{n+k+1}·(c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n) $ Recognize the right hand side as a linear combination of linear combinations of vectors from~$S$. Thus $vec(w) inspan(S)$.    The discussion at the section's opening involved removing vectors instead of adding them.    For $vec(v) in S$, omitting that vector does not shrink the span $span(S)=span(S-{vec{{v)}}$ if and only if it is dependent on other vectors in the set~$vec(v) inspan(S)$.    The corollary says that to know whether removing a vector will decrease the span, we need to know whether the vector is a linear combination of others in the set.    A multiset subset of a vector space is linearly independent  if none of its elements is a linear combination of the others.footnote{More information on multisets is in the appendix. Most of the time we won't need the set-multiset distinction and we will follow the standard terminology of referring to a linearly independent or dependent `set'. explains why the definition requires a multiset.}spacefactor=1000\ Otherwise it is linearly dependent .    That definition's use of the word `others' means that writing $vec(v)$ as a linear combination with $vec(v)=1·vec(v)$ does not count.   Observe that, although this way of writing one vector as a combination of the others $ vec(s)_0=Linear combination of c{vec(s)} $ visually sets off $ vec(s)_0 $, algebraically there is nothing special about that vector in that equation. For any $ vec(s)_i $ with a coefficient $c_i$ that is non-$0$ we can rewrite to isolate $ vec(s)_i $. $ vec(s)_i=(1/c_i)vec(s)_0+... +(-c_{i-1}/c_i)vec(s)_{i-1}+(-c_{i+1}/c_i)vec(s)_{i+1} +...+(-c_n/c_i)vec(s)_n $ When we don't want to single out any vector we will instead say that $ vec(s)_0,vec(s)_1,...,vec(s)_n $ are in a linear relationship  and put all of the vectors on the same side.  The next result rephrases the linear independence definition in this style. It is how we usually compute whether a finite set is dependent or independent.    A subset $ S $ of a vector space is linearly independent if and only if among its elements the only linear relationship $ c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_nvec(s)_n=0$ (with $vec(s)_i ≠vec(s)_j$ for all $i ≠ j$) is the trivial one $ c_1=0,...,c_n=0 $.      If $ S $ is linearly independent then no vector $vec(s)_i$ is a linear combination of other vectors from $S$ so there is no linear relationship where some of the $vec(s)$'s have nonzero coefficients.  If $ S $ is not linearly independent then some $ vec(s)_i $ is a linear combination $vec(s)_i=c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_{i-1}vec(s)_{i-1} +c_{i+1}vec(s)_{i+1}+...+c_nvec(s)_n$ of other vectors from $ S $. Subtracting $vec(s)_i$ from both sides gives a relationship involving a nonzero coefficient, the $ -1 $ in front of $ vec(s)_i $.    For example In the vector space of two-wide row vectors, the two-element set $ { [40 15],[-50 25]} $ is linearly independent. To check this, take $ c_1·[40 15]+c_2·[-50 25]=[0 0] $ and solve the resulting system. $ $ 40c_1 - 50c_2 = 0 15c_1 + 25c_2 = 0 $ for step $-(15/40)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 40c_1 - 50c_2 = 0 (175/4)c_2 = 0 $ $ Both $ c_1 $ and $ c_2 $ are zero. So the only linear relationship between the two given row vectors is the trivial relationship.  In the same vector space, the set $ { [40 15],[20 7.5]} $ is linearly dependent since we can satisfy  $c_1· [40 15]+c_2·[20 7.5]=[0 0]$  with $ c_1=1 $ and $ c_2=-2 $.   For example The set $ {1+x,1-x} $ is linearly independent in $ polyspace(_2) $, the space of quadratic polynomials with real coefficients, because $ 0+0x+0x^2 = c_1(1+x)+c_2(1-x) = (c_1+c_2)+(c_1-c_2)x+0x^2 $ gives $ $ c_1 + c_2 = 0 c_1 - c_2 = 0 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ c_1 + c_2 = 0 2c_2 = 0 $ $ since polynomials are equal only if their coefficients are equal. Thus, the only linear relationship between these two members of $polyspace(_2)$ is the trivial one.   For example The rows of this matrix $ A= ([ 2 3 1 0 0 -1 0 -2 0 0 0 1 ]) $ form a linearly independent set. This is easy to check for this case but also recall that Lemma~One.III. shows that the rows of any echelon form matrix form a linearly independent set.   For example In $ ℝ^3 $, where $ vec(v)_1=[3 4 5]  vec(v)_2=[2 9 2]  vec(v)_3=[4 18 4] $ the set $ S={vec{{v}_1,vec{{v}_2,vec{{v}_3} $ is linearly dependent because this is a relationship $ 0·vec(v)_1 +2·vec(v)_2 -1·vec(v)_3 =0 $ where not all of the scalars are zero (the fact that some of the scalars are zero doesn't matter).    That example illustrates why, although def:LinInd is a clearer statement of what independence means, is better for computations. Working straight from the definition, someone trying to compute whether $S$ is linearly independent would start by setting $ vec(v)_1=c_2vec(v)_2+c_3vec(v)_3 $ and concluding that there are no such $c_2$ and $c_3$. But knowing that the first vector is not dependent on the other two is not enough. This person would have to go on to try $ vec(v)_2=c_1vec(v)_1+c_3vec(v)_3 $, in order to find the dependence $c_1=0$, $ c_3=1/2 $.  gets the same conclusion with only one computation.   For example The empty subset of a vector space is linearly independent. There is no nontrivial linear relationship among its members as it has no members.   For example In any vector space, any subset containing the zero vector is linearly dependent. One example is, in the space $polyspace(_2)$ of quadratic polynomials, the subset ${1+x,x+x^2,0}$. It is linearly dependent because $0·vec(v)_1+0·vec(v)_2+1·0=0$ is a nontrivial relationship, since not all of the coefficients are zero.  A subtler way to see that this subset is dependent is to remember that the zero vector is equal to the trivial sum, the sum of the empty set. So any set containing the zero vector has an element that is a combination of a subset of other vectors from the set, specifically, the zero vector is a combination of the empty subset.    def:LinInd says that when we decide whether some $S$ is linearly independent we must consider it as a multiset. Recall that in a set repeated elements collapse, so the set ${0,1,0}$ equals the set ${0,1}$. But in a multiset they do not collapse so the multiset ${0,1,0}$ contains the element $0$ twice. Here is an example showing why the definition requires a multiset. $ ([ 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 3 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 ]) $ On the left the set of matrix rows ${[1 1 1], [2 2 2], [1 2 3]}$ is linearly dependent. But on the right the set ${[1 1 1], [1 1 1], [1 2 3]}= {[1 1 1], [1 2 3]}$ is linearly independent. That's not what we need; we rely on Gauss's Method to preserve dependence so we need that $[1 1 1]$ appears twice.                        A set $S$ is linearly independent if and only if for any $vec(v) in S$, its removal shrinks the span $span(S-{v)}⊊span(S)$.      This follows from . If $S$ is linearly independent then none of its vectors is dependent on the other elements, so removal of any vector will shrink the span. If $S$ is not linearly independent then it contains a vector that is dependent on other elements of the set, and removal of that vector will not shrink the span.    So a spanning set is minimal if and only if it is linearly independent.  The prior result addresses removing elements from a linearly independent set. The next one adds elements.    Suppose that $S$ is linearly independent and that $vec(v) not in S$. Then the set $S∪{vec{{v}}$ is linearly independent if and only if $vec(v) not inspan(S)$.       We will show that $S∪{vec{{v}}$ is not linearly independent if and only if $vec(v) inspan(S)$.  Suppose first that $v inspan(S)$. Express $vec(v)$ as a combination $vec(v)=c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n$. Rewrite that $0=c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n-1·vec(v)$. Since $v not in S$, it does not equal any of the $vec(s)_i$ so this is a nontrivial linear dependence among the elements of $S∪{vec{{v}}$. Thus that set is not linearly independent.    Now suppose that $S∪{vec{{v}}$ is not linearly independent and consider a nontrivial dependence among its members $0=c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n+c_{n+1}·vec(v)$. If $c_{n+1}=0$ then that is a dependence among the elements of~$S$, but we are assuming that~$S$ is independent, so $c_{n+1} ≠ 0$. Rewrite the equation as $vec(v)=(c_1/c_{n+1})vec(s)_1+·s+(c_n/c_{n+1})vec(s)_n$ to get $vec(v) inspan(S)$      For example This subset of $ ℝ^3$ is linearly independent. $ S ={[1 0 0]} $ The span of $S$ is the $x$-axis. Here are two supersets, one that is linearly dependent and the other independent.  dependent: $ { [1 0 0], [-3 0 0]} $  independent: $ { [1 0 0], [0 1 0]} $  We got the dependent superset by adding a vector from the $x$-axis and so the span did not grow. We got the independent superset by adding a vector that isn't in $span(S)$, because it has a nonzero $y$~component, causing the span to grow.  For the independent set $ S ={[1 0 0], [0 1 0] } $ the span $ span(S) $ is the $ xy $-plane. Here are two supersets.  dependent: $ { [1 0 0], [0 1 0], [3 -2 0] } $  independent: $ { [1 0 0], [0 1 0], [0 0 1] } $  As above, the additional member of the dependent superset comes from $span(S)$, the $xy$-plane, while the added member of the independent superset comes from outside of that span.  Finally, consider this independent set $ S ={[1 0 0], [0 1 0], [0 0 1] } $ with $ span(S)= ℝ^3 $. We can get a linearly dependent superset.  dependent: $ { [1 0 0], [0 1 0], [0 0 1], [2 -1 3] } $  But there is no linearly independent superset os $S$. One way to see that is to note that for any vector that we would add to $S$, the equation $ [x y z] =c_1[1 0 0] +c_2[0 1 0] +c_3[0 0 1] $ has a solution $c_1=x$, $c_2=y$, and $c_3=z$. Another way to see it is that we cannot add any vectors from outside of the span $span(S)$ because that span is $ ℝ^3$.     In a vector space, any finite set has a linearly independent subset with the same span.      If $ S={ vec{{s}_1,...,vec{{s}_n} $ is linearly independent then $S$ itself satisfies the statement, so assume that it is linearly dependent.    By the definition of dependent, $S$ contains a vector $vec(v)_1$ that is a linear combination of the others. Define the set $ S_1=S-{vec{{v}_1} $. By the span does not shrink $ span(S_1)=span(S) $.    If $ S_1 $ is linearly independent then we are done. Otherwise iterate: take a vector $vec(v)_2$ that is a linear combination of other members of $S_1$ and discard it to derive $ S_2=S_1-{vec{{v}_2} $ such that $ span(S_2)=span(S_1) $. Repeat this until a linearly independent set $S_j$ appears; one must appear eventually because $ S $ is finite and the empty set is linearly independent.  (Formally, this argument uses induction on the number of elements in $S$. asks for the details.)   Thus if we have a set that is linearly dependent then we can, without changing the span, pare down by discarding what we have called ``repeat'' vectors.  For example This set spans $ ℝ^3 $ (the check is routine) but is not linearly independent. $ S={[1 0 0], [0 2 0], [1 2 0], [0 -1 1], [3 3 0] } $ We will calculate which vectors to drop in order to get a subset that is independent but has the same span. This linear relationship $ c_1[1 0 0] +c_2[0 2 0] +c_3[1 2 0] +c_4[0 -1 1] +c_5[3 3 0] =[0 0 0]  $ gives a system $ $ c_1 + c_3 + + 3c_5 = 0 2c_2 + 2c_3 - c_4 + 3c_5 = 0 c_4 = 0 $ $ whose solution set has this parametrization. $ {[c_1 c_2 c_3 c_4 c_5]= c_3[-1 -1 1 0 0] +c_5[-3 -3/2 0 0 1] such that c_3,c_5 in ℝ } $ Set $c_5=1$ and~$c_3=0$ to get an instance of ($*$). $ -3·[1 0 0] -(3/2)·[0 2 0] +0·[1 2 0] +0·[0 -1 1] +1·[3 3 0] =[0 0 0] $ This shows that the vector from $S$ that we've associated with~$c_5$ is in the span of the set of $c_1$'s vector and $c_2$'s vector. We can discard $S$'s fifth vector without shrinking the span.  Similarly, set $c_3=1$, and $c_5=0$ to get an instance of~($*$) that shows we can discard $S$'s third vector without shrinking the span. Thus this set has the same span as $S$. $  {[1 0 0], [0 2 0], [0 -1 1] } $ The check that it is linearly independent is routine.     A subset $ S={vec{{s}_1,...,vec{{s}_n} $ of a vector space is linearly dependent if and only if some $ vec(s_i) $ is a linear combination of the vectors $ vec(s)_1 $, ..., $ vec(s)_{i-1} $ listed before it.      Consider $ S_0={} $, $ S_1={vec{{s_1}} $, $ S_2={vec{{s}_1,vec{{s}_2 } $, etc. Some index $ i≥ 1 $ is the first one with $ S_{i-1}∪{vec{{s}_i } $ linearly dependent, and there $ vec(s)_i inspan( S_{i-1) } $.    The proof of describes producing a linearly independent set by shrinking, by taking subsets. And the proof of describes finding a linearly dependent set by taking supersets. We finish this subsection by considering how linear independence and dependence interact with the subset relation between sets.    Any subset of a linearly independent set is also linearly independent. Any superset of a linearly dependent set is also linearly dependent.      Both are clear.     Restated, subset preserves independence and superset preserves dependence.   Those are two of the four possible cases. The third case, whether subset preserves linear dependence, is covered by , which gives a linearly dependent set $S$ with one subset that is linearly dependent and another that is independent. The fourth case, whether superset preserves linear independence, is covered by , which gives cases where a linearly independent set has both an independent and a dependent superset. This table summarizes. skip   [b]  {$ Ŝ⊆ S $} {$ Ŝsupset(S) $}  $S$ independent $ Ŝ $ must be independent $ Ŝ $ may be either  $S$ dependent $ Ŝ $ may be either $ Ŝ $ must be dependent     skip  has something else to say about the interaction between linear independence and superset. It names a linearly independent set that is maximal in that it has no supersets that are linearly independent. By a linearly independent set is maximal if and only if it spans the entire space, because that is when all the vectors in the space are already in the span. This nicely complements , that a spanning set is minimal if and only if it is linearly independent.            Decide whether each subset of $ ℝ^3 $ is linearly dependent or linearly independent.  $ {[1 -3 5], [2 2 4], [4 -4 14] } $ $ {[1 7 7], [2 7 7], [3 7 7] } $ $ {[0 0 -1], [1 0 4] } $ $ {[9 9 0], [2 0 1], [3 5 -4], [12 12 -1] } $   For each of these, when the subset is independent you must prove it, and when the subset is dependent you must give an example of a dependence.  It is dependent. Considering $ c_1[1 -3 5] +c_2[2 2 4] +c_3[4 -4 14] =[0 0 0] $ gives this linear system. $ $ c_1 + 2c_2 + 4c_3 = 0 -3c_1 + 2c_2 - 4c_3 = 0 5c_1 + 4c_2 + 14c_3 = 0 $ $ Gauss's Method $ ([ 1 2 4 0 -3 2 -4 0 5 4 14 0 ]) for step $3ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $(3/4)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 4 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ yields a free variable, so there are infinitely many solutions. For an example of a particular dependence we can set $c_3$ to be, say, $1$. Then we get $ c_2=-1 $ and $ c_1=-2 $. It is dependent. The linear system that arises here $ ([ 1 2 3 0 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 0 ]) for step $-7ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 3 0 0 -7 -14 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ has infinitely many solutions. We can get a particular solution by taking $c_3$ to be, say, $1$, and back-substituting to get the resulting $c_2$ and $c_1$. It is linearly independent. The system $ ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 -1 4 0 ]) for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ repeat step $ρ_3↔ρ_1$ ([ -1 4 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]) $ has only the solution $c_1=0$ and $c_2=0$. (We could also have gotten the answer by inspection- the second vector is obviously not a multiple of the first, and vice versa.) It is linearly dependent. The linear system $ ([ 9 2 3 12 0 9 0 5 12 0 0 1 -4 -1 0 ]) $ has more unknowns than equations, and so Gauss's Method must end with at least one variable free (there can't be a contradictory equation because the system is homogeneous, and so has at least the solution of all zeroes). To exhibit a combination, we can do the reduction $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ for step $(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 9 2 3 12 0 0 -2 2 0 0 0 0 -3 -1 0 ]) $ and take, say, $c_4=1$. Then we have that $c_3=-1/3$, $c_2=-1/3$, and $c_1=-31/27$.    Which of these subsets of $ polyspace(_3) $ are linearly dependent and which are independent?  $ {3-x+9x^2,5-6x+3x^2,1+1x-5x^2} $ $ {-x^2,1+4x^2} $ $ {2+x+7x^2,3-x+2x^2,4-3x^2} $ $ {8+3x+3x^2,x+2x^2,2+2x+2x^2,8-2x+5x^2} $   In the cases of independence, you must prove that it is independent. Otherwise, you must exhibit a dependence. (Here we give a specific dependence but others are possible.)  This set is independent. Setting up the relation $ c_1(3-x+9x^2)+c_2(5-6x+3x^2)+c_3(1+1x-5x^2)=0+0x+0x^2 $ gives a linear system $ ([ 3 5 1 0 -1 -6 1 0 9 3 -5 0 ]) for step $(1/3)ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $3ρ_2$ repeat step $-(12/13)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 3 5 1 0 0 -13 4 0 0 0 -128/13 0 ]) $ with only one solution: $ c_1=0 $, $ c_2=0 $, and $ c_3=0 $. This set is independent. We can see this by inspection, straight from the definition of linear independence. Obviously neither is a multiple of the other. This set is linearly independent. The linear system reduces in this way $ ([ 2 3 4 0 1 -1 0 0 7 2 -3 0 ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-(17/5)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 2 3 4 0 0 -5/2 -2 0 0 0 -51/5 0 ]) $ to show that there is only the solution $c_1=0$, $c_2=0$, and $c_3=0$. This set is linearly dependent. The linear system $ ([ 8 0 2 8 0 3 1 2 -2 0 3 2 2 5 0 ]) $ must, after reduction, end with at least one variable free (there are more variables than equations, and there is no possibility of a contradictory equation because the system is homogeneous). We can take the free variables as parameters to describe the solution set. We can then set the parameter to a nonzero value to get a nontrivial linear relation.   Determine if each set is linearly independent in the natural space.  ${[1 2 0], [-1 1 0]}$ ${[1 3 1], [-1 4 3], [-1 11 7]}$ ${([ 5 4 1 2 ]), ([ 0 0 0 0 ]), ([ 1 0 -1 4 ]) }$    The natural vector space is $ ℝ^3$. Set up the equation $ [0 0 0]=c_1[1 2 0] +c_2[-1 1 0] $ and consider the resulting homogeneous system. $ ([ 1 -1 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 -1 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 ]) $ This has the unique solution, that $c_1=0$, $c_2=0$. So it is linearly independent. The natural vector space is the set of three-wide row vectors. The equation $ [0 0 0]=c_1[1 3 1] +c_2[-1 4 3] +c_3[-1 11 7] $ gives rise to a linear system $ ([ 1 -1 -1 0 3 4 11 0 1 3 7 0 ]) for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 -1 -1 0 0 7 14 0 0 4 8 0 ]) for step $(4/7)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 -1 -1 0 0 7 14 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ with infinitely many solutions, that is, more than just the trivial solution. $ {[c_1 c_2 c_3] =[-1 -2 1]c_3 such that c_3 in ℝ} $ So the set is linearly dependent. One dependence comes from setting $c_3=2$, giving $c_1=-2$ and $c_2=-4$. Without having to set up a system we can see that the second element of the set is a multiple of the first (namely, $0$ times the first).    Prove that each set $ {f,g} $ is linearly independent in the vector space of all functions from $ ℝ^+ $ to $ ℝ $.  $ f(x)=x $ and $ g(x)=1/x $ $ f(x)=cos(x) $ and $ g(x)=sin(x) $ $ f(x)=e^x $ and $ g(x)=ln(x) $   Let $Z$ be the zero function $Z(x)=0$, which is the additive identity in the vector space under discussion.  This set is linearly independent. Consider $ c_1· f(x)+c_2· g(x)=Z(x) $. Plugging in $ x=1 $ and $ x=2 $ gives a linear system $ $ c_1· 1 + c_2· 1 = 0 c_1· 2 + c_2· (1/2) = 0 $ $ with the unique solution $ c_1=0 $, $ c_2=0 $. This set is linearly independent. Consider $ c_1· f(x)+c_2· g(x)=Z(x) $ and plug in $ x=0 $ and $ x=π/2 $ to get $ $ c_1· 1 + c_2· 0 = 0 c_1· 0 + c_2· 1 = 0 $ $ which obviously gives that $ c_1=0 $, $ c_2=0 $. This set is also linearly independent. Considering $ c_1· f(x)+c_2· g(x)=Z(x) $ and plugging in $ x=1 $ and $ x=e $ $ $ c_1· e + c_2· 0 = 0 c_1· e^e + c_2· 1 = 0 $ $ gives that $ c_1=0 $ and $ c_2=0 $.    Which of these subsets of the space of real-valued functions of one real variable is linearly dependent and which is linearly independent? (We have abbreviated some constant functions;~e.g., in the first item, the `$2$' stands for the constant function $f(x)=2$.)  $ {2,4sin(x),cos(x)} $ $ {1,sin(x),sin(2x)} $ $ {x,cos(x)} $ $ {(1+x)^2,x^2+2x,3} $ $ {cos(2x),sin(x),cos(x)} $ $ {0,x,x^2} $   In each case, if the set is independent then you must prove that and if it is dependent then you must exhibit a dependence.  This set is dependent. The familiar relation $sin(x)+cos(x)=1$ shows that $2=c_1·(4sin(x))+c_2·(cos(x))$ is satisfied by $c_1=1/2$ and $c_2=2$. This set is independent. Consider the relationship $c_1· 1+c_2·sin(x)+c_3·sin(2x)=0$ (that `$0$' is the zero function). Taking three suitable points such as $x=π$, $x=π/2$, $x=π/4$ gives a system $ $ c_1 = 0 c_1 + c_2 = 0 c_1 + (√{2}/2)c_2 + c_3 = 0 $ $ whose only solution is $c_1=0$, $c_2=0$, and $c_3=0$. By inspection, this set is independent. Any dependence $cos(x)=c· x$ is not possible since the cosine function is not a multiple of the identity function (we are applying ). By inspection, we spot that there is a dependence. Because $(1+x)^2=x^2+2x+1$, we get that $c_1·(1+x)^2+c_2·(x^2+2x)=3$ is satisfied by $c_1=3$ and $c_2=-3$. This set is dependent. The easiest way to see that is to recall the trigonometric relationship $cos(x)-sin(x)=cos(2x)$. (Remark. A person who doesn't recall this, and tries some $x$'s, simply never gets a system leading to a unique solution, and never gets to conclude that the set is independent. Of course, this person might wonder if they simply never tried the right set of $x$'s, but a few tries will lead most people to look instead for a dependence.) This set is dependent, because it contains the zero object in the vector space, the zero polynomial.    Does the equation $ sin(x)/cos(x)=tan(x) $ show that this set of functions $ {sin(x),cos(x),tan(x)} $ is a linearly dependent subset of the set of all real-valued functions with domain the interval $ (-π/2..π/2) $ of real numbers between $ -π/2 $ and $ π/2) $?  No, that equation is not a linear relationship. In fact this set is independent, as the system arising from taking $ x $ to be $ 0 $, $ π/6 $ and $ π/4 $ shows.   Is the $xy$-plane subset of the vector space $ ℝ^3$ linearly independent?  No. Here are two members of the plane where the second is a multiple of the first. $ [1 0 0],[2 0 0] $ (Another reason that the answer is ``no'' is the the zero vector is a member of the plane and no set containing the zero vector is linearly independent.)   Show that the nonzero rows of an echelon form matrix form a linearly independent set.  We have already showed this: the Linear Combination Lemma and its corollary state that in an echelon form matrix, no nonzero row is a linear combination of the others.    Show that if the set $ {vec{{u},vec{{v},vec{{w}} $ is linearly independent then so is the set $ {vec{{u},vec{{u}+vec{{v},vec{{u}+vec{{v}+vec{{w}} $. What is the relationship between the linear independence or dependence of $ {vec{{u},vec{{v},vec{{w}} $ and the independence or dependence of $ {vec{{u}-vec{{v},vec{{v}-vec{{w},vec{{w}-vec{{u}} $?    Assume that $ {vec{{u},vec{{v},vec{{w}} $ is linearly independent, so that any relationship $d_0vec(u)+d_1vec(v)+d_2vec(w)=0$ leads to the conclusion that $d_0=0$, $d_1=0$, and $d_2=0$.  Consider the relationship $ c_1(vec(u))+c_2(vec(u)+vec(v))+c_3(vec(u)+vec(v)+vec(w)) =0 $. Rewrite it to get $ (c_1+c_2+c_3)vec(u)+(c_2+c_3)vec(v)+(c_3)vec(w)=0 $. Taking $d_0$ to be $c_1+c_2+c_3$, taking $d_1$ to be $c_2+c_3$, and taking $d_2$ to be $c_3$ we have this system. $ $ c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0 c_2 + c_3 = 0 c_3 = 0 $ $ Conclusion:~the $c$'s are all zero, and so the set is linearly independent. The second set is dependent $ 1·(vec(u)-vec(v)) +1·(vec(v)-vec(w)) +1·(vec(w)-vec(u)) =0 $ whether or not the first set is independent.    shows that the empty set is linearly independent.  When is a one-element set linearly independent? How about a set with two elements?    A singleton set ${vec{{v}}$ is linearly independent if and only if $vec(v) ≠0$. For the `if' direction, with $vec(v) ≠0$, we can apply by considering the relationship $ c·vec(v)=0 $ and noting that the only solution is the trivial one:~$c=0$. For the `only~if' direction, just recall that  shows that ${0}$ is linearly dependent, and so if the set ${vec{{v}}$ is linearly independent then $vec(v) ≠0$.  (Remark. Another answer is to say that this is the special case of  where $ S=mptyset $.) A set with two elements is linearly independent if and only if neither member is a multiple of the other (note that if one is the zero vector then it is a multiple of the other). This is an equivalent statement:~a set is linearly dependent if and only if one element is a multiple of the other.  The proof is easy. A set ${vec{{v}_1,vec{{v}_2}$ is linearly dependent if and only if there is a relationship $c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2=0$ with either $c_1 ≠ 0$ or $c_2 ≠ 0$ (or both). That holds if and only if $vec(v)_1=(-c_2/c_1)vec(v)_2$ or $vec(v)_2=(-c_1/c_2)vec(v)_1$ (or both).    In any vector space $ V $, the empty set is linearly independent. What about all of $ V $?  This set is linearly dependent set because it contains the zero vector.   Show that if $ {vec{{x},vec{{y},vec{{z}} $ is linearly independent then so are all of its proper subsets:~$ {vec{{x},vec{{y}} $, $ {vec{{x},vec{{z}} $, $ {vec{{y},vec{{z}} $, $ {vec{{x}} $,$ {vec{{y}} $, $ {vec{{z}} $, and $ {} $. Is that `only if' also?  gives the `if' half. The converse (the `only if' statement) does not hold. An example is to consider the vector space $ ℝ^2 $ and these vectors. $ vec(x)=[1 0], vec(y)=[0 1], vec(z)=[1 1] $    Show that this $ S={[1 1 0],[-1 2 0]} $ is a linearly independent subset of $ ℝ^3 $. Show that $ [3 2 0] $ is in the span of $S$ by finding $ c_1 $ and $ c_2 $ giving a linear relationship. $ c_1[1 1 0] +c_2[-1 2 0] =[3 2 0] $ Show that the pair $ c_1,c_2 $ is unique. Assume that $ S $ is a subset of a vector space and that $ vec(v) $ is in $ span(S) $, so that $ vec(v) $ is a linear combination of vectors from $ S $. Prove that if $ S $ is linearly independent then a linear combination of vectors from $ S $ adding to $ vec(v) $ is unique (that is, unique up to reordering and adding or taking away terms of the form $ 0·vec(s) $). Thus $ S $ as a spanning set is minimal in this strong sense: each vector in $ span(S) $ is a combination of elements of $S$ a minimum number of times- only once.  Prove that it can happen when $ S $ is not linearly independent that distinct linear combinations sum to the same vector.    The linear system arising from $ c_1[1 1 0] +c_2[-1 2 0] =[0 0 0] $ has the unique solution $ c_1=0 $ and $ c_2=0 $. The linear system arising from $ c_1[1 1 0] +c_2[-1 2 0] =[3 2 0] $ has the unique solution $ c_1=8/3 $ and $ c_2=-1/3 $. Suppose that $ S $ is linearly independent. Suppose that we have both $vec(v)=c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_nvec(s)_n$ and $vec(v)=d_1vec(t)_1+...+d_mvec(t)_m$ (where the vectors are members of $S$). Now, $ c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_nvec(s)_n =vec(v) =d_1vec(t)_1+...+d_mvec(t)_m $ can be rewritten in this way. $ c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_nvec(s)_n -d_1vec(t)_1-...-d_mvec(t)_m =0 $ Possibly some of the $vec(s)$'s equal some of the $vec(t)$'s; we can combine the associated coefficients (i.e., if $vec(s)_i=vec(t)_j$ then $·s+c_ivec(s)_i+...-d_jvec(t)_j-·s$ can be rewritten as $·s+(c_i-d_j)vec(s)_i+·s$). That equation is a linear relationship among distinct (after the combining is done) members of the set $S$. We've assumed that $S$ is linearly independent, so all of the coefficients are zero. If $i$ is such that $vec(s)_i$ does not equal any $vec(t)_j$ then $c_i$ is zero. If $j$ is such that $vec(t)_j$ does not equal any $vec(s)_i$ then $d_j$ is zero. In the final case, we have that $c_i-d_j=0$ and so $c_i=d_j$.  Therefore, the original two sums are the same, except perhaps for some $0·vec(s)_i$ or $0·vec(t)_j$ terms that we can neglect.  This set is not linearly independent: $ S={[1 0],[2 0]}⊆ ℝ^2 $ and these two linear combinations give the same result $ [0 0]=2·[1 0]-1·[2 0] =4·[1 0]-2·[2 0] $ Thus, a linearly dependent set might have indistinct sums.  In fact, this stronger statement holds:~if a set is linearly dependent then it must have the property that there are two distinct linear combinations that sum to the same vector. Briefly, where $ c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_nvec(s)_n=0 $ then multiplying both sides of the relationship by two gives another relationship. If the first relationship is nontrivial then the second is also.    Prove that a polynomial gives rise to the zero function if and only if it is the zero polynomial. (Comment. This question is not a Linear Algebra matter but we often use the result. A polynomial gives rise to a function in the natural way:~$x↦ c_nx^n+...+c_1x+c_0$.)  In this `if and only if' statement, the `if' half is clear- if the polynomial is the zero polynomial then the function that arises from the action of the polynomial must be the zero function $x↦ 0$. For `only if' we write $p(x)=c_nx^n+...+c_0$. Plugging in zero $p(0)=0$ gives that $c_0=0$. Taking the derivative and plugging in zero $p^prime(0)=0$ gives that $c_1=0$. Similarly we get that each $c_i$ is zero, and $p$ is the zero polynomial.   Return to Section 1.2 and redefine point, line, plane, and other linear surfaces to avoid degenerate cases.  The work in this section suggests that we should define an $ n $-dimensional non-degenerate linear surface as the span of a linearly independent set of $ n $ vectors.    Show that any set of four vectors in $ ℝ^2 $ is linearly dependent. Is this true for any set of five? Any set of three? What is the most number of elements that a linearly independent subset of $ ℝ^2$ can have?    For any $a_{1,1}$, ..., $a_{2,4}$, $ c_1[a_{1,1] a_{2,1}} +c_2[a_{1,2] a_{2,2}} +c_3[a_{1,3] a_{2,3}} +c_4[a_{1,4] a_{2,4}} =[0 0] $ yields a linear system $ $ a_{1,1}c_1 + a_{1,2}c_2 + a_{1,3}c_3 + a_{1,4}c_4 = 0 a_{2,1}c_1 + a_{2,2}c_2 + a_{2,3}c_3 + a_{2,4}c_4 = 0 $ $ that has infinitely many solutions (Gauss's Method leaves at least two variables free). Hence there are nontrivial linear relationships among the given members of $ ℝ^2$. Any set five vectors is a superset of a set of four vectors, and so is linearly dependent.  With three vectors from $ ℝ^2$, the argument from the prior item still applies, with the slight change that Gauss's Method now only leaves at least one variable free (but that still gives infinitely many solutions). The prior item shows that no three-element subset of $ ℝ^2$ is independent. We know that there are two-element subsets of $ ℝ^2$ that are independent- one is $ {[1 0],[0 1]} $ and so the answer is two.    Is there a set of four vectors in $ ℝ^3 $ such that any three form a linearly independent set?  Yes; here is one. $ {[1 0 0], [0 1 0], [0 0 1], [1 1 1] } $   Must every linearly dependent set have a subset that is dependent and a subset that is independent?  Yes. The two improper subsets, the entire set and the empty subset, serve as examples.   In $ ℝ^4 $ what is the biggest linearly independent set you can find? The smallest? The biggest linearly dependent set? The smallest? (`Biggest' and `smallest' mean that there are no supersets or subsets with the same property.)  In $ ℝ^4 $ the biggest linearly independent set has four vectors. There are many examples of such sets, this is one. $ {[1 0 0 0], [0 1 0 0], [0 0 1 0], [0 0 0 1] } $ To see that no set with five or more vectors can be independent, set up $ c_1[a_{1,1] a_{2,1} a_{3,1} a_{4,1}} +c_2[a_{1,2] a_{2,2} a_{3,2} a_{4,2}} +c_3[a_{1,3] a_{2,3} a_{3,3} a_{4,3}} +c_4[a_{1,4] a_{2,4} a_{3,4} a_{4,4}} +c_5[a_{1,5] a_{2,5} a_{3,5} a_{4,5}} =[0 0 0 0] $ and note that the resulting linear system $ $ a_{1,1}c_1 + a_{1,2}c_2 + a_{1,3}c_3 + a_{1,4}c_4 + a_{1,5}c_5 = 0 a_{2,1}c_1 + a_{2,2}c_2 + a_{2,3}c_3 + a_{2,4}c_4 + a_{2,5}c_5 = 0 a_{3,1}c_1 + a_{3,2}c_2 + a_{3,3}c_3 + a_{3,4}c_4 + a_{3,5}c_5 = 0 a_{4,1}c_1 + a_{4,2}c_2 + a_{4,3}c_3 + a_{4,4}c_4 + a_{4,5}c_5 = 0 $ $ has four equations and five unknowns, so Gauss's Method must end with at least one $ c $ variable free, so there are infinitely many solutions, and so the above linear relationship among the four-tall vectors has more solutions than just the trivial solution.  The smallest linearly independent set is the empty set.  The biggest linearly dependent set is $ ℝ^4 $. The smallest is $ {0} $.   Linear independence and linear dependence are properties of sets. We can thus naturally ask how the properties of linear independence and dependence act with respect to the familiar elementary set relations and operations. In this body of this subsection we have covered the subset and superset relations. We can also consider the operations of intersection, complementation, and union.  How does linear independence relate to intersection:~can an intersection of linearly independent sets be independent? Must it be? How does linear independence relate to complementation? Show that the union of two linearly independent sets can be linearly independent. Show that the union of two linearly independent sets need not be linearly independent.    The intersection of two linearly independent sets $S intersection T$ must be linearly independent as it is a subset of the linearly independent set $S$ (as well as the linearly independent set $T$ also, of course). The complement of a linearly independent set is linearly dependent as it contains the zero vector. A simple example in $ ℝ^2 $ is these two sets. $ S={[1 0]}  T={[0 1]} $ A somewhat subtler example, again in $ ℝ^2 $, is these two. $ S={[1 0]}  T={[1 0], [0 1]} $ We must produce an example. One, in $ ℝ^2 $, is $ S={[1 0]}  T={[2 0]} $ since the linear dependence of $ S_1∪ S_2 $ is easy to see.   Continued from prior exercise. What is the interaction between the property of linear independence and the operation of union?  We might conjecture that the union $S∪ T$ of linearly independent sets is linearly independent if and only if their spans have a trivial intersection $span(S) intersection span(T)={0}$. What is wrong with this argument for the `if' direction of that conjecture? ``If the union $S∪ T$ is linearly independent then the only solution to $c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n +d_1vec(t)_1+·s+d_mvec(t)_m =0$ is the trivial one $c_1=0$, ..., $d_m=0$. So any member of the intersection of the spans must be the zero vector because in $c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n =d_1vec(t)_1+·s+d_mvec(t)_m$ each scalar is zero.'' Give an example showing that the conjecture is false. Find linearly independent sets $ S $ and $ T $ so that the union of $ S-(S∩ T)$ and $ T-(S∩ T) $ is linearly independent, but the union $ S∪ T $ is not linearly independent. Characterize when the union of two linearly independent sets is linearly independent, in terms of the intersection of spans.     requires that the vectors $vec(s)_1,...,vec(s)_n,vec(t)_1,...,vec(t)_m$ be distinct. But we could have that the union $S∪ T$ is linearly independent with some $vec(s)_i$ equal to some $vec(t)_j$. One example in $ ℝ^2 $ is these two. $ S={[1 0]}  T={[1 0], [0 1]} $  An example from $ ℝ^2 $ is these sets. $ S={[1 0], [0 1]}  T={[1 0], [1 1]} $ The union of two linearly independent sets $S∪ T$ is linearly independent if and only if their spans of $ S $ and $ T-(S∩ T)$ have a trivial intersection $span(S) intersection span(T-(S∩ T))={0}$. To prove that, assume that $ S $ and $ T $ are linearly independent subsets of some vector space.  For the `only if' direction, assume that the intersection of the spans is trivial $ span(S) intersection span(T-(S∩ T))={0} $. Consider the set $S∪ (T-(S∩ T))=S∪ T$ and consider the linear relationship $c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_nvec(s)_n +d_1vec(t)_1+...+d_mvec(t)_m=0$. Subtracting gives $c_1vec(s)_1+...+c_nvec(s)_n= -d_1vec(t)_1-...-d_mvec(t)_m$. The left side of that equation sums to a vector in $span(S)$, and the right side is a vector in $span(T-(S∩ T))$. Therefore, since the intersection of the spans is trivial, both sides equal the zero vector. Because $S$ is linearly independent, all of the $c$'s are zero. Because $T$ is linearly independent so also is $T-(S∩ T)$ linearly independent, and therefore all of the $d$'s are zero. Thus, the original linear relationship among members of $S∪ T$ only holds if all of the coefficients are zero. Hence, $S∪ T$ is linearly independent.  For the `if' half we can make the same argument in reverse. Suppose that the union $S∪ T$ is linearly independent. Consider a linear relationship among members of $S$ and $T-(S∩ T)$. $c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n +d_1vec(t)_1+·s+d_mvec(t)_m =0$ Note that no $vec(s)_i$ is equal to a $vec(t)_j$ so that is a combination of distinct vectors, as required by . So the only solution is the trivial one $c_1=0$, ..., $d_m=0$. Since any vector $vec(v)$ in the intersection of the spans $span(S) intersection span(T-(S∩ T))$ we can write $vec(v)=c_1vec(s)_1+·s+c_nvec(s)_n =-d_1vec(t)_1-·s-d_mvec(t)_m$, and it must be the zero vector because each scalar is zero.    For ,  fill in the induction for the proof; give an alternate proof that starts with the empty set and builds a sequence of linearly independent subsets of the given finite set until one appears with the same span as the given set.    We do induction on the number of vectors in the finite set $ S $.  The base case is that $S$ has no elements. In this case $S$ is linearly independent and there is nothing to check- a subset of $S$ that has the same span as $S$ is $S$ itself.  For the inductive step assume that the theorem is true for all sets of size $n=0$, $n=1$, ..., $n=k$ in order to prove that it holds when $ S $ has $n=k+1$ elements. If the $k+1$-element set $ S={vec{{s}_0,...,vec{{s}_{{k}} $ is linearly independent then the theorem is trivial, so assume that it is dependent. By there is an $ vec(s)_i $ that is a linear combination of other vectors in $ S $. Define $ S_1=S-{vec{{s}_i} $ and note that $ S_1 $ has the same span as $ S $ by . The set $ S_1 $ has $ k $ elements and so the inductive hypothesis applies to give that it has a linearly independent subset with the same span. That subset of $ S_1 $ is the desired subset of $ S $. Here is a sketch of the argument. We have left out the induction argument details.  If the finite set $ S $ is empty then there is nothing to prove. If $ S={0} $ then the empty subset will do.  Otherwise, take some nonzero vector $ vec(s)_1 in S $ and define $ S_1={vec{{s}_1} $. If $ span(S_1)=span(S) $ then we are finished with this proof by noting that $ S_1 $ is linearly independent.  If not, then there is a nonzero vector $ vec(s)_2 in S-span(S_1) $ (if every $ vec(s) in S $ is in $ span(S_1) $ then $ span(S_1)=span(S) $). Define $ S_2=S_1∪{vec{{s}_2} $. If $ span(S_2)=span(S) $ then we are finished by using to show that $ S_2 $ is linearly independent.  Repeat the last paragraph until a set with a big enough span appears. That must eventually happen because $ S $ is finite, and $ span(S) $ will be reached at worst when we have used every vector from $ S $.    With a some calculation we can get formulas to determine whether or not a set of vectors is linearly independent.  Show that this subset of $ ℝ^2 $ $ {[a c],[b d]} $ is linearly independent if and only if $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $. Show that this subset of $ ℝ^3 $ $ {[a d g], [b e h], [c f i] } $ is linearly independent iff $ aei+bfg+cdh-hfa-idb-gec ≠ 0 $. When is this subset of $ ℝ^3 $ $ {[a d g], [b e h] } $ linearly independent? This is an opinion question:~for a set of four vectors from $ ℝ^4 $, must there be a formula involving the sixteen entries that determines independence of the set? (You needn't produce such a formula, just decide if one exists.)     Assuming first that $ a ≠ 0 $, $ x[a c] +y[b d] =[0 0] $ gives $ $ ax + by = 0 cx + dy = 0 $ for step $-(c/a)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ ax + by = 0 (-(c/a)b+d)y = 0 $ $ which has a solution if and only if $ 0 ≠-(c/a)b+d=(-cb+ad)/d $ (we've assumed in this case that $ a ≠ 0 $, and so back substitution yields a unique solution).  The $ a=0 $ case is also not hard- break it into the $ c ≠ 0 $ and $ c=0 $ subcases and note that in these cases $ ad-bc=0· d-bc $.  Comment. An earlier exercise showed that a two-vector set is linearly dependent if and only if either vector is a scalar multiple of the other. We could also use that to make the calculation. The equation $ c_1[a d g] +c_2[b e h] +c_3[c f i] =[0 0 0] $ expresses a homogeneous linear system. We proceed by writing it in matrix form and applying Gauss's Method.  We first reduce the matrix to upper-triangular. Assume that $ a ≠ 0 $. With that, we can clear down the first column. $ for step $(1/a)ρ_1$ ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 d e f 0 g h i 0 ]) for step $-dρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 0 (ae-bd)/a (af-cd)/a 0 0 (ah-bg)/a (ai-cg)/a 0 ]) $ Then we get a $1$ in the second row, second column entry. (Assuming for the moment that $ ae-bd ≠ 0 $, in order to do the row reduction step.) $ for step $(a/(ae-bd))ρ_2$ ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 0 1 (af-cd)/(ae-bd) 0 0 (ah-bg)/a (ai-cg)/a 0 ]) $ Then, under the assumptions, we perform the row operation $((ah-bg)/a)ρ_2+ρ_3$ to get this. $  ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 0 1 (af-cd)/(ae-bd) 0 0 0 (aei+bgf+cdh-hfa-idb-gec)/(ae-bd) 0 ]) $ Therefore, the original system is nonsingular if and only if the above $ 3,3 $ entry is nonzero (this fraction is defined because of the $ ae-bd ≠ 0 $ assumption). It equals zero if and only if the numerator is zero.  We next worry about the assumptions. First, if $ a ≠ 0 $ but $ ae-bd=0 $ then we swap $ ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 0 0 (af-cd)/a 0 0 (ah-bg)/a (ai-cg)/a 0 ]) for step $ρ_2↔ρ_3$ ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 0 (ah-bg)/a (ai-cg)/a 0 0 0 (af-cd)/a 0 ]) $ and conclude that the system is nonsingular if and only if either $ ah-bg=0 $ or $ af-cd=0 $. That's the same as asking that their product be zero: $ ahaf-ahcd-bgaf+bgcd =0 ahaf-ahcd-bgaf+aegc =0 a(haf-hcd-bgf+egc) =0 $ (in going from the first line to the second we've applied the case assumption that $ae-bd=0$ by substituting $ae$ for $bd$). Since we are assuming that $ a ≠ 0 $, we have that $ haf-hcd-bgf+egc=0 $. With $ae-bd=0$ we can rewrite this to fit the form we need:~in this $ a ≠ 0 $ and $ ae-bd=0 $ case, the given system is nonsingular when $ haf-hcd-bgf+egc-i(ae-bd)=0 $, as required.  The remaining cases have the same character. Do the $ a=0 $ but $ d ≠ 0 $ case and the $ a=0 $ and $ d=0 $ but $ g ≠ 0 $ case by first swapping rows and then going on as above. The $ a=0 $, $ d=0 $, and $ g=0 $ case is easy- a set with a zero vector is linearly dependent, and the formula comes out to equal zero. It is linearly dependent if and only if either vector is a multiple of the other. That is, it is not independent iff $ [a d g]=r·[b e h] or [b e h]=s·[a d g] $ (or both) for some scalars $r$ and $s$. Eliminating $r$ and $s$ in order to restate this condition only in terms of the given letters $a$, $b$, $d$, $e$, $g$, $h$, we have that it is not independent- it is dependent- iff $ ae-bd=ah-gb=dh-ge $. Dependence or independence is a function of the indices, so there is indeed a formula (although at first glance a person might think the formula involves cases: ``if the first component of the first vector is zero then ...'', this guess turns out not to be correct).     Prove that a set of two perpendicular nonzero vectors from $ ℝ^n $ is linearly independent when $ n>1 $. What if $ n=1 $? $ n=0 $? Generalize to more than two vectors.   Recall that two vectors from $ ℝ^n $ are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero.  Assume that $ vec(v) $ and $ vec(w) $ are perpendicular nonzero vectors in $ ℝ^n$, with $ n>1 $. With the linear relationship $ cvec(v)+dvec(w)=0 $, apply $ vec(v) $ to both sides to conclude that $ c·norm{vec(v)}^2+d· 0=0 $. Because $ vec(v) ≠0 $ we have that $ c=0 $. A similar application of $ vec(w) $ shows that $ d=0 $. Two vectors in $ ℝ^1 $ are perpendicular if and only if at least one of them is zero.  We define $ ℝ^0 $ to be a trivial space, and so both $vec(v)$ and $vec(w)$ are the zero vector. The right generalization is to look at a set $ {vec{{v}_1,...,vec{{v}_n}⊆ ℝ^k $ of vectors that are mutually orthogonal (also called pairwise perpendicular):~if $ i ≠ j $ then $ vec(v)_i $ is perpendicular to $ vec(v)_j $. Mimicking the proof of the first item above shows that such a set of nonzero vectors is linearly independent.    Consider the set of functions from the interval $openinterval(-1){1}⊆ ℝ$ to $ ℝ$.  Show that this set is a vector space under the usual operations. Recall the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series: $ 1+x+x^2+·s=1/(1-x) $ for all $ x in(-1..1) $. Why does this not express a dependence inside of the set ${g(x)=1/(1-x),f_0(x)=1,f_1(x)=x,f_2(x)=x^2,...}$ (in the vector space that we are considering)? (Hint. Review the definition of linear combination.) Show that the set in the prior item is linearly independent.  This shows that some vector spaces exist with linearly independent subsets that are infinite.   This check is routine. The summation is infinite (has infinitely many summands). The definition of linear combination involves only finite sums. No nontrivial finite sum of members of $ {g,f_0,f_1,...} $ adds to the zero object:~assume that $ c_0· (1/(1-x))+c_1· 1+...+c_n· x^n=0 $ (any finite sum uses a highest power, here $ n $). Multiply both sides by $ 1-x $ to conclude that each coefficient is zero, because a polynomial describes the zero function only when it is the zero polynomial.    Show that, where $ S $ is a subspace of $ V $, if a subset $T$ of $ S $ is linearly independent in $ S $ then $T$ is also linearly independent in $ V $. Is that `only if'?  It is both `if' and `only if'.  Let $ T $ be a subset of the subspace $ S $ of the vector space $ V $. The assertion that any linear relationship $c_1vec(t)_1+...+c_nvec(t)_n=0$ among members of $ T $ must be the trivial relationship $c_1=0$, ..., $c_n=0$ is a statement that holds in $ S $ if and only if it holds in $ V $, because the subspace $ S $ inherits its addition and scalar multiplication operations from $ V $.          The prior section ends with the observation that a spanning set is minimal when it is linearly independent and a linearly independent set is maximal when it spans the space. So the notions of minimal spanning set and maximal independent set coincide. In this section we will name this idea and study its properties.         A basis for a vector space is a sequence of vectors that is linearly independent and that spans the space.     Because a basis is a sequence, meaning that bases are different if they contain the same elements but in different orders,   we denote it with angle brackets $ sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2,...} $.\@  (A sequence is linearly independent if the multiset consisting of the elements of the sequence in is independent. Similarly, a sequence spans the space if the set of elements of the sequence spans the space.)  For example This is a basis for $ ℝ^2 $. $ [2 4],[1 1] $ It is linearly independent $ c_1[2 4]+c_2[1 1]=[0 0] ⇒ $ 2c_1 + 1c_2 = 0 4c_1 + 1c_2 = 0 $ ⇒ c_1=c_2=0 $ and it spans $ ℝ^2 $. $ $ 2c_1 + 1c_2 = x 4c_1 + 1c_2 = y $ ⇒ c_2=2x-y and c_1=(y-x)/2 $   For example This basis for $ ℝ^2 $ differs from the prior one $ [1 1],[2 4] $ because it is in a different order. The verification that it is a basis is just as in the prior example.   For example The space $ ℝ^2 $ has many bases. Another one is this. $ [1 0],[0 1] $ The verification is easy.     For any $ ℝ^n $ $ stdbasis(_n)=sequence{ [1 0 ... 0], [0 1 ... 0], ..., [0 0 ... 1]} $ is the standard (or natural) basis. We denote these vectors $ vec(e)_1,...,vec(e)_n $.     Calculus books denote $ ℝ^2$'s standard basis vectors as $ vec(\imath) $ and $ vec(\jmath) $ instead of $vec(e)_1$ and $vec(e)_2$ and they denote to $ ℝ^3 $'s standard basis vectors as $ vec(\imath) $, $ vec(\jmath) $, and $ vec(k) $ instead of $vec(e)_1$, $vec(e)_2$, and $vec(e)_3$. Note that $ vec(e)_1 $ means something different in a discussion of $ ℝ^3 $ than it means in a discussion of $ ℝ^2 $.  For example Consider the space $ {a·cos(θ+b)·sin(θ) such that a,b in ℝ} $ of functions of the real variable $θ$. This is a natural basis $ cos(θ), sin(θ)=sequence{1·cos(θ+0)·sin(θ), 0·cos(θ+1)·sin(θ)} $. A more generic basis for this space is $ sequence{cos(θ-)sin(θ), 2cos(θ+3)sin(θ)} $. Verification that these two are bases is .   For example A natural basis for the vector space of cubic polynomials $ polyspace(_3) $ is $ 1,x,x^2,x^3 $. Two other bases for this space are $ x^3,3x^2,6x,6 $ and $ 1,1+x,1+x+x^2,1+x+x^2+x^3 $. Checking that each is linearly independent and spans the space is easy.   For example The trivial space ${0}$ has only one basis, the empty one $.   For example The space of finite-degree polynomials has a basis with infinitely many elements $ 1,x,x^2,... $.   For example We have seen bases before. In the first chapter we described the solution set of homogeneous systems such as this one $ $ x + y - w = 0 z + w = 0 $ $ by parametrizing. $ {[-1 1 0 0]y +[1 0 -1 1]w such that y,w in ℝ } $ Thus the vector space of solutions is the span of a two-element set. This two-vector set is also linearly independent, which is easy to check. Therefore the solution set is a subspace of $ ℝ^4 $ with a basis comprised of these two vectors.   For example Parametrization finds bases for other vector spaces, not just for solution sets of homogeneous systems. To find a basis for this subspace of $matspace(_){N by N}$ $ {([ a b c 0 ]) such that a+b-2c=0} $ we rewrite the condition as $a=-b+2c$. $ {([ -b+2c b c 0 ]) such that b,c in ℝ} ={b([ -1 1 0 0 ])+ c([ 2 0 1 0 ]) such that b,c in ℝ} $ Thus, this is a natural candidate for a basis. $ sequence{([ -1 1 0 0 ]), ([ 2 0 1 0 ]) } $ The above work shows that it spans the space. Linear independence is also easy.   Consider again .        To verify that the set spans the space we looked at linear combinations that total to a member of the space $c_1vec(β)_1+c_2vec(β)_2=(x choose y)$. We only noted in that example that such a combination exists, that for each $x,y$ there exists a $c_1,c_2$, but in fact the calculation also shows that the combination is unique:~$c_1$ must be $(y-x)/2$ and $c_2$ must be $2x-y$.    In any vector space, a subset is a basis if and only if each vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of elements of the subset in one and only one way.    We consider linear combinations to be the same if they have the same summands but in a different order, or if they differ only in the addition or deletion of terms of the form `$ 0·vec(β) $'.     A sequence is a basis if and only if its vectors form a set that spans and that is linearly independent. A subset is a spanning set if and only if each vector in the space is a linear combination of elements of that subset in at least one way. Thus we need only show that a spanning subset is linearly independent if and only if every vector in the space is a linear combination of elements from the subset in at most one way.    Consider two expressions of a vector as a linear combination of the members of the subset. Rearrange the two sums, and if necessary add some $ 0·vec(β)_i $ terms, so that the two sums combine the same $ vec(β) $'s in the same order: $ vec(v)=Linear combination of c{vec(β)} $ and $ vec(v)=Linear combination of d{vec(β)} $. Now $ Linear combination of c{vec(β)}=Linear combination of d{vec(β)} $ holds if and only if $ (c_1-d_1)vec(β)_1+...+(c_n-d_n)vec(β)_n=0 $ holds. So, asserting that each coefficient in the lower equation is zero is the same thing as asserting that $ c_i=d_i $ for each $ i $, that is, that every vector is expressible as a linear combination of the $ vec(β) $'s in a unique way.      In a vector space with basis $B$ the definend{representation of $ vec(v) $ with respect to $ B $} is the column vector of the coefficients used to express $vec(v)$ as a linear combination of the basis vectors: $ rep{vec(v)}{B} = [c_1 c_2 ... c_n] $ where $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ and $ vec(v)=Linear combination of c{vec(β)} $. The $ c $'s are the definend{coordinates of $ vec(v) $ with respect to $ B $} .    For example In $ polyspace(_3) $, with respect to the basis $ B=1,2x,2x^2,2x^3 $, the representation of $ x+x^2 $ is $ Representation of (x+x^2)=[0 1/2 1/2 0]_B $ because $x+x^2=0· 1+(1/2)· 2x+(1/2)· 2x^2+0· 2x^3$. With respect to a different basis $ D=1+x,1-x,x+x^2,x+x^3 $, the representation is different. $ Representation of (x+x^2)=[0 0 1 0]_D $ (When there is more than one basis around, to help keep straight which representation is with respect to which basis we often write it as a subscript on the column vector.)    def:basis requires that a basis be a sequence because without that we couldn't write these coordinates in a fixed order.   For example In $ ℝ^2 $, where $vec(v)=(3 choose 2)$, to find the coordinates of that vector with respect to the basis $ B=sequence{ [1 1], [0 2] } $ we solve $ c_1[1 1] +c_2[0 2] = [3 2] $ and get that $c_1=3$ and $c_2=-1/2$. $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=[3 -1/2] $    This use of column notation and the term `coordinate' has both a disadvantage and an advantage. The disadvantage is that representations look like vectors from $ ℝ^n $, which can be confusing when the vector space is $ ℝ^n$, as in the prior example. We must infer the intent from the context. For example, the phrase `in $ ℝ^2 $, where $vec(v)=(3 choose 2)$' refers to the plane vector that, when in canonical position, ends at $ (3,2) $. And in the end of that example, although we've omitted a subscript $ B $ from the column, that the right side is a representation is clear from the context.  The advantage of the notation and the term is that they generalize the familiar case:~in $ ℝ^n $ and with respect to the standard basis $ stdbasis(_n) $, the vector starting at the origin and ending at $ (v_1,...,v_n) $ has this representation. $ Representation of ([v_1 ... v_n]) = [v_1 ... v_n]_{stdbasis(_n)} $   Our main use of representations will come later but the definition appears here because the fact that every vector is a linear combination of basis vectors in a unique way is a crucial property of bases, and also to help make a point. For calculation of coordinates among other things, we shall restrict our attention to spaces with bases having only finitely many elements. That will start in the next subsection.   Decide if each is a basis for $polyspace(_2)$.  $x^2-x+1, 2x+1, 2x-1$ $x+x^2, x-x^2$    This is a basis for $polyspace(_2)$. To show that it spans the space we consider a generic $a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0 inpolyspace(_2)$ and look for scalars $c_1, c_2, c_3 in ℝ$ such that $a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0=c_1·(x^2-x+1) +c_2·(2x+1) +c_3(2x-1)$. Gauss's Method on the linear system $ $ c_1 = a_2 2c_2 + 2c_3 = a_1 c_2 - c_3 = a_0 $ $ shows that given the $a_i$'s we can compute the $c_j$'s as $c_1=a_2$, $c_2=(1/4)a_1+(1/2)a_0$, and $c_3=(1/4)a_1-(1/2)a_0$. Thus each element of $polyspace(_2)$ is a combination of the given three.  To prove that the set of the given three is linearly independent we can set up the equation $0x^2+0x+0=c_1·(x^2-x+1) +c_2·(2x+1) +c_3(2x-1)$ and solve, and it will give that $c_1=0$, $c_2=0$, and $c_3=0$. Or, we can instead observe that the solution in the prior paragraph is unique, and cite . This is not a basis. It does not span the space since no combination of the two $c_1· (x+x^2) +c_2· (x-x^2)$ will sum to the polynomial $3 inpolyspace(_2)$.    Decide if each is a basis for $ ℝ^3 $.  $ sequence{ [1 2 3], [3 2 1], [0 0 1]} $ $ sequence{ [1 2 3], [3 2 1]} $ $ sequence{ [0 2 -1], [1 1 1], [2 5 0]} $ $ sequence{ [0 2 -1], [1 1 1], [1 3 0]} $   By , each is a basis if and only if we can express each vector in the space in a unique way as a linear combination of the given vectors.  Yes this is a basis. The relation $ c_1[1 2 3] +c_2[3 2 1] +c_3[0 0 1] =[x y z] $ gives $ ([ 1 3 0 x 2 2 0 y 3 1 1 z ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 3 0 x 0 -4 0 -2x+y 0 0 1 x-2y+z ]) $ which has the unique solution $ c_3=x-2y+z $, $ c_2=x/2-y/4 $, and $ c_1=-x/2+3y/4 $. This is not a basis. Setting it up as in the prior item $ c_1[1 2 3] +c_2[3 2 1] =[x y z] $ gives a linear system whose solution $ ([ 1 3 x 2 2 y 3 1 z ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 3 x 0 -4 -2x+y 0 0 x-2y+z ]) $ is possible if and only if the three-tall vector's components $x$, $y$, and $z$ satisfy $x-2y+z=0$. For instance, we can find the coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ that work when $x=1$, $y=1$, and $z=1$. However, there are no $c$'s that work for $x=1$, $y=1$, and $z=2$. Thus this is not a basis; it does not span the space. Yes, this is a basis. Setting up the relationship leads to this reduction $ ([ 0 1 2 x 2 1 5 y -1 1 0 z ]) for step $ρ_1 ↔ ρ_3$ repeat step $2ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-(1/3)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ -1 1 0 z 0 3 5 y+2z 0 0 1/3 x-y/3-2z/3 ]) $ which has a unique solution for each triple of components $x$, $y$, and $z$. No, this is not a basis. The reduction $ ([ 0 1 1 x 2 1 3 y -1 1 0 z ]) for step $ρ_1 ↔ ρ_3$ repeat step $2ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $(-1/3)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ -1 1 0 z 0 3 3 y+2z 0 0 0 x-y/3-2z/3 ]) $ which does not have a solution for each triple $x$, $y$, and $z$. Instead, the span of the given set includes only those three-tall vectors where $ x=y/3+2z/3 $.    Represent the vector with respect to the basis.  $ [1 2] $, $ B=[1 1],[-1 1]⊆ ℝ^2 $ $ x^2+x^3 $, $ D=1,1+x,1+x+x^2,1+x+x^2+x^3⊆polyspace(_3) $ $ [0 -1 0 1] $, $ stdbasis(_4)⊆ ℝ^4 $    We solve $ c_1[1 1] +c_2[-1 1] =[1 2] $ with $ ([ 1 -1 1 1 1 2 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 -1 1 0 2 1 ]) $ and conclude that $ c_2=1/2 $ and so $ c_1=3/2 $. Thus, the representation is this. $ Representation of ([1 2])=[3/2 1/2]_B $ The relationship $c_1·(1)+c_2·(1+x)+c_3·(1+x+x^2)+c_4·(1+x+x^2+x^3) =x^2+x^3$ is easily solved by eye to give that $c_4=1$, $c_3=0$, $c_2=-1$, and $c_1=0$. $ Representation of (x^2+x^3)=[0 -1 0 1]_D $ $ Representation of ([0 -1 0 1]) =[0 -1 0 1]_{stdbasis(_4)} $   Represent the vector with respect to each of the two bases. $ vec(v)=[3 -1]  B_1=[1 -1], [1 1], B_2=[1 2], [1 3] $  Solving $ [3 -1]=[1 -1]· c_1 +[1 1]· c_2 $ gives $c_1=2$ and~$c_2=1$. $ Representation of ([3 -1]) =[2 1]_{B_1} $ Similarly, solving $ [3 -1]=[1 2]· c_1 +[1 3]· c_2 $ gives this. $ Representation of ([3 -1]) =[10 -7]_{B_2} $   Find a basis for $ polyspace(_2) $, the space of all quadratic polynomials. Must any such basis contain a polynomial of each degree:~degree zero, degree one, and degree two?  A natural basis is $ 1,x,x^2 $. There are bases for $polyspace(_2)$ that do not contain any polynomials of degree one or degree zero. One is $ 1+x+x^2,x+x^2,x^2 $. (Every basis has at least one polynomial of degree two, though.)   Find a basis for the solution set of this system. $ $ x_1 - 4x_2 + 3x_3 - x_4 = 0 2x_1 - 8x_2 + 6x_3 - 2x_4 = 0 $ $  The reduction $ ([ 1 -4 3 -1 0 2 -8 6 -2 0 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 -4 3 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ gives that the only condition is that $x_1=4x_2-3x_3+x_4$. The solution set is $ {[4x_2-3x_3+x_4 x_2 x_3 x_4] such that x_2,x_3,x_4 in ℝ} ={x_2[4 1 0 0] +x_3[-3 0 1 0] +x_4[1 0 0 1] such that x_2,x_3,x_4 in ℝ} $ and so the obvious candidate for the basis is this. $ sequence{[4 1 0 0], [-3 0 1 0], [1 0 0 1] } $ We've shown that this spans the space, and showing it is also linearly independent is routine.   Find a basis for $ matspace(_){N by N} $, the space of $ N by N $ matrices.  There are many bases. This is a natural one. $ sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 1 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 1 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } $   Find a basis for each.  The subspace ${a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0 such that a_2-2a_1=a_0}$ of $polyspace(_2)$ The space of three-wide row vectors whose first and second components add to zero This subspace of the $N by N$ matrices $ {([ a b 0 c ]) such that c-2b=0} $   For each item, many answers are possible.  One way to proceed is to parametrize by expressing the $a_2$ as a combination of the other two $a_2=2a_1+a_0$. Then $a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$ is $(2a_1+a_0)x^2+a_1x+a_0$ and $ {(2a_1+a_0)x^2+a_1x+a_0 such that a_1,a_0 in ℝ} ={a_1·(2x^2+x)+a_0·(x^2+1) such that a_1,a_0 in ℝ} $ suggests $2x^2+x,x^2+1$. This only shows that it spans, but checking that it is linearly independent is routine. Parametrize ${[a b c] such that a+b=0}$ to get ${[-b b c] such that b,c in ℝ}$, which suggests using the sequence $[-1 1 0],[0 0 1]$. We've shown that it spans, and checking that it is linearly independent is easy. Rewriting $ {([ a b 0 2b ]) such that a,b in ℝ} ={a·([ 1 0 0 0 ]) +b·([ 0 1 0 2 ]) such that a,b in ℝ} $ suggests this for the basis. $ sequence{([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 1 0 2 ])} $   Find a basis for each space, and verify that it is a basis.   The subspace $M={a+bx+cx^2+dx^3 such that a-2b+c-d=0}$ of $polyspace(_3)$. This subspace of $matspace(_){N by N}$. $ W={ ([ a b c d ]) such that a-c=0} $      Parametrize $a-2b+c-d=0$ as $a=2b-c+d$, $b=b$, $c=c$, and~$d=d$ to get this description of $M$ as the span of a set of three vectors. $ M={ (2+x)· b+(-1+x^2)· c+(1+x^3)· d such that b,c,d in ℝ } $ To show that this three-vector set is a basis, what remains is to verify that it is linearly independent. $ 0+0x+0x^2+0x^3=(2+x)· c_1+(-1+x^2)· c_2+(1+x^3)· c_3 $ From the $x$~terms we see that $c_1=0$. From the $x^2$~terms we see that $c_2=0$. The $x^3$~terms give that $c_3=0$.  First parametrize the description (note that the fact that $b$ and~$d$ are not mentioned in the description of $W$ does not mean they are zero or absent, it means that they are unrestricted). $ W={ ([ 0 1 0 0 ])· b + ([ 1 0 1 0 ])· c + ([ 0 0 0 1 ])· d such that b,c,d in ℝ} $ That gives $W$ as the span of a three element set. We will be done if we show that the set is linearly independent. $ ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) = ([ 0 1 0 0 ])· c_1 + ([ 1 0 1 0 ])· c_2 + ([ 0 0 0 1 ])· c_3 $ Using the upper right entries we see that $c_1=0$. The upper left entries give that $c_2=0$, and the lower left entries show that $c_3=0$.    Check .  We will show that the second is a basis; the first is similar. We will show this straight from the definition of a basis, because this example appears before .  To see that it is linearly independent, we set up $ c_1·(cos(θ-)sin(θ))+c_2·(2cos(θ+3)sin(θ))= 0cos(θ+0)sin(θ) $. Taking $ θ=0 $ and $ θ=π/2 $ gives this system $ $ c_1· 1 + c_2· 2 = 0 c_1· (-1) + c_2· 3 = 0 $ for step $ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ c_1 + 2c_2 = 0 + 5c_2 = 0 $ $ which shows that $c_1=0$ and $c_2=0$.  The calculation for span is also easy; for any $x,y in ℝ$, we have that $ c_1·(cos(θ-)sin(θ))+c_2·(2cos(θ+3)sin(θ))= xcos(θ+y)sin(θ) $ gives that $ c_2=x/5+y/5 $ and that $ c_1=3x/5-2y/5 $, and so the span is the entire space.   Find the span of each set and then find a basis for that span.  ${1+x,1+2x}$ in $polyspace(_2)$ ${2-2x,3+4x^2}$ in $polyspace(_2)$    Asking which $a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2$ can be expressed as $c_1· (1+x)+c_2· (1+2x)$ gives rise to three linear equations, describing the coefficients of $x^2$, $x$, and the constants. $ $ c_1 + c_2 = a_0 c_1 + 2c_2 = a_1 0 = a_2 $ $ Gauss's Method with back-substitution shows, provided that $a_2=0$, that $c_2=-a_0+a_1$ and $c_1=2a_0-a_1$. Thus, with $a_2=0$, we can compute appropriate $c_1$ and $c_2$ for any $a_0$ and $a_1$. So the span is the entire set of linear polynomials ${a_0+a_1x such that a_0,a_1 in ℝ}$. Parametrizing that set ${a_0· 1+a_1· x such that a_0,a_1 in ℝ}$ suggests a basis $1,x$ (we've shown that it spans; checking linear independence is easy). With $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 =c_1·(2-2x)+c_2·(3+4x^2) =(2c_1+3c_2)+(-2c_1)x+(4c_2)x^2 $ we get this system. $ $ 2c_1 + 3c_2 = a_0 -2c_1 = a_1 4c_2 = a_2 $ for step $ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $(-4/3)ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ 2c_1 + 3c_2 = a_0 3c_2 = a_0+a_1 0 = (-4/3)a_0-(4/3)a_1+a_2 $ $ Thus, the only quadratic polynomials $a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2$ with associated $c$'s are the ones such that $0=(-4/3)a_0-(4/3)a_1+a_2$. Hence the span is this. $ {(-a_1+(3/4)a_2)+a_1x+a_2x^2 such that a_1,a_2 in ℝ} $ Parametrizing gives ${a_1· (-1+x)+a_2· ((3/4)+x^2) such that a_1,a_2 in ℝ}$, which suggests $-1+x,(3/4)+x^2$ (checking that it is linearly independent is routine).    Find a basis for each of these subspaces of the space $polyspace(_3)$ of cubic polynomials.  The subspace of cubic polynomials $p(x)$ such that $p(7)=0$ The subspace of polynomials $p(x)$ such that $p(7)=0$ and $p(5)=0$ The subspace of polynomials $p(x)$ such that $p(7)=0$, $p(5)=0$, and~$p(3)=0$ The space of polynomials $p(x)$ such that $p(7)=0$, $p(5)=0$, $p(3)=0$, and~$p(1)=0$    The subspace is this. $ {a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 such that a_0+7a_1+49a_2+343a_3=0 } $ Rewriting $a_0=-7a_1-49a_2-343a_3$ gives this. $ {(-7a_1-49a_2-343a_3)+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 such that a_1,a_2,a_3 in ℝ } $ On breaking out the parameters, this suggests $ -7+x,-49+x^2,-343+x^3 $ for the basis (it is easily verified). The given subspace is the collection of cubics $p(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3$ such that $a_0+7a_1+49a_2+343a_3=0$ and $a_0+5a_1+25a_2+125a_3=0$. Gauss's Method $ $ a_0 + 7a_1 + 49a_2 + 343a_3 = 0 a_0 + 5a_1 + 25a_2 + 125a_3 = 0 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ a_0 + 7a_1 + 49a_2 + 343a_3 = 0 -2a_1 - 24a_2 - 218a_3 = 0 $ $ gives that $a_1=-12a_2-109a_3$ and that $a_0=35a_2+420a_3$. Rewriting $(35a_2+420a_3)+(-12a_2-109a_3)x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3$ as $a_2·(35-12x+x^2)+a_3·(420-109x+x^3)$ suggests this for a basis $35-12x+x^2,420-109x+x^3$. The above shows that it spans the space. Checking it is linearly independent is routine. (Comment. A worthwhile check is to verify that both polynomials in the basis have both seven and five as roots.) Here there are three conditions on the cubics, that $a_0+7a_1+49a_2+343a_3=0$, that $a_0+5a_1+25a_2+125a_3=0$, and that $a_0+3a_1+9a_2+27a_3=0$. Gauss's Method $ $ a_0 + 7a_1 + 49a_2 + 343a_3 = 0 a_0 + 5a_1 + 25a_2 + 125a_3 = 0 a_0 + 3a_1 + 9a_2 + 27a_3 = 0 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ a_0 + 7a_1 + 49a_2 + 343a_3 = 0 -2a_1 - 24a_2 - 218a_3 = 0 8a_2 + 120a_3 = 0 $ $ yields the single free variable $a_3$, with $a_2=-15a_3$, $a_1=71a_3$, and $a_0=-105a_3$. The parametrization is this. $ {(-105a_3)+(71a_3)x+(-15a_3)x^2+(a_3)x^3 such that a_3 in ℝ} = {a_3·(-105+71x-15x^2+x^3) such that a_3 in ℝ} $ Therefore, a natural candidate for the basis is $-105+71x-15x^2+x^3$. It spans the space by the work above. It is clearly linearly independent because it is a one-element set (with that single element not the zero object of the space). Thus, any cubic through the three points $(7,0)$, $(5,0)$, and $(3,0)$ is a multiple of this one. (Comment. As in the prior question, a worthwhile check is to verify that plugging seven, five, and three into this polynomial yields zero each time.) This is the trivial subspace of $polyspace(_3)$. Thus, the basis is empty $$.  Remark. Alternatively, we could have derived the polynomial in the third item by multiplying out $(x-7)(x-5)(x-3)$.   We've seen that the result of reordering a basis can be another basis. Must it be?  Yes. Linear independence and span are unchanged by reordering.   Can a basis contain a zero vector?  No linearly independent set contains a zero vector.   Let $ sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2,vec(β)_3} $ be a basis for a vector space.  Show that $ sequence{c_1vec(β)_1,c_2vec(β)_2,c_3vec(β)_3} $ is a basis when $ c_1, c_2, c_3 ≠ 0 $. What happens when at least one $ c_i $ is $0$? Prove that $ sequence{vec(α)_1,vec(α)_2,vec(α)_3} $ is a basis where $ vec(α)_i=vec(β)_1+vec(β)_i $.    To show that it is linearly independent, note that if $ d_1(c_1vec(β)_1)+d_2(c_2vec(β)_2)+d_3(c_3vec(β)_3) =0 $ then $ (d_1c_1)vec(β)_1+(d_2c_2)vec(β)_2+(d_3c_3)vec(β)_3 =0 $, which in turn implies that each $ d_ic_i $ is zero. But with $ c_i ≠ 0 $ that means that each $ d_i $ is zero. Showing that it spans the space is much the same; because $sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2,vec(β)_3}$ is a basis, and so spans the space, we can for any $vec(v)$ write $ vec(v)=d_1vec(β)_1+d_2vec(β)_2+d_3vec(β)_3 $, and then $ vec(v)=(d_1/c_1)(c_1vec(β)_1) +(d_2/c_2)(c_2vec(β)_2)+(d_3/c_3)(c_3vec(β)_3) $.  If any of the scalars are zero then the result is not a basis, because it is not linearly independent. Showing that $sequence{2vec(β)_1,vec(β)_1+vec(β)_2, vec(β)_1+vec(β)_3}$ is linearly independent is easy. To show that it spans the space, assume that $ vec(v)=d_1vec(β)_1+d_2vec(β)_2+d_3vec(β)_3 $. Then, we can represent the same $ vec(v) $ with respect to $ sequence{2vec(β)_1,vec(β)_1+vec(β)_2, vec(β)_1+vec(β)_3} $ in this way $vec(v)=(1/2)(d_1-d_2-d_3)(2vec(β)_1) +d_2(vec(β)_1+vec(β)_2)+d_3(vec(β)_1+vec(β)_3)$.    Find one vector $vec(v)$ that will make each into a basis for the space.  $sequence{[1 1],vec(v)}$ in $ ℝ^2$ $sequence{[1 1 0], [0 1 0],vec(v)}$ in $ ℝ^3$ $sequence{x,1+x^2,vec(v)}$ in $polyspace(_2)$   Each forms a linearly independent set if we omit $vec(v)$. To preserve linear independence, we must expand the span of each. That is, we must determine the span of each (leaving $vec(v)$ out), and then pick a $vec(v)$ lying outside of that span. Then to finish, we must check that the result spans the entire given space. Those checks are routine.  Any vector that is not a multiple of the given one, that is, any vector that is not on the line $y=x$ will do here. One is $vec(v)=vec(e)_1$. By inspection, we notice that the vector $vec(e)_3$ is not in the span of the set of the two given vectors. The check that the resulting set is a basis for $ ℝ^3$ is routine. For any member of the span ${c_1·(x)+c_2·(1+x^2) such that c_1,c_2 in ℝ}$, the coefficient of $x^2$ equals the constant term. So we expand the span if we add a quadratic without this property, say, $vec(v)=1-x^2$. The check that the result is a basis for $polyspace(_2)$ is easy.    Where $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n } $ is a basis, show that in this equation $ c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_kvec(β)_k = c_{k+1}vec(β)_{k+1}+...+c_nvec(β)_n $ each of the $ c_i $'s is zero. Generalize.  To show that each scalar is zero, simply subtract $ c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_kvec(β)_k -c_{k+1}vec(β)_{k+1}-...-c_nvec(β)_n=0 $. The obvious generalization is that in any equation involving only the $ vec(β) $'s, and in which each $ vec(β) $ appears only once, each scalar is zero. For instance, an equation with a combination of the even-indexed basis vectors (i.e., $vec(β)_2$, $vec(β)_4$, etc.) on the right and the odd-indexed basis vectors on the left also gives the conclusion that all of the coefficients are zero.   A basis contains some of the vectors from a vector space; can it contain them all?  No; no linearly independent set contains the zero vector.   shows that, with respect to a basis, every linear combination is unique. If a subset is not a basis, can linear combinations be not unique? If so, must they be?  Here is a subset of $ ℝ^2$ that is not a basis, and two different linear combinations of its elements that sum to the same vector. $ {[1 2],[2 4]}  2·[1 2]+0·[2 4] =0·[1 2]+1·[2 4] $ Thus, when a subset is not a basis, it can be the case that its linear combinations are not unique.  But just because a subset is not a basis does not imply that its combinations must be not unique. For instance, this set $ {[1 2]} $ does have the property that $ c_1·[1 2] = c_2·[1 2] $ implies that $c_1=c_2$. The idea here is that this subset fails to be a basis because it fails to span the space; the proof of the theorem establishes that linear combinations are unique if and only if the subset is linearly independent.   A square matrix is symmetric  if for all indices $ i $ and $ j $, entry $ i,j $ equals entry $ j,i $.  Find a basis for the vector space of symmetric $ N by N $ matrices. Find a basis for the space of symmetric $ N by N $ matrices. Find a basis for the space of symmetric $ N by N $ matrices.    Describing the vector space as $ {([ a b b c ]) such that a,b,c in ℝ} $ suggests this for a basis. $ sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]), ([ 0 1 1 0 ]) } $ Verification is easy. This is one possible basis. $ sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]), ([ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ]) } $ As in the prior two questions, we can form a basis from two kinds of matrices. First are the matrices with a single one on the diagonal and all other entries zero (there are $ n $ of those matrices). Second are the matrices with two opposed off-diagonal entries are ones and all other entries are zeros. (That is, all entries in $M$ are zero except that $m_{i,j}$ and $m_{j,i}$ are one.)    We can show that every basis for $ ℝ^3$ contains the same number of vectors.  Show that no linearly independent subset of $ ℝ^3$ contains more than three vectors. Show that no spanning subset of $ ℝ^3$ contains fewer than three vectors. Hint: recall how to calculate the span of a set and show that this method cannot yield all of $ ℝ^3$ when we apply it to fewer than three vectors.    Any four vectors from $ ℝ^3$ are linearly related because the vector equation $ c_1[x_1 y_1 z_1] +c_2[x_2 y_2 z_2] +c_3[x_3 y_3 z_3] +c_4[x_4 y_4 z_4] =[0 0 0] $ gives rise to a linear system $ $ x_1c_1 + x_2c_2 + x_3c_3 + x_4c_4 = 0 y_1c_1 + y_2c_2 + y_3c_3 + y_4c_4 = 0 z_1c_1 + z_2c_2 + z_3c_3 + z_4c_4 = 0 $ $ that is homogeneous (and so has a solution) and has four unknowns but only three equations, and therefore has nontrivial solutions. (Of course, this argument applies to any subset of $ ℝ^3$ with four or more vectors.) We shall do just the two-vector case. Given $x_1$, ..., $z_2$, $ S={[x_1 y_1 z_1], [x_2 y_2 z_2]} $ to decide which vectors $ [x y z] $ are in the span of $S$, set up $ c_1[x_1 y_1 z_1] +c_2[x_2 y_2 z_2] =[x y z] $ and row reduce the resulting system. $ $ x_1c_1 + x_2c_2 = x y_1c_1 + y_2c_2 = y z_1c_1 + z_2c_2 = z $ $ There are two variables $c_1$ and $c_2$ but three equations, so when Gauss's Method finishes, on the bottom row there will be some relationship of the form $0=m_1x+m_2y+m_3z$. Hence, vectors in the span of the two-element set $S$ must satisfy some restriction. Hence the span is not all of $ ℝ^3$.    One of the exercises in the Subspaces subsection shows that the set $ {[x y z] such that x+y+z=1} $ is a vector space under these operations. $ [x_1 y_1 z_1]+[x_2 y_2 z_2] =[x_1+x_2-1 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2]  r[x y z]=[rx-r+1 ry rz] $ Find a basis.  We have (using these odball operations with care) $ {[1-y-z y z] such that y,z in ℝ} ={[-y+1 y 0] +[-z+1 0 z] such that y,z in ℝ} ={y·[0 1 0] +z·[0 0 1] such that y,z in ℝ} $ and so a natural candidate for a basis is this. $ [0 1 0],[0 0 1] $ To check linear independence we set up $ c_1[0 1 0]+c_2[0 0 1] =[1 0 0] $ (the vector on the right is the zero object in this space). That yields the linear system $ $ (-c_1+1) + (-c_2+1) - 1 = 1 c_1 = 0 c_2 = 0 $ $ with only the solution $c_1=0$ and $c_2=0$. Checking the span is similar.                  The previous subsection defines a basis of a vector space and shows that a space can have many different bases.   So we cannot talk about ``the'' basis for a vector space. True, some vector spaces have bases that strike us as more natural than others, for instance, $ ℝ^2$'s basis $stdbasis(_2)$  or $polyspace(_2)$'s basis $1,x,x^2$. But for the vector space ${a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0 such that 2a_2-a_0=a_1}$, no particular basis leaps out at us as the natural one. We cannot, in general, associate with a space any single basis that best describes it.  We can however find something about the bases that is uniquely associated with the space. This subsection shows that any two bases for a space have the same number of elements. So with each space we can associate a number, the number of vectors in any of its bases.  Before we start, we first limit our attention to spaces where at least one basis has only finitely many members.    A vector space is finite-dimensional  if it has a basis with only finitely many vectors.    One space that is not finite-dimensional is the set of polynomials with real coefficients ; this space is not spanned by any finite subset since that would contain a polynomial of largest degree but this space has polynomials of all degrees. Such spaces are interesting and important but we will focus in a different direction. From now on we will study only finite-dimensional vector spaces. In the rest of this book we shall take `vector space' to mean `finite-dimensional vector space'.   One reason for sticking to finite-dimensional spaces is so that the representation of a vector with respect to a basis is a finitely-tall vector and we can easily write it. Another reason is that the statement `any infinite-dimensional vector space has a basis' is equivalent to a statement called the Axiom of Choice and so covering this would move us far past this book's scope. (A discussion of the Axiom of Choice is in the Frequently Asked Questions list for , and another accessible one is .)    To prove the main theorem we shall use a technical result, the Exchange Lemma. We first illustrate it with an example.  For example Here is a basis for $ ℝ^3$ and a vector given as a linear combination of members of that basis. $ B=sequence{[1 0 0], [1 1 0], [0 0 2]}  [1 2 0] =(-1)·[1 0 0] +2[1 1 0] +0·[0 0 2] $ Two of the basis vectors have non-zero coefficients. Pick one, for instance the first. Replace it with the vector that we've expressed as the combination $ B̂=sequence{[1 2 0], [1 1 0], [0 0 2]} $ and the result is another basis for $ ℝ^3 $.   [Exchange Lemma]  Assume that $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ is a basis for a vector space, and that for the vector $ vec(v) $ the relationship $ vec(v)=Linear combination of c{vec(β)} $ has $ c_i ≠ 0 $. Then exchanging $ vec(β)_i $ for $ vec(v) $ yields another basis for the space.      Call the outcome of the exchange $ B̂=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_{i-1},vec(v), vec(β)_{i+1},...,vec(β)_n} $.  We first show that $B̂$ is linearly independent. Any relationship $ d_1vec(β)_1+...+d_ivec(v)+...+d_nvec(β)_n=0 $ among the members of $B̂$, after substitution for $vec(v)$, $ d_1vec(β)_1+... +d_i·(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_ivec(β)_i+...+c_nvec(β)_n) +...+d_nvec(β)_n =0 $ gives a linear relationship among the members of $B$. The basis $B$ is linearly independent so the coefficient $d_ic_i$ of $vec(β)_i$ is zero. Because we assumed that $c_i$ is nonzero, $d_i=0$. Using this in equation~$(*)$ gives that all of the other $d$'s are also zero. Therefore $B̂$ is linearly independent.    We finish by showing that $B̂$ has the same span as $B$. Half of this argument, that $span(smash(B)̂)⊆span(B)$, is easy; we can write any member $d_1vec(β)_1+...+d_ivec(v)+...+d_nvec(β)_n$ of $span(smash(B)̂)$ as $ d_1vec(β)_1+... +d_i·(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n) +...+d_nvec(β)_n $, which is a linear combination of linear combinations of members of $B$, and hence is in $span(B)$. For the $span(B)⊆span(smash(B)̂)$ half of the argument, recall that if $vec(v)=c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n$ with $c_i ≠ 0$ then we can rearrange the equation to $vec(β)_i=(-c_1/c_i)vec(β)_1+...+(1/c_i)vec(v)+... +(-c_n/c_i)vec(β)_n$. Now, consider any member $d_1vec(β)_1+...+d_ivec(β)_i+...+d_nvec(β)_n$ of $span(B)$, substitute for $vec(β)_i$ its expression as a linear combination of the members of $B̂$, and recognize, as in the first half of this argument, that the result is a linear combination of linear combinations of members of $B̂$, and hence is in $span(smash(B)̂)$.      In any finite-dimensional vector space, all bases have the same number of elements.      Fix a vector space with at least one finite basis. Choose, from among all of this space's bases, one $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ of minimal size. We will show that any other basis $ D=smash{sequence{vec(δ)_1,vec(δ)_2,...}} $ also has the same number of members, $n$. Because $ B $ has minimal size, $ D $ has no fewer than $ n $ vectors. We will argue that it cannot have more than $ n $ vectors.    The basis $ B $ spans the space and $ vec(δ)_1 $ is in the space, so $ vec(δ)_1 $ is a nontrivial linear combination of elements of $ B $. By the Exchange Lemma, we can swap $ vec(δ)_1 $ for a vector from $ B $, resulting in a basis $ B_1 $, where one element is $ vec(δ)_1 $ and all of the $ n-1 $ other elements are $ vec(β) $'s.    The prior paragraph forms the basis step for an induction argument. The inductive step starts with a basis $ B_k $ (for $ 1≤ k<n $) containing $ k $ members of $ D $ and $ n-k $ members of $ B $. We know that $ D $ has at least $ n $ members so there is a $ vec(δ)_{k+1} $. Represent it as a linear combination of elements of $ B_k $. The key point:~in that representation, at least one of the nonzero scalars must be associated with a $ vec(β)_i $ or else that representation would be a nontrivial linear relationship among elements of the linearly independent set $ D $. Exchange $ vec(δ)_{k+1} $ for $ vec(β)_i $ to get a new basis $ B_{k+1} $ with one $ vec(δ) $ more and one $ vec(β) $ fewer than the previous basis $ B_k $.    Repeat that until no $ vec(β) $'s remain, so that $ B_n $ contains $vec(δ)_1,...,vec(δ)_n$. Now, $ D $ cannot have more than these $ n $ vectors because any $ vec(δ)_{n+1} $ that remains would be in the span of $ B_n $ (since it is a basis) and hence would be a linear combination of the other $vec(δ)$'s, contradicting that $D$ is linearly independent.      The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any of its bases.    For example Any basis for $ ℝ^n $ has $ n $ vectors since the standard basis $ stdbasis(_n) $ has $ n $ vectors. Thus, this definition of `dimension' generalizes the most familiar use of term, that $ ℝ^n$ is $n$-dimensional.   For example The space $ polyspace(_n) $ of polynomials of degree at most $n$ has dimension $ n+1 $. We can show this by exhibiting any basis- $1,x,...,x^n$ comes to mind- and counting its members.   For example The space of functions ${a·cos(θ+b)·sin(θ) such that a,b in ℝ}$ of the real variable $θ$ has dimension~$2$ since this space has the basis $cos(θ),sin(θ)$.   For example A trivial space is zero-dimensional since its basis is empty.   Again, although we sometimes say `finite-dimensional' for emphasis, from now on we take all vector spaces to be finite-dimensional. So in the next result the word `space' means `finite-dimensional vector space'.    No linearly independent set can have a size greater than the dimension of the enclosing space.      The proof of never uses that $ D $ spans the space, only that it is linearly independent.     For example Recall the diagram from Example I. showing the subspaces of $ ℝ^3 $. Each subspace is described with a minimal spanning set, a basis. The whole space has a basis with three members, the plane subspaces have bases with two members, the line subspaces have bases with one member, and the trivial subspace has a basis with zero members. We could not in that section show that these are $ ℝ^3 $'s only subspaces. We can show it now. The prior corollary proves that the only subspaces of $ ℝ^3 $ are either three-, two-, one-, or zero-dimensional. There are no subspaces somehow, say, between lines and planes.      Any linearly independent set can be expanded to make a basis.      If a linearly independent set is not already a basis then it must not span the space. Adding to the set a vector that is not in the span will preserve linear independence by Lemma II.. Keep adding until the resulting set does span the space, which the prior corollary shows will happen after only a finite number of steps.      Any spanning set can be shrunk to a basis.      Call the spanning set $ S $. If $ S $ is empty then it is already a basis (the space must be a trivial space). If $ S={0} $ then it can be shrunk to the empty basis, thereby making it linearly independent, without changing its span.  Otherwise, $S$ contains a vector $vec(s)_1$ with $vec(s)_1 ≠0$ and we can form a basis $ B_1=sequence{vec(s)_1} $. If $ span(B_1)=span(S) $ then we are done. If not then there is a $ vec(s)_2 inspan(S) $ such that $ vec(s)_2 not inspan(B_1) $. Let $ B_2=sequence{vec(s)_1,vec(s_2)} $; by Lemma~II. this is linearly independent so if $ span(B_2)=span(S) $ then we are done.  We can repeat this process until the spans are equal, which must happen in at most finitely many steps.       In an $ n $-dimensional space, a set composed of $ n $ vectors is linearly independent if and only if it spans the space.      First we will show that a subset with $ n $ vectors is linearly independent if and only if it is a basis. The `if' is trivially true- bases are linearly independent. `Only if' holds because a linearly independent set can be expanded to a basis, but a basis has $ n $ elements, so this expansion is actually the set that we began with.  To finish, we will show that any subset with $ n $ vectors spans the space if and only if it is a basis. Again, `if' is trivial. `Only if' holds because any spanning set can be shrunk to a basis, but a basis has $ n $ elements and so this shrunken set is just the one we started with.    The main result of this subsection, that all of the bases in a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of elements, is the single most important result in this book. As shows, it describes what vector spaces and subspaces there can be.  One immediate consequence brings us back to when we considered the two things that could be meant by the term `minimal spanning set'. At that point we defined `minimal' as linearly independent but we noted that another reasonable interpretation of the term is that a spanning set is `minimal' when it has the fewest number of elements of any set with the same span. Now that we have shown that all bases have the same number of elements, we know that the two senses of `minimal' are equivalent.    [{m Assume that all spaces are finite-dimensional unless otherwise stated.}]  Find a basis for, and the dimension of, $ polyspace(_2) $.  One basis is $ 1,x,x^2 $, and so the dimension is three.   Find a basis for, and the dimension of, the solution set of this system. $ $ x_1 - 4x_2 + 3x_3 - x_4 = 0 2x_1 - 8x_2 + 6x_3 - 2x_4 = 0 $ $  The solution set is $ {[4x_2-3x_3+x_4 x_2 x_3 x_4] such that x_2,x_3,x_4 in ℝ} $ so a natural basis is this $ sequence{[4 1 0 0], [-3 0 1 0], [1 0 0 1] } $ (checking linear independence is easy). Thus the dimension is three.  Find a basis for, and the dimension of, each space.   $ {[x y z w] in ℝ^4 such that x-w+z=0} $ the set of $N by M$ matrices whose only nonzero entries are on the diagonal (e.g., in entry $1,1$ and $2,2$, etc.)  ${a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 such that $a_0+a_1=0$ and $a_2-2a_3=0$}⊆polyspace(_3)$     Parametrize to get this description of the space. $ {[w-z y z w] =[0 1 0 0]y+ [-1 0 1 0]z+ [1 0 0 1]w such that y,z,w in ℝ} $ That gives the space as the span of the three-vector set. To show the three vector set makes a basis we check that it is linearly independent. $ [0 0 0 0] =[0 1 0 0]c_1+ [-1 0 1 0]c_2+ [1 0 0 1]c_3 $ The second components give that $c_1=0$, and the third and fourth components give that $c_2=0$ and~$c_3=0$. So one basis is this. $ sequence{ [0 1 0 0], [-1 0 1 0], [1 0 0 1] } $ The dimension is the number of vectors in a basis: $3$.  The natural parametrization is this. $ { ([ a 0 0 0 0 0 b 0 0 0 0 0 c 0 0 0 0 0 d 0 0 0 0 0 e ]) such that a,...,e in ℝ} { ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])· a +([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])· b +·s such that a,...,e in ℝ} $ Checking that the five-element set is linearly independent is trivial. So this is a basis; the dimension is $5$. $ sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]), ..., ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]) } $  The restrictions form a two-equations, four-unknowns linear system. Parametrizing that system to express the leading variables in terms of those that are free gives $a_0=-a_1$, $a_1=a_1$, $a_2=2a_3$, and~$a_3=a_3$. $ {-a_1+a_1x+2a_3x^2+a_3x^3 such that a_1,a_3 in ℝ} ={(-1+x)· a_1+(2x^2+x^3)· a_3 such that a_1,a_3 in ℝ} $ That description shows that the space is the span of the two-element set ${-1+x,x^2+x^3}$. We will be done if we show the set is linearly independent. This relationship $ 0+0x+0x^2+0x^3=(-1+x)· c_1+(2x^2+x^3)· c_2 $ gives that $c_1=0$ from the constant terms, and $c_2=0$ from the cubic terms. One basis for the space is $-1+x,2x^2+x^3$. This is a two-dimensional space.     Find a basis for, and the dimension of, $ matspace(_){N by N} $, the vector space of $ N by N $ matrices.  For this space $ {([ a b c d ]) such that a,b,c,d in ℝ} ={a·([ 1 0 0 0 ]) +...+ d·([ 0 0 0 1 ]) such that a,b,c,d in ℝ} $ this is a natural basis. $ sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 1 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 1 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } $ The dimension is four.   Find the dimension of the vector space of matrices $ ([ a b c d ]) $ subject to each condition.  $a, b, c, d in ℝ$ $a-b+2c=0$ and~$d in ℝ$ $a+b+c=0$, $a+b-c=0$, and~$d in ℝ$    As in the prior exercise, the space $matspace(_){N by N}$ of matrices without restriction has this basis $ sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 1 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 1 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } $ and so the dimension is four. For this space $ {([ a b c d ]) such that $a=b-2c$ and $d in ℝ$} ={b·([ 1 1 0 0 ]) +c·([ -2 0 1 0 ]) +d·([ 0 0 0 1 ]) such that b,c,d in ℝ} $ this is a natural basis. $ sequence{ ([ 1 1 0 0 ]), ([ -2 0 1 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } $ The dimension is three. Gauss's Method applied to the two-equation linear system gives that $c=0$ and that $a=-b$. Thus, we have this description $ {([ -b b 0 d ]) such that b,d in ℝ} ={b·([ -1 1 0 0 ]) +d·([ 0 0 0 1 ]) such that b,d in ℝ} $ and so this is a natural basis. $ sequence{ ([ -1 1 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } $ The dimension is two.    Find the dimension of this subspace of $ ℝ^2$. $ S={[a+b a+c] such that a,b,c in ℝ} $  We cannot simply count the parameters. That is, the answer is not~$3$. Instead, observe that we can express every member $(x choose y) in ℝ^2$ in the form $ [x y]=[a+b a+c] $ with the choice of $a=0$, $b=x$, and $c=y$ (other choices are possible). So $S$ is the set $S= ℝ^2$. It has dimension~$2$.   Find the dimension of each.  The space of cubic polynomials $p(x)$ such that $p(7)=0$ The space of cubic polynomials $p(x)$ such that $p(7)=0$ and~$p(5)=0$ The space of cubic polynomials $p(x)$ such that $p(7)=0$, $p(5)=0$, and~$p(3)=0$ The space of cubic polynomials $p(x)$ such that $p(7)=0$, $p(5)=0$, $p(3)=0$, and~$p(1)=0$   The bases for these spaces are developed in the answer set of the prior subsection.  One basis is $ -7+x,-49+x^2,-343+x^3 $. The dimension is three. One basis is $35-12x+x^2,420-109x+x^3$ so the dimension is two. A basis is ${-105+71x-15x^2+x^3}$. The dimension is one. This is the trivial subspace of $polyspace(_3)$ and so the basis is empty. The dimension is zero.    What is the dimension of the span of the set ${cos^2(θ),sin^2(θ),cos(2θ),sin(2θ)}$? This span is a subspace of the space of all real-valued functions of one real variable.  First recall that $cos(2θ)=cos^2(θ-)sin^2(θ)$, and so deletion of $cos(2θ)$ from this set leaves the span unchanged. What's left, the set ${cos^2(θ),sin^2(θ),sin(2θ)}$, is linearly independent (consider the relationship $c_1cos^2(θ+c_2)sin^2(θ+c_3)sin(2θ)=Z(θ)$ where $Z$ is the zero function, and then take $θ=0$, $θ=π/4$, and $θ=π/2$ to conclude that each $c$ is zero). It is therefore a basis for its span. That shows that the span is a dimension three vector space.   Find the dimension of $ ℂ^{47} $, the vector space of $47$-tuples of complex numbers.  Here is a basis $ sequence{(1+0i,0+0i,...,0+0i), (0+1i,0+0i,...,0+0i),(0+0i,1+0i,...,0+0i),... } $ and so the dimension is $ 2· 47=94 $.   What is the dimension of the vector space $matspace(_){N by M}$ of $ N by M $ matrices?  A basis is $ sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]), ..., ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]) } $ and thus the dimension is $ 3· 5=15 $.   Show that this is a basis for $ ℝ^4$. $ sequence{[1 0 0 0], [1 1 0 0], [1 1 1 0], [1 1 1 1] } $ (We can use the results of this subsection to simplify this job.)  In a four-dimensional space a set of four vectors is linearly independent if and only if it spans the space. The form of these vectors makes linear independence easy to show (look at the equation of fourth components, then at the equation of third components, etc.).   Refer to .  Sketch a similar subspace diagram for $polyspace(_2)$. Sketch one for $matspace(_){N by N}$.    The diagram for $polyspace(_2)$ has four levels. The top level has the only three-dimensional subspace, $polyspace(_2)$ itself. The next level contains the two-dimensional subspaces (not just the linear polynomials; any two-dimensional subspace, like those polynomials of the form $ax^2+b$). Below that are the one-dimensional subspaces. Finally, of course, is the only zero-dimensional subspace, the trivial subspace. For $matspace(_){N by N}$, the diagram has five levels, including subspaces of dimension four through zero.    Where $ S $ is a set, the functions $ f: S → ℝ $ form a vector space under the natural operations: the sum $f+g$ is the function given by $ f+g(s)=f(s)+g(s) $ and the scalar product is $ r· f (s)=r· f(s) $. What is the dimension of the space resulting for each domain?  $ S={1} $ $ S={1,2} $ $ S={1,...,n} $    One Two $ n $    (See .) Prove that this is an infinite-dimensional space: the set of all functions $ f: ℝ → ℝ $ under the natural operations.  We need only produce an infinite linearly independent set. One is such sequence is $ f_1,f_2,... $ where $ f_i: ℝ → ℝ $ is $ f_i(x)=begin(cases) 1 if $ x=i $ 0 otherwise end(cases) $ the function that has value $1$ only at $x=i$.   (See .) What is the dimension of the vector space of functions $f: S → ℝ$, under the natural operations, where the domain $S$ is the empty set?  A function is a set of ordered pairs $(x,f(x))$. So there is only one function with an empty domain, namely the empty set. A vector space with only one element a trivial vector space and has dimension zero.   Show that any set of four vectors in $ ℝ^2 $ is linearly dependent.  Apply .   Show that $ sequence{vec(α)_1,vec(α)_2,vec(α)_3}⊆ ℝ^3 $ is a basis if and only if there is no plane through the origin containing all three vectors.  A plane has the form ${vec{{p}+t_1vec{{v}_1+t_2vec{{v}_2 such that t_1,t_2 in ℝ}$. (The first chapter also calls this a `$2$-flat', and contains a discussion of why this is equivalent to the description often taken in Calculus as the set of points $(x,y,z)$ subject to a condition of the form $ax+by+cz=d$). When the plane passes through the origin we can take the particular vector $vec(p)$ to be $0$. Thus, in the language we have developed in this chapter, a plane through the origin is the span of a set of two vectors.  Now for the statement. Asserting that the three are not coplanar is the same as asserting that no vector lies in the span of the other two- no vector is a linear combination of the other two. That's simply an assertion that the three-element set is linearly independent. By , that's equivalent to an assertion that the set is a basis for $ ℝ^3$ (more precisely, any sequence made from the set's elements is a basis).      Prove that any subspace of a finite dimensional space is finite dimensional.   Let the space $V$ be finite dimensional and let $S$ be a subspace of $V$.  If $S$ is not finite dimensional then it has a linearly independent set that is infinite (start with the empty set and iterate adding vectors that are not linearly dependent on the set; this process can continue for infinitely many steps or else $S$ would be finite dimensional). But any linearly independent subset of~$S$ is a linearly independent subset of~$V$, contradicting             Where is the finiteness of $ B $ used in ?  It ensures that we exhaust the $ vec(β) $'s. That is, it justifies the first sentence of the last paragraph.   Prove that if $ U $ and $ W $ are both three-dimensional subspaces of $ ℝ^5 $ then $ U intersection W $ is non-trivial. Generalize.  Let $ B_U $ be a basis for $ U $ and let $ B_W $ be a basis for $ W $. Consider the concatenation of the two basis sequences. If there is a repeated element then the intersection $ U intersection W $ is nontrivial. Otherwise, the set $ B_U∪ B_W $ is linearly dependent as it is a six member subset of the five-dimensional space $ ℝ^5 $. In either case some member of $ B_W $ is in the span of $ B_U $, and thus $ U intersection W $ is more than just the trivial space $ {0} $.  Generalization: if $ U,W $ are subspaces of a vector space of dimension $ n $ and if $ dim(U)+dim(W)>n $ then they have a nontrivial intersection.   A basis for a space consists of elements of that space. So we are naturally led to how the property `is a basis' interacts with operations $⊆$ and $∩$ and $∪$. (Of course, a basis is actually a sequence in that it is ordered, but there is a natural extension of these operations.)  Consider first how bases might be related by $⊆$. Assume that $ U,W $ are subspaces of some vector space and that $ U⊆ W $. Can there exist bases $ B_U $ for $ U $ and $ B_W $ for $ W $ such that $ B_U⊆ B_W $? Must such bases exist?  For any basis $ B_U $ for $ U $, must there be a basis $ B_W $ for $ W $ such that $ B_U⊆ B_W $?  For any basis $ B_W $ for $ W $, must there be a basis $ B_U $ for $ U $ such that $ B_U⊆ B_W $?  For any bases $ B_U, B_W $ for $ U $ and $ W $, must $ B_U $ be a subset of $ B_W $? Is the $∩$ of bases a basis? For what space? Is the $∪$ of bases a basis? For what space? What about the complement operation?  (Hint. Test any conjectures against some subspaces of $ ℝ^3 $.)  First, note that a set is a basis for some space if and only if it is linearly independent, because in that case it is a basis for its own span.  The answer to the question in the second paragraph is ``yes'' (implying ``yes'' answers for both questions in the first paragraph). If $ B_U $ is a basis for $ U $ then $ B_U $ is a linearly independent subset of $ W $. Apply to expand it to a basis for $ W $. That is the desired $ B_W $.  The answer to the question in the third paragraph is ``no'', which implies a ``no'' answer to the question of the fourth paragraph. Here is an example of a basis for a superspace with no sub-basis forming a basis for a subspace: in $ W= ℝ^2 $, consider the standard basis $ stdbasis(_2) $. No sub-basis of $stdbasis(_2)$ forms a basis for the subspace $ U $ of $ ℝ^2$ that is the line $ y=x $. It is a basis (for its span) because the intersection of linearly independent sets is linearly independent (the intersection is a subset of each of the linearly independent sets).  It is not, however, a basis for the intersection of the spaces. For instance, these are bases for $ ℝ^2 $: $ B_1=[1 0],[0 1] and B_2=[2 0],[0 2] $ and $ ℝ^2 intersection ℝ^2= ℝ^2 $, but $ B_1 intersection B_2 $ is empty. All we can say is that the $∩$ of the bases is a basis for a subset of the intersection of the spaces. The $∪$ of bases need not be a basis: in $ ℝ^2 $ $ B_1=[1 0],[1 1] and B_2=[1 0],[0 2] $ $ B_1∪ B_2 $ is not linearly independent. A necessary and sufficient condition for a $∪$ of two bases to be a basis $ B_1∪ B_2 is linearly independent ⇔ span(B_1 intersection B_2)=span(B_1) intersection span(B_2) $ it is easy enough to prove (but perhaps hard to apply). The complement of a basis cannot be a basis because it contains the zero vector.    Consider how `dimension' interacts with `subset'. Assume $ U $ and $ W $ are both subspaces of some vector space, and that $ U⊆ W $.  Prove that $ dim (U)≤dim (W) $. Prove that equality of dimension holds if and only if $ U=W $. Show that the prior item does not hold if they are infinite-dimensional.    A basis for $ U $ is a linearly independent set in $ W $ and so can be expanded via to a basis for $ W $. The second basis has at least as many members as the first. One direction is clear:~if $ V=W $ then they have the same dimension. For the converse, let $ B_U $ be a basis for $ U $. It is a linearly independent subset of $ W $ and so can be expanded to a basis for $ W $. If $ dim(U)=dim(W) $ then this basis for $ W $ has no more members than does $ B_U $ and so equals $ B_U $. Since $ U $ and $ W $ have the same bases, they are equal. Let $ W $ be the space of finite-degree polynomials and let $ U $ be the subspace of polynomials that have only even-powered terms. $ {a_0+a_1x^2+a_2x^4+...+a_nx^{{2n} such that a_0,...,a_n in ℝ} $ Both spaces have infinite dimension, but $ U $ is a proper subspace.     For any vector $vec(v)$ in $ ℝ^n$ and any permutation $σ$ of the numbers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$ (that is, $σ$ is a rearrangement of those numbers into a new order), define $σ(vec(v))$ to be the vector whose components are $v_{σ(1)}$, $v_{σ(2)}$, ..., and $v_{σ(n)}$ (where $σ(1)$ is the first number in the rearrangement, etc.). Now fix $vec(v)$ and let $V$ be the span of ${σ(vec{{v}) such that {$σ$ permutes $1$, ..., $n$}$. What are the possibilities for the dimension of $V$?  The possibilities for the dimension of $V$ are $0$, $1$, $n-1$, and $n$.  To see this, first consider the case when all the coordinates of $vec(v)$ are equal. $ vec(v)=[z z ... z] $ Then $σ(vec(v))=vec(v)$ for every permutation $σ$, so $V$ is just the span of $vec(v)$, which has dimension $0$ or $1$ according to whether $vec(v)$ is $0$ or not.  Now suppose not all the coordinates of $vec(v)$ are equal; let $x$ and $y$ with $x ≠ y$ be among the coordinates of $vec(v)$. Then we can find permutations $σ_1$ and $σ_2$ such that $ σ_1(vec(v))=[x y a_3 ... a_n] and σ_2(vec(v))=[y x a_3 ... a_n] $ for some $a_3,...,a_n in ℝ$. Therefore, $ (1/y-x)[(σ_1(vec(v))-σ_2(vec(v))])= [-1 1 0 ... 0] $ is in $V$. That is, $vec(e)_2-vec(e)_1 in V$, where $vec(e)_1$, $vec(e)_2$, ..., $vec(e)_n$ is the standard basis for $ ℝ^n$. Similarly, $vec(e)_3-vec(e)_2$, ..., $vec(e)_n-vec(e)_1$ are all in $V$. It is easy to see that the vectors $vec(e)_2-vec(e)_1$, $vec(e)_3-vec(e)_2$, ..., $vec(e)_n-vec(e)_1$ are linearly independent (that is, form a linearly independent set), so $dim V≥ n-1$.  Finally, we can write $ vec(v) =x_1vec(e)_1+x_2vec(e)_2+...+x_nvec(e)_n =(x_1+x_2+...+x_n)vec(e)_1+x_2(vec(e)_2-vec(e)_1)+... +x_n(vec(e)_n-vec(e)_1) $ This shows that if $x_1+x_2+...+x_n=0$ then $vec(v)$ is in the span of $vec(e)_2-vec(e)_1$, ..., $vec(e_n)-vec(e)_1$ (that is, is in the span of the set of those vectors); similarly, each $σ(vec(v))$ will be in this span, so $V$ will equal this span and $dim V=n-1$. On the other hand, if $x_1+x_2+·s+x_n ≠ 0$ then the above equation shows that $vec(e)_1 in V$ and thus $vec(e)_1,...,vec(e)_n in V$, so $V= ℝ^n$ and $dim V=n$.                                We will now reconsider linear systems and Gauss's Method, aided by the tools and terms of this chapter. We will make three points.  For the first, recall the insight from the Chapter One that Gauss's Method works by taking linear combinations of rows- if two matrices are related by row operations $A-->·s--> B$ then each row of $B$ is a linear combination of the rows of $A$. Therefore, the right setting in which to study row operations in general, and Gauss's Method in particular, is the following vector space.    The row space of a matrix is the span of the set of its rows. The row rank is the dimension of this space, the number of linearly independent rows.    For example If $ A=([ 2 3 4 6 ]) $ then $ rowspace A $ is this subspace of the space of two-component row vectors. $ {c_1·[2 3]+c_2·[4 6] such that c_1,c_2 in ℝ } $ The second row vector is linearly dependent on the first and so we can simplify the above description to ${c·[2 3] such that c in ℝ }$.     If two matrices $ A $ and $ B $ are related by a row operation $ Afor step $ρ_i↔ρ_j$B or Afor step $kρ_i$B or Afor step $kρ_i+ρ_j$B $ (for $i ≠ j$ and $k ≠ 0$) then their row spaces are equal. Hence, row-equivalent matrices have the same row space and therefore the same row rank.      Corollary One.III. shows that when $A--> B$ then each row of $B$ is a linear combination of the rows of $ A $. That is, in the above terminology, each row of $ B $ is an element of the row space of $A$. Then $rowspace B⊆rowspace A$ follows because a member of the set $rowspace B$ is a linear combination of the rows of $B$, so it is a combination of combinations of the rows of $A$, and by the Linear Combination Lemma is also a member of $rowspace A$.    For the other set containment, recall Lemma One.III., that row operations are reversible so $A--> B$ if and only if $B--> A$. Then $rowspace A⊆rowspace B$ follows as in the previous paragraph.     Of course, Gauss's Method performs the row operations systematically, with the goal of echelon form.    The nonzero rows of an echelon form matrix make up a linearly independent set.      Lemma~One.III. says that no nonzero row of an echelon form matrix is a linear combination of the other rows. This result just restates that in this chapter's terminology.    Thus, in the language of this chapter, Gaussian reduction works by eliminating linear dependences among rows, leaving the span unchanged, until no nontrivial linear relationships remain among the nonzero rows. In short, Gauss's Method produces a basis for the row space.  For example From any matrix, we can produce a basis for the row space by performing Gauss's Method and taking the nonzero rows of the resulting echelon form matrix. For instance, $ ([ 1 3 1 1 4 1 2 0 5 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $6ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 3 1 0 1 0 0 0 3 ]) $ produces the basis $sequence{[1 3 1], [0 1 0], [0 0 3] }$ for the row space. This is a basis for the row space of both the starting and ending matrices, since the two row spaces are equal.   Using this technique, we can also find bases for spans not directly involving row vectors.    The column space of a matrix is the span of the set of its columns. The column rank is the dimension of the column space, the number of linearly independent columns.    Our interest in column spaces stems from our study of linear systems. An example is that this system $ $ c_1 + 3c_2 + 7c_3 = d_1 2c_1 + 3c_2 + 8c_3 = d_2 c_2 + 2c_3 = d_3 4c_1 + 4c_3 = d_4 $ $ has a solution if and only if the vector of $ d $'s is a linear combination of the other column vectors, $ c_1[1 2 0 4] +c_2[3 3 1 0] +c_3[7 8 2 4] =[d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4] $ meaning that the vector of $ d $'s is in the column space of the matrix of coefficients.  For example Given this matrix, $ ([ 1 3 7 2 3 8 0 1 2 4 0 4 ]) $ to get a basis for the column space, temporarily turn the columns into rows and reduce. $ ([ 1 2 0 4 3 3 1 0 7 8 2 4 ]) for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 0 4 0 -3 1 -12 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Now turn the rows back to columns. $ sequence{ [1 2 0 4], [0 -3 1 -12] } $ The result is a basis for the column space of the given matrix.     The transpose of a matrix is the result of interchanging its rows and columns, so that column~$ j $ of the matrix $ A $ is row~$ j $ of $ Aᵀ $ and vice versa.   So we can summarize the prior example as ``transpose, reduce, and transpose back.''  We can even, at the price of tolerating the as-yet-vague idea of vector spaces being ``the same,'' use Gauss's Method to find bases for spans in other types of vector spaces.  For example To get a basis for the span of $ {x^2+x^4,2x^2+3x^4,-x^2-3x^4} $ in the space $ polyspace(_4) $, think of these three polynomials as ``the same'' as the row vectors $ [0 0 1 0 1] $, $ [0 0 2 0 3] $, and $ [0 0 -1 0 -3] $, apply Gauss's Method $ ([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 -1 0 -3 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ and translate back to get the basis $ x^2+x^4,x^4 $. (As mentioned earlier, we will make the phrase ``the same'' precise at the start of the next chapter.)   Thus, the first point for this subsection is that the tools of this chapter give us a more conceptual understanding of Gaussian reduction.  For the second point observe that row operations on a matrix can change its column space. $ ([ 1 2 2 4 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 0 0 ]) $ The column space of the left-hand matrix contains vectors with a second component that is nonzero but the column space of the right-hand matrix contains only vectors whose second component is zero, so the two spaces are different. This observation makes next result surprising.    Row operations do not change the column rank.      Restated, if $A$ reduces to $B$ then the column rank of $B$ equals the column rank of $A$.  This proof will be finished if we show that row operations do not affect linear relationships among columns, because the column rank is the size of the largest set of unrelated columns. That is, we will show that a relationship exists among columns (such as that the fifth column is twice the second plus the fourth) if and only if that relationship exists after the row operation. But this is exactly the first theorem of this book, Theorem One.I.:~in a relationship among columns, $ c_1·[a_{1,1] a_{2,1} ... a_{m,1}} +...+ c_n· [a_{1,n] a_{2,n} ... a_{m,n}} =[0 0 ... 0] $ row operations leave unchanged the set of solutions $ (c_1,...,c_n) $.    Another way to make the point that Gauss's Method has something to say about the column space as well as about the row space is with Gauss-Jordan reduction. It ends with the reduced echelon form of a matrix, as here. $ ([ 1 3 1 6 2 6 3 16 1 3 1 6 ]) for step $$·sfor step $$ ([ 1 3 0 2 0 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Consider the row space and the column space of this result.  The first point made earlier in this subsection says that to get a basis for the row space we can just collect the rows with leading entries. However, because this is in reduced echelon form, a basis for the column space is just as easy:~collect the columns containing the leading entries, $ sequence{vec(e)_1,vec(e)_2} $.    Thus, for a reduced echelon form matrix we can find bases for the row and column spaces in essentially the same way, by taking the parts of the matrix, the rows or columns, containing the leading entries.    For any matrix, the row rank and column rank are equal.      Bring the matrix to reduced echelon form. Then the row rank equals the number of leading entries since that equals the number of nonzero rows. Then also, the number of leading entries equals the column rank because the set of columns containing leading entries consists of some of the $ vec(e)_i $'s from a standard basis, and that set is linearly independent and spans the set of columns. Hence, in the reduced echelon form matrix, the row rank equals the column rank, because each equals the number of leading entries.    But and show that the row rank and column rank are not changed by using row operations to get to reduced echelon form. Thus the row rank and the column rank of the original matrix are also equal.      The rank of a matrix is its row rank or column rank.    So the second point that we have made in this subsection is that the column space and row space of a matrix have the same dimension.  Our final point is that the concepts that we've seen arising naturally in the study of vector spaces are exactly the ones that we have studied with linear systems.    For linear systems with $ n $ unknowns and with matrix of coefficients $ A $, the statements  the rank of $ A $ is $ r $ the vector space of solutions of the associated homogeneous system has dimension $ n-r $  are equivalent.    parSo(if) the system has at least one particular solution then for the set of solutions, the number of parameters equals $n-r$, the number of variables minus the rank of the matrix of coefficients.    The rank of $ A $ is $ r $ if and only if Gaussian reduction on $ A $ ends with $ r $ nonzero rows. That's true if and only if echelon form matrices row equivalent to $ A $ have $ r $-many leading variables. That in turn holds if and only if there are $ n-r $ free variables.      Where the matrix $A$ is $ N by N $, these statements  the rank of $ A $ is $ n $ $ A $ is nonsingular the rows of $ A $ form a linearly independent set the columns of $ A $ form a linearly independent set any linear system whose matrix of coefficients is $ A $ has one and only one solution  are equivalent.      Clearly $ (1)⇔(2)⇔(3)⇔(4) $. The last, $ (4)⇔(5) $, holds because a set of $ n $ column vectors is linearly independent if and only if it is a basis for $ ℝ^n $, but the system $ c_1[a_{1,1] a_{2,1} ... a_{m,1}} +...+ c_n[a_{1,n] a_{2,n} ... a_{m,n}} =[d_1 d_2 ... d_m] $ has a unique solution for all choices of $ d_1,...,d_n in ℝ $ if and only if the vectors of $ a $'s on the left form a basis.     Sometimes the results of this subsection are mistakenly remembered to say that the general solution of an $ n $~unknowns system of $ m $~equations uses $ n-m $ parameters. The number of equations is not the relevant figure, rather, what matters is the number of independent equations, the number of equations in a maximal independent set. Where there are $ r $ independent equations, the general solution involves $ n-r $ parameters.      Transpose each.  $ ([ 2 1 3 1 ]) $ $ ([ 2 1 1 3 ]) $ $ ([ 1 4 3 6 7 8 ]) $ $ [0 0 0] $ $ [-1 -2] $    $ ([ 2 3 1 1 ]) $ $ ([ 2 1 1 3 ]) $ $ ([ 1 6 4 7 3 8 ]) $ $ [0 0 0] $ $ [-1 -2] $    Decide if the vector is in the row space of the matrix.  $ ([ 2 1 3 1 ]) $, $ [1 0] $ $ ([ 0 1 3 -1 0 1 -1 2 7 ]) $, $ [1 1 1] $    Yes. To see if there are $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $ c_1·[2 1]+c_2·[3 1]=[1 0] $ we solve $ $ 2c_1 + 3c_2 = 1 c_1 + c_2 = 0 $ $ and get $ c_1=-1 $ and $ c_2=1 $. Thus the vector is in the row space. No. The equation $ c_1[0 1 3] +c_2[-1 0 1] +c_3[-1 2 7] =[1 1 1] $ has no solution. $ ([ 0 -1 -1 1 1 0 2 1 3 1 7 1 ]) for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 2 1 0 -1 -1 1 0 0 0 -1 ]) $ Thus, the vector is not in the row space.    Decide if the vector is in the column space.  $ ([ 1 1 1 1 ]) $, $ [1 3] $ $ ([ 1 3 1 2 0 4 1 -3 -3 ]) $, $ [1 0 0] $    No. To see if there are $ c_1,c_2 in ℝ $ such that $ c_1[1 1] +c_2[1 1] =[1 3] $ we can use Gauss's Method on the resulting linear system. $ $ c_1 + c_2 = 1 c_1 + c_2 = 3 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ c_1 + c_2 = 1 0 = 2 $ $ There is no solution and so the vector is not in the column space. Yes. From this relationship $ c_1[1 2 1] +c_2[3 0 -3] +c_3[1 4 3] =[1 0 0] $ we get a linear system that, when we apply Gauss's Method, $ ([ 1 3 1 1 2 0 4 0 1 -3 -3 0 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 3 1 1 0 -6 2 -2 0 0 -6 1 ]) $ yields a solution. Thus, the vector is in the column space.    Decide if the vector is in the column space of the matrix.  $ ([ 2 1 2 5 ]) $,~$ [1 -3] $ $ ([ 4 -8 2 -4 ]) $,~$ [0 1] $ $ ([ 1 -1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 1 ]) $,~$ [2 0 0] $    Yes; we are asking if there are scalars $ c_1 $ and $ c_2 $ such that $ c_1[2 2]+c_2[1 5]=[1 -3] $ which gives rise to a linear system $ $ 2c_1 + c_2 = 1 2c_1 + 5c_2 = -3 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 2c_1 + c_2 = 1 4c_2 = -4 $ $ and Gauss's Method produces $ c_2=-1 $ and $ c_1=1 $. That is, there is indeed such a pair of scalars and so the vector is indeed in the column space of the matrix. No; we are asking if there are scalars $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $ c_1[4 2]+c_2[-8 -4]=[0 1] $ and one way to proceed is to consider the resulting linear system $ $ 4c_1 - 8c_2 = 0 2c_1 - 4c_2 = 1 $ $ that is easily seen to have no solution. Another way to proceed is to note that any linear combination of the columns on the left has a second component half as big as its first component, but the vector on the right does not meet that criterion. Yes; we can simply observe that the vector is the first column minus the second. Or, failing that, setting up the relationship among the columns $ c_1[1 1 -1] +c_2[-1 1 -1] +c_3[1 -1 1] =[2 0 0] $ and considering the resulting linear system $ $ c_1 - c_2 + c_3 = 2 c_1 + c_2 - c_3 = 0 -c_1 - c_2 + c_3 = 0 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ c_1 - c_2 + c_3 = 2 2c_2 - 2c_3 = -2 -2c_2 + 2c_3 = 2 $ for step $ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ c_1 - c_2 + c_3 = 2 2c_2 - 2c_3 = -2 0 = 0 $ $ gives the additional information (beyond that there is at least one solution) that there are infinitely many solutions. Parametrizing gives $c_2=-1+c_3$ and $c_1=1$, and so taking $c_3$ to be zero gives a particular solution of $c_1=1$, $c_2=-1$, and $c_3=0$ (which is, of course, the observation made at the start).    Find a basis for the row space of this matrix. $ ([ 2 0 3 4 0 1 1 -1 3 1 0 2 1 0 -4 -1 ]) $        A routine Gaussian reduction $ ([ 2 0 3 4 0 1 1 -1 3 1 0 2 1 0 -4 -1 ]) for step $-(3/2)ρ_1+ρ_3$ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ repeat step $-ρ_3+ρ_4$ ([ 2 0 3 4 0 1 1 -1 0 0 -11/2 -3 0 0 0 0 ]) $ suggests this basis $sequence{[2 0 3 4], [0 1 1 -1],[0 0 -11/2 -3]}$.  Another procedure, perhaps more convenient, is to swap rows first,        $ for step $ρ_1 ↔ ρ_4$ repeat step $-3ρ_1+ρ_3$ repeat step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ repeat step $-ρ_3+ρ_4$ ([ 1 0 -4 -1 0 1 1 -1 0 0 11 6 0 0 0 0 ]) $ leading to the basis $ sequence{[1 0 -4 -1],[0 1 1 -1], [0 0 11 6]} $.   Find the rank of each matrix.  $ ([ 2 1 3 1 -1 2 1 0 3 ]) $ $ ([ 1 -1 2 3 -3 6 -2 2 -4 ]) $ $ ([ 1 3 2 5 1 1 6 4 3 ]) $ $ ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $    This reduction $  for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-(1/3)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 2 1 3 0 -3/2 1/2 0 0 4/3 ]) $ shows that the row rank, and hence the rank, is three. Inspection of the columns shows that the others are multiples of the first (inspection of the rows shows the same thing). Thus the rank is one.  Alternatively, the reduction $ ([ 1 -1 2 3 -3 6 -2 2 -4 ]) for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 -1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ shows the same thing. This calculation $ ([ 1 3 2 5 1 1 6 4 3 ]) for step $-5ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 3 2 0 -14 -9 0 0 0 ]) $ shows that the rank is two. The rank is zero.   Give a basis for the column space of this matrix. Give the matrix's rank. $ ([ 1 3 -1 2 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 4 ]) $  We want a basis for this span. $ spanof{[1 2 0], [3 1 1], [-1 1 1], [2 0 4]}⊆ ℝ^3 $ The most straightforward approach is to transpose those columns to rows, use Gauss's Method to find a basis for the span of the rows, and then transpose them back to columns. $ ([ 1 2 0 3 1 1 -1 1 1 2 0 4 ]) for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ for step $(3/5)ρ_2+ρ_3$ for step $-2ρ_3+ρ_4$ ([ 1 2 0 0 -5 1 0 0 8/5 0 0 0 ]) $ Discard the zero vector as showing that there was a redundancy among the starting vectors, to get this basis for the column space. $ sequence{ [1 2 0], [0 -5 1], [0 0 8/5] } $ The matrix's rank is the dimension of its column space, so it is three. (It is also equal to the dimension of its row space.)   Find a basis for the span of each set.  $ {[1 3], [-1 3], [1 4], [2 1] }⊆matspace(_){N by M} $ $ {[1 2 1], [3 1 -1], [1 -3 -3] }⊆ ℝ^3 $ $ {1+x,1-x^2,3+2x-x^2}⊆polyspace(_3) $ $ { ([ 1 0 1 3 1 -1 ]), ([ 1 0 3 2 1 4 ]), ([ -1 0 -5 -1 -1 -9 ]) } ⊆matspace(_){N by M} $    This reduction $ ([ 1 3 -1 3 1 4 2 1 ]) for step $ρ_1+ρ_2$ for step $-(1/6)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 3 0 6 0 0 0 0 ]) $ gives $ [1 3],[0 6] $. Transposing and reducing $ ([ 1 2 1 3 1 -1 1 -3 -3 ]) for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 1 0 -5 -4 0 -5 -4 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 1 0 -5 -4 0 0 0 ]) $ and then transposing back gives this basis. $ sequence{[1 2 1], [0 -5 -4] } $ Notice first that the surrounding space is as $polyspace(_3)$, not $polyspace(_2)$. Then, taking the first polynomial $1+1· x+0· x^2+0· x^3$ to be ``the same'' as the row vector $[1 1 0 0]$, etc., leads to $ ([ 1 1 0 0 1 0 -1 0 3 2 -1 0 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 0 0 0 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ which yields the basis $ 1+x,-x-x^2 $. Here ``the same'' gives $ ([ 1 0 1 3 1 -1 1 0 3 2 1 4 -1 0 -5 -1 -1 -9 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 1 3 1 -1 0 0 2 -1 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ leading to this basis. $ sequence{ ([ 1 0 1 3 1 -1 ]), ([ 0 0 2 -1 0 5 ]) } $   Give a basis for the span of each set, in the natural vector space.   ${[1 1 3], [-1 2 0], [0 12 6]}$ ${x+x^2, 2-2x, 7, 4+3x+2x^2}$     Transpose the columns to rows, bring to echelon form (and then lose any zero rows), and transpose back to columns. $ ([ 1 1 3 -1 2 0 0 12 6 ]) for step $ρ_1+ρ_2$ for step $-4ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 3 0 3 3 0 0 -6 ]) $ One basis for the span is this. $ sequence{ [1 1 3], [0 3 3], [0 0 -6] } $  As in the prior part we think of those as rows, to take advantage of the work we've done with Gauss's Method. $ ([ 0 1 1 2 -2 0 7 0 0 4 3 2 ]) for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ for step $-(7/2)ρ_1+ρ_3$ for step $-7ρ_2+ρ_3$ for step $-(5/7)ρ_3+ρ_4$ ([ 2 -2 0 0 1 1 0 0 -7 0 0 0 ]) $ One basis for the span of that set is $2-2x, x+x^2, -5x^2$.    Which matrices have rank zero? Rank one?  Only the zero matrices have rank of zero. The only matrices of rank one have the form $ ([ k_1· ρ ... k_m· ρ ]) $ where $ ρ $ is some nonzero row vector, and not all of the $ k_i $'s are zero. (Remark. We can't simply say that all of the rows are multiples of the first because the first row might be the zero row. Another Remark. The above also applies with `column' replacing `row'.)   Given $ a,b,c in ℝ $, what choice of $ d $ will cause this matrix to have the rank of one? $ ([ a b c d ]) $  If $ a ≠ 0 $ then a choice of $ d=(c/a)b $ will make the second row be a multiple of the first, specifically, $ c/a $ times the first. If $ a=0 $ and $ b=0 $ then any non-$ 0 $ choice for $ d $ will ensure that the second row is nonzero. If $ a=0 $ and $ b ≠ 0 $ and $ c=0 $ then any choice for $ d $ will do, since the matrix will automatically have rank one (even with the choice of $d=0$). Finally, if $ a=0 $ and $ b ≠ 0 $ and $ c ≠ 0 $ then no choice for $ d $ will suffice because the matrix is sure to have rank two.   Find the column rank of this matrix. $ ([ 1 3 -1 5 0 4 2 0 1 0 4 1 ]) $  The column rank is two. One way to see this is by inspection- the column space consists of two-tall columns and so can have a dimension of at least two, and we can easily find two columns that together form a linearly independent set (the fourth and fifth columns, for instance). Another way to see this is to recall that the column rank equals the row rank, and to perform Gauss's Method, which leaves two nonzero rows.   Show that a linear system with at least one solution has at most one solution if and only if the matrix of coefficients has rank equal to the number of its columns.  We apply . The number of columns of a matrix of coefficients $A$ of a linear system equals the number $n$ of unknowns. A linear system with at least one solution has at most one solution if and only if the space of solutions of the associated homogeneous system has dimension zero (recall:~in the `$General=Particular+Homogeneous$' equation $vec(v)=vec(p)+vec(h)$, provided that such a $vec(p)$ exists, the solution $vec(v)$ is unique if and only if the vector $vec(h)$ is unique, namely $vec(h)=0$). But that means, by the theorem, that $n=r$.   If a matrix is $ N by M $, which set must be dependent, its set of rows or its set of columns?  The set of columns must be dependent because the rank of the matrix is at most five while there are nine columns.   Give an example to show that, despite that they have the same dimension, the row space and column space of a matrix need not be equal. Are they ever equal?  There is little danger of their being equal since the row space is a set of row vectors while the column space is a set of columns (unless the matrix is $ N by N $, in which case the two spaces must be equal).  Remark. Consider $ A=([ 1 3 2 6 ]) $ and note that the row space is the set of all multiples of $ [1 3] $ while the column space consists of multiples of $ [1 2] $ so we also cannot argue that the two spaces must be simply transposes of each other.   Show that the set $ {(1,-1,2,-3),(1,1,2,0),(3,-1,6,-6)} $ does not have the same span as $ {(1,0,1,0),(0,2,0,3)} $. What, by the way, is the vector space?  First, the vector space is the set of four-tuples of real numbers, under the natural operations. Although this is not the set of four-wide row vectors, the difference is slight- it is ``the same'' as that set. So we will treat the four-tuples like four-wide vectors.  With that, one way to see that $ (1,0,1,0) $ is not in the span of the first set is to note that this reduction $ ([ 1 -1 2 -3 1 1 2 0 3 -1 6 -6 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 -1 2 -3 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 ]) $ and this one $ ([ 1 -1 2 -3 1 1 2 0 3 -1 6 -6 1 0 1 0 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ repeat step $ρ_3↔ρ_4$ ([ 1 -1 2 -3 0 2 0 3 0 0 -1 3/2 0 0 0 0 ]) $ yield matrices differing in rank. This means that addition of $(1,0,1,0)$ to the set of the first three four-tuples increases the rank, and hence the span, of that set. Therefore $(1,0,1,0)$ is not already in the span.   Show that this set of column vectors $ {[d_1 d_2 d_3] such that there are $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that: $ 3x + 2y + 4z = d_1 x - z = d_2 2x + 2y + 5z = d_3 $ } $ is a subspace of $ ℝ^3 $. Find a basis.  It is a subspace because it is the column space of the matrix $ ([ 3 2 4 1 0 -1 2 2 5 ]) $ of coefficients. To find a basis for the column space, $ {c_1[3 1 2] +c_2[2 0 2] +c_3[4 -1 5] such that c_1,c_2,c_3 in ℝ} $ we eliminate linear relationships among the three column vectors from the spanning set by transposing, reducing, $ ([ 3 1 2 2 0 2 4 -1 5 ]) for step $-(2/3)ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $-(7/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 3 1 2 0 -2/3 2/3 0 0 0 ]) $ omitting the zero row, and transposing back. $ sequence{ [3 1 2], [0 -2/3 2/3] } $   Show that the transpose operation is linear: $ (rA+sB)ᵀ = rAᵀ+sBᵀ $ for $ r,s in ℝ $ and $ A,B inmatspace(_){N by M} $.  We can do this as a straightforward calculation. $ (rA+sB)ᵀ =trans{([ ra_{1,1}+sb_{1,1} ... ra_{1,n}+sb_{1,n} ... ra_{m,1}+sb_{m,1} ... ra_{m,n}+sb_{m,n} ]) } =([ ra_{1,1}+sb_{1,1} ... ra_{m,1}+sb_{m,1} ... ra_{1,n}+sb_{1,n} ... ra_{m,n}+sb_{m,n} ]) =([ ra_{1,1} ... ra_{m,1} ... ra_{1,n} ... ra_{m,n} ]) +([ sb_{1,1} ... sb_{m,1} ... sb_{1,n} ... sb_{m,n} ]) =rAᵀ+sBᵀ $   In this subsection we have shown that Gaussian reduction finds a basis for the row space.  Show that this basis is not unique- different reductions may yield different bases. Produce matrices with equal row spaces but unequal numbers of rows. Prove that two matrices have equal row spaces if and only if after Gauss-Jordan reduction they have the same nonzero rows.    These reductions give different bases. $ ([ 1 2 0 1 2 1 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 0 0 0 1 ])  ([ 1 2 0 1 2 1 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $2ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 0 0 0 2 ]) $ An easy example is this. $ ([ 1 2 1 3 1 4 ])  ([ 1 2 1 3 1 4 0 0 0 ]) $ This is a less simplistic example. $ ([ 1 2 1 3 1 4 ])  ([ 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 4 2 4 3 5 ]) $ Assume that $ A $ and $ B $ are matrices with equal row spaces. Construct a matrix $ C $ with the rows of $ A $ above the rows of $ B $, and another matrix $ D $ with the rows of $ B $ above the rows of $ A $. $ C=([ A B ])  D=([ B A ]) $ Observe that $ C $ and $ D $ are row-equivalent (via a sequence of row-swaps) and so Gauss-Jordan reduce to the same reduced echelon form matrix.  Because the row spaces are equal, the rows of $ B $ are linear combinations of the rows of $ A $ so Gauss-Jordan reduction on $ C $ simply turns the rows of $ B $ to zero rows and thus the nonzero rows of $C$ are just the nonzero rows obtained by Gauss-Jordan reducing $ A $. The same can be said for the matrix $ D $- Gauss-Jordan reduction on $ D $ gives the same non-zero rows as are produced by reduction on $ B $ alone. Therefore, $ A $ yields the same nonzero rows as $ C $, which yields the same nonzero rows as $ D $, which yields the same nonzero rows as $ B $.    Why is there not a problem with in the case that $ r $ is bigger than $ n $?  It cannot be bigger.   Show that the row rank of an $ N by M $ matrix is at most $ m $. Is there a better bound?  The number of rows in a maximal linearly independent set cannot exceed the number of rows. A better bound (the bound that is, in general, the best possible) is the minimum of $ m $ and $ n $, because the row rank equals the column rank.   Show that the rank of a matrix equals the rank of its transpose.  Because the rows of a matrix $ A $ are the columns of $ Aᵀ $ the dimension of the row space of $ A $ equals the dimension of the column space of $ Aᵀ $. But the dimension of the row space of $ A $ is the rank of $ A $ and the dimension of the column space of $ Aᵀ $ is the rank of $ Aᵀ $. Thus the two ranks are equal.   True or false:~the column space of a matrix equals the row space of its transpose.  False. The first is a set of columns while the second is a set of rows.  This example, however, $ A=([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]),  Aᵀ=([ 1 4 2 5 3 6 ]) $ indicates that as soon as we have a formal meaning for ``the same'', we can apply it here: $ colspace(A)=spanof{{ [1 4], [2 5], [3 6] } } $ while $ rowspace Aᵀ=spanof{{ [1 4], [2 5], [3 6] } } $ are ``the same'' as each other.   We have seen that a row operation may change the column space. Must it?  No. Here, Gauss's Method does not change the column space. $ ([ 1 0 3 1 ]) for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $   Prove that a linear system has a solution if and only if that system's matrix of coefficients has the same rank as its augmented matrix.  A linear system $ c_1vec(a)_1+...+c_nvec(a)_n=vec(d) $ has a solution if and only if $ vec(d) $ is in the span of the set $ {vec{{a}_1,...,vec{{a}_n} $. That's true if and only if the column rank of the augmented matrix equals the column rank of the matrix of coefficients. Since rank equals the column rank, the system has a solution if and only if the rank of its augmented matrix equals the rank of its matrix of coefficients.   An $ N by M $ matrix has full row rank if its row rank is $ m $, and it has full column rank if its column rank is $ n $.  Show that a matrix can have both full row rank and full column rank only if it is square. Prove that the linear system with matrix of coefficients $ A $ has a solution for any $ d_1 $, ..., $ d_n $'s on the right side if and only if $ A $ has full row rank. Prove that a homogeneous system has a unique solution if and only if its matrix of coefficients $A$ has full column rank. Prove that the statement ``if a system with matrix of coefficients $ A $ has any solution then it has a unique solution'' holds if and only if $ A $ has full column rank.    Row rank equals column rank so each is at most the minimum of the number of rows and columns. Hence both can be full only if the number of rows equals the number of columns. (Of course, the converse does not hold:~a square matrix need not have full row rank or full column rank.) If $ A $ has full row rank then, no matter what the right-hand side, Gauss's Method on the augmented matrix ends with a leading one in each row and none of those leading ones in the furthest right column (the ``augmenting'' column). Back substitution then gives a solution.  On the other hand, if the linear system lacks a solution for some right-hand side it can only be because Gauss's Method leaves some row so that it is all zeroes to the left of the ``augmenting'' bar and has a nonzero entry on the right. Thus, if $A$ does not have a solution for some right-hand sides, then $ A $ does not have full row rank because some of its rows have been eliminated. The matrix $ A $ has full column rank if and only if its columns form a linearly independent set. That's equivalent to the existence of only the trivial linear relationship among the columns, so the only solution of the system is where each variable is $0$. The matrix $ A $ has full column rank if and only if the set of its columns is linearly independent, and so forms a basis for its span. That's equivalent to the existence of a unique linear representation of all vectors in that span. That proves it, since any linear representation of a vector in the span is a solution of the linear system.    How would the conclusion of change if Gauss's Method were changed to allow multiplying a row by zero?  Instead of the row spaces being the same, the row space of $B$ would be a subspace (possibly equal to) the row space of $A$.   What is the relationship between $ rank(A) $ and $ rank(-A) $? Between $ rank(A) $ and $ rank(kA) $? What, if any, is the relationship between $ rank(A) $, $ rank(B) $, and $ rank(A+B) $?  Clearly $ rank(A)=rank(-A) $ as Gauss's Method allows us to multiply all rows of a matrix by $ -1 $. In the same way, when $ k ≠ 0 $ we have $ rank(A)=rank(kA) $.  Addition is more interesting. The rank of a sum can be smaller than the rank of the summands. $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) + ([ -1 -2 -3 -4 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) $ The rank of a sum can be bigger than the rank of the summands. $ ([ 1 2 0 0 ]) + ([ 0 0 3 4 ]) = ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) $ But there is an upper bound (other than the size of the matrices). In general, $ rank(A+B)≤rank(A)+rank(B) $.  To prove this, note that we can perform Gaussian elimination on $ A+B $ in either of two ways: we can first add $ A $ to $ B $ and then apply the appropriate sequence of reduction steps $ (A+B) grstep(step_1) ·s grstep(step_k) echelon form $ or we can get the same results by performing $ step_1 $ through $ step_k $ separately on $ A $ and $ B $, and then adding. The largest rank that we can end with in the second case is clearly the sum of the ranks. (The matrices above give examples of both possibilities, $rank(A+B)<rank(A)+rank(B)$ and $rank(A+B)=rank(A)+rank(B)$, happening.)                             textit{This subsection is optional. It is required only for the last sections of Chapter Three and Chapter Five and for occasional exercises. You can pass it over without loss of continuity.}        One way to understand something is to see how to build it from component parts. For instance, we sometimes think of $ ℝ^3 $ put together from the $ x $-axis, the $ y $-axis, and $ z $-axis. In this subsection we will describe how to decompose a vector space into a combination of some of its subspaces. In developing this idea of subspace combination, we will keep the $ ℝ^3$ example in mind as a prototype.  Subspaces are subsets and sets combine via union. But taking the combination operation for subspaces to be the simple set union operation isn't what we want. For instance, the union of the $ x $-axis, the $ y $-axis, and $ z $-axis is not all of $ ℝ^3$. In fact this union is not a subspace because it is not closed under addition: this vector $ [1 0 0] + [0 1 0] + [0 0 1] = [1 1 1] $ is in none of the three axes and hence is not in the union. Therefore to combine subspaces, in addition to the members of those subspaces, we must at least also include all of their linear combinations.   Where $ W_1,..., W_k $ are subspaces of a vector space, their sum is the span of their union $W_1+W_2+... +W_k=span(W_1∪ W_2∪ ·s W_k)$.   Writing `$ + $' fits with the conventional practice of using this symbol for a natural accumulation operation.  For example Our $ ℝ^3$ prototype works with this. Any vector $vec(w) in ℝ^3$ is a linear combination $c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2+c_3vec(v)_3$ where $vec(v)_1$ is a member of the $x$-axis, etc., in this way $ [w_1 w_2 w_3] =1·[w_1 0 0] +1·[0 w_2 0] +1·[0 0 w_3] $ and so $$x$-axis+$y$-axis+$z$-axis= ℝ^3$.   For example A sum of subspaces can be less than the entire space. Inside of $ polyspace(_4) $, let $ L $ be the subspace of linear polynomials ${a+bx such that a,b in ℝ}$ and let $ C $ be the subspace of purely-cubic polynomials $ {cx^3 such that c in ℝ}$. Then $L+C$ is not all of $polyspace(_4)$. Instead, $L+C$={a+bx+cx^3 such that a,b,c in ℝ} $.   For example A space can be described as a combination of subspaces in more than one way. Besides the decomposition $ ℝ^3=$x$-axis+$y$-axis+$z$-axis$, we can also write $ ℝ^3=$xy$-plane+$yz$-plane$. To check this, note that any $vec(w) in ℝ^3$ can be written as a linear combination of a member of the $xy$-plane and a member of the $yz$-plane; here are two such combinations. $ [w_1 w_2 w_3] =1·[w_1 w_2 0] +1·[0 0 w_3]  [w_1 w_2 w_3] =1·[w_1 w_2/2 0] +1·[0 w_2/2 w_3] $   The above definition gives one way in which we can think of a space as a combination of some of its parts. However, the prior example shows that there is at least one interesting property of our benchmark model that is not captured by the definition of the sum of subspaces. In the familiar decomposition of $ ℝ^3$, we often speak of a vector's `$x$~part' or `$y$~part' or `$z$~part'. That is, in our prototype each vector has a unique decomposition into pieces from the parts making up the whole space. But in the decomposition used in , we cannot refer to the ``$xy$~part'' of a vector- these three sums $ [1 2 3] =[1 2 0] +[0 0 3] =[1 0 0] +[0 2 3] =[1 1 0] +[0 1 3] $ all describe the vector as comprised of something from the first plane plus something from the second plane, but the ``$xy$~part'' is different in each.                                    That is, when we consider how $ ℝ^3$ is put together from the three axes we might mean ``in such a way that every vector has at least one decomposition,'' which gives the definition above. But if we take it to mean ``in such a way that every vector has one and only one decomposition'' then we need another condition on combinations. To see what this condition is, recall that vectors are uniquely represented in terms of a basis. We can use this to break a space into a sum of subspaces such that any vector in the space breaks uniquely into a sum of members of those subspaces.  For example Consider $ ℝ^3$ with its standard basis $stdbasis(_3)=sequence{vec(e)_1,vec(e)_2,vec(e)_3}$. The subspace with the basis $B_1=sequence{vec(e)_1}$ is the $x$-axis, the subspace with the basis $B_2=sequence{vec(e)_2}$ is the $y$-axis, and the subspace with the basis $B_3=sequence{vec(e)_3}$ is the $z$-axis. The fact that any member of $ ℝ^3$ is expressible as a sum of vectors from these subspaces $ [x y z] =[x 0 0] +[0 y 0] +[0 0 z] $ reflects the fact that $stdbasis(_3)$ spans the space- this equation $ [x y z] =c_1[1 0 0] +c_2[0 1 0] +c_3[0 0 1] $ has a solution for any $x,y,z in ℝ$. And the fact that each such expression is unique reflects that fact that $stdbasis(_3)$ is linearly independent, so any equation like the one above has a unique solution.   For example We don't have to take the basis vectors one at a time, we can conglomerate them into larger sequences. Consider again the space $ ℝ^3$ and the vectors from the standard basis $stdbasis(_3)$. The subspace with the basis $B_1=sequence{vec(e)_1,vec(e)_3}$ is the $xz$-plane. The subspace with the basis $B_2=sequence{vec(e)_2}$ is the $y$-axis. As in the prior example, the fact that any member of the space is a sum of members of the two subspaces in one and only one way $ [x y z] =[x 0 z] +[0 y 0] $ is a reflection of the fact that these vectors form a basis- this equation $ [x y z] =(c_1[1 0 0] +c_3[0 0 1]) +c_2[0 1 0] $ has one and only one solution for any $x,y,z in ℝ$.        The concatenation  of the sequences $ B_1=sequence{vec(β)_{1,1},...,vec(β)_{1,n_1}}$, ..., $B_k=sequence{vec(β)_{k,1},...,vec(β)_{k,n_k}}$ adjoins them into a single sequence. $ cat{cat{B_1{B_2}}{·s}}{B_k}= sequence{vec(β)_{1,1},...,vec(β)_{1,n_1}, vec(β)_{2,1},...,vec(β)_{k,n_k} } $    Let $V$ be a vector space that is the sum of some of its subspaces $V=W_1+...+W_k$. Let $B_1$, ..., $B_k$ be bases for these subspaces. The following are equivalent.  The expression of any $vec(v) in V$ as a combination $vec(v)=vec(w)_1+...+vec(w)_k$ with $vec(w)_i in W_i$ is unique. The concatenation $cat{B_1{·s}}{B_k}$ is a basis for $V$. Among nonzero vectors from different $W_i$'s every linear relationship is trivial.        We will show that $(1)⇒(2)$, that $(2)⇒(3)$, and finally that $(3)⇒(1)$. For these arguments, observe that we can pass from a combination of $vec(w)$'s to a combination of $vec(β)$'s $ d_1vec(w)_1+...+d_kvec(w)_k = d_1(c_{1,1}vec(β)_{1,1}+...+c_{1,n_1}vec(β)_{1,n_1}) +... +d_k(c_{k,1}vec(β)_{k,1}+...+c_{k,n_k}vec(β)_{k,n_k}) = d_1c_{1,1}·vec(β)_{1,1} +... +d_kc_{k,n_k}·vec(β)_{k,n_k}  $ and vice versa (we can move from the bottom to the top by taking each $d_i$ to be $1$).  For $(1)⇒(2)$, assume that all decompositions are unique. We will show that $cat{B_1{·s}}{B_k}$ spans the space and is linearly independent. It spans the space because the assumption that $V=W_1+...+W_k$ means that every $vec(v)$ can be expressed as $vec(v)=vec(w)_1+...+vec(w)_k$, which translates by equation~($*$) to an expression of $vec(v)$ as a linear combination of the $vec(β)$'s from the concatenation. For linear independence, consider this linear relationship. $ 0=c_{1,1}vec(β)_{1,1}+...+c_{k,n_k}vec(β)_{k,n_k} $ Regroup as in ($*$) (that is, move from bottom to top) to get the decomposition $0=vec(w)_1+...+vec(w)_k$. Because the zero vector obviously has the decomposition $0=0+...+0$, the assumption that decompositions are unique shows that each $vec(w)_i$ is the zero vector. This means that $c_{i,1}vec(β)_{i,1}+...+c_{i,n_i}vec(β)_{i,n_i}=0$, and since each $B_i$ is a basis we have the desired conclusion that all of the $c$'s are zero.  For $(2)⇒(3)$ assume that the concatenation of the bases is a basis for the entire space. Consider a linear relationship among nonzero vectors from different $W_i$'s. This might or might not involve a vector from $W_1$, or one from $W_2$, etc., so we write it $0=·s+d_ivec(w)_i+·s$. As in equation~($*$) expand the vector. $ 0 = ... +d_i(c_{i,1}vec(β)_{i,1}+...+c_{i,n_i}vec(β)_{i,n_i}) +·s = ... +d_ic_{i,1}·vec(β)_{i,1} +...+ d_ic_{i,n_i}·vec(β)_{i,n_i} +·s $ The linear independence of $cat{B_1{·s}}{B_k}$ gives that each coefficient $d_ic_{i,j}$ is zero. Since $vec(w)_i$ is nonzero vector, at least one of the $c_{i,j}$'s is not zero, and thus $d_i$ is zero. This holds for each $d_i$, and therefore the linear relationship is trivial.  Finally, for $(3)⇒(1)$, assume that among nonzero vectors from different $W_i$'s any linear relationship is trivial. Consider two decompositions of a vector $vec(v)=·s+vec(w)_i+·s$ and $vec(v)=·s+vec(u)_j+·s$ where $vec(w)_i in W_i$ and $vec(u)_j in W_j$. Subtract one from the other to get a linear relationship, something like this (if there is no $vec(u)_i$ or $vec(w)_j$ then leave those out). $ 0 =·s+(vec(w)_i-vec(u)_i) +·s +(vec(w)_j-vec(u)_j)+·s $ The case assumption that statement~(3) holds implies that the terms each equal the zero vector $vec(w)_i-vec(u)_i=0$. Hence decompositions are unique.    A collection of subspaces $ {W_1,..., W_k} $ is independent if no nonzero vector from any $ W_i $ is a linear combination of vectors from the other subspaces $ W_1,..., W_{i-1},W_{i+1},..., W_k $.    A vector space $ V $ is the direct sum (or internal direct sum ) of its subspaces $ W_1,..., W_k $ if $ V=W_1+W_2+... +W_k $ and the collection $ {W_1,..., W_k} $ is independent. We write $ V=W_1⊕ W_2⊕ ·s⊕ W_k $.   For example Our prototype works: $ ℝ^3=$x$-axis⊕$y$-axis⊕$z$-axis$.   For example The space of $ N by N $ matrices is this direct sum. $ {([ a 0 0 d ]) such that a,d in ℝ } ⊕ {([ 0 b 0 0 ]) such that b in ℝ } ⊕ {([ 0 0 c 0 ]) such that c in ℝ } $ It is the direct sum of subspaces in many other ways as well; direct sum decompositions are not unique.    The dimension of a direct sum is the sum of the dimensions of its summands.    In , the number of basis vectors in the concatenation equals the sum of the number of vectors in the sub-bases.   The special case of two subspaces is worth its own mention.   When a vector space is the direct sum of two of its subspaces then they are complements.      A vector space $ V $ is the direct sum of two of its subspaces $ W_1 $ and $ W_2 $ if and only if it is the sum of the two $ V=W_1+W_2 $ and their intersection is trivial $ W_1 intersection W_2={0} $.    Suppose first that $V=W_1⊕ W_2$. By definition, $V$ is the sum of the two $V=W_1+ W_2$. To show that their intersection is trivial let $vec(v)$ be a vector from $W_1 intersection W_2$ and consider the equation $vec(v)=vec(v)$. On that equation's left side is a member of $W_1$ and on the right is a member of $W_2$, which we can think of as a linear combination of members of $W_2$. But the two spaces are independent so the only way that a member of $W_1$ can be a linear combination of vectors from $W_2$ is if that member is the zero vector $vec(v)=0$.  For the other direction, suppose that $V$ is the sum of two spaces with a trivial intersection. To show that $V$ is a direct sum of the two we need only show that the spaces are independent- that no nonzero member of the first is expressible as a linear combination of members of the second, and vice versa. This holds because any relationship $vec(w)_1=c_1vec(w)_{2,1}+...+c_kvec(w)_{2,k}$ (with $vec(w)_1 in W_1$ and $vec(w)_{2,j} in W_2$ for all $j$) shows that the vector on the left is also in $W_2$, since the right side is a combination of members of $W_2$. The intersection of these two spaces is trivial, so $vec(w)_1=0$. The same argument works for any $vec(w)_2$.               For example In $ ℝ^2$ the $ x $-axis and the $ y $-axis are complements, that is, $ ℝ^2=$x$-axis⊕$y$-axis$. A space can have more than one pair of complementary subspaces; another pair for~$ ℝ^2$ are the subspaces consisting of the lines $ y=x $ and $ y=2x $.   For example In the space $ F={acos(θ+b)sin(θ) such that a,b in ℝ} $, the subspaces $ W_1={acos(θ) such that a in ℝ} $ and $ W_2={bsin(θ) such that b in ℝ} $ are complements. The prior example noted that a space can be decomposed into more than one pair of complements. In addition note that $F$ can has more than one pair of complementary subspaces where the first in the pair is $W_1$- another complement of $ W_1 $ is $ W_3={bsin(θ+b)cos(θ) such that b in ℝ} $.   For example In $ ℝ^3 $, the $ xy $-plane and the $ yz $-planes are not complements, which is the point of the discussion following . One complement of the $ xy $-plane is the $ z $-axis.    Here is a natural question that arises from :~for $k>2$ is the simple sum $V=W_1+...+W_k$ also a direct sum if and only if the intersection of the subspaces is trivial?  For example If there are more than two subspaces then having a trivial intersection is not enough to guarantee unique decomposition (i.e., is not enough to ensure that the spaces are independent). In $ ℝ^3 $, let $ W_1 $ be the $ x $-axis, let $ W_2 $ be the $ y $-axis, and let $W_3$ be this. $ W_3={[q q r] such that q,r in ℝ} $ The check that $ ℝ^3=W_1+W_2+W_3 $ is easy. The intersection $ W_1 intersection W_2 intersection W_3 $ is trivial, but decompositions aren't unique. $ [x y z] =[0 0 0] +[0 y-x 0] +[x x z] =[x-y 0 0] +[0 0 0] +[y y z] $ (This example also shows that this requirement is also not enough:~that all pairwise intersections of the subspaces be trivial. See .)   In this subsection we have seen two ways to regard a space as built up from component parts. Both are useful; in particular we will use the direct sum definition at the end of the Chapter Five.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Decide if $ ℝ^2 $ is the direct sum of each $ W_1 $ and $ W_2 $.  $ W_1={[x 0] such that x in ℝ} $, $ W_2={[x x] such that x in ℝ} $ $ W_1={[s s] such that s in ℝ} $, $ W_2={[s 1.1s] such that s in ℝ} $ $ W_1= ℝ^2 $, $ W_2={0} $ $ W_1=W_2={[t t] such that t in ℝ} $ $ W_1={[1 0]+[x 0] such that x in ℝ} $, $ W_2={[-1 0]+[0 y] such that y in ℝ} $   With each of these we can apply .  Yes. The plane is the sum of this $W_1$ and $W_2$ because for any scalars $a$ and $b$ $ [a b] =[a-b 0] +[b b] $ shows that the general vector is a sum of vectors from the two parts. And, these two subspaces are (different) lines through the origin, and so have a trivial intersection. Yes. To see that any vector in the plane is a combination of vectors from these parts, consider this relationship. $ [a b]=c_1[1 1]+c_2[1 1.1] $ We could now simply note that the set $ {[1 1],[1 1.1]} $ is a basis for the space (because it is clearly linearly independent, and has size two in $ ℝ^2$), and thus there is one and only one solution to the above equation, implying that all decompositions are unique. Alternatively, we can solve $ $ c_1 + c_2 = a c_1 + 1.1c_2 = b $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ c_1 + c_2 = a 0.1c_2 = -a+b $ $ to get that $c_2=10(-a+b)$ and $c_1=11a-10b$, and so we have $ [a b]=[11a-10b 11a-10b] +[-10a+10b 1.1·(-10a+10b)] $ as required. As with the prior answer, each of the two subspaces is a line through the origin, and their intersection is trivial. Yes. Each vector in the plane is a sum in this way $ [x y]=[x y]+[0 0] $ and the intersection of the two subspaces is trivial. No. The intersection is not trivial. No. These are not subspaces.    Show that $ ℝ^3 $ is the direct sum of the $ xy $-plane with each of these.  the $ z $-axis the line $ {[z z z] such that z in ℝ } $   With each of these we can use .  Any vector in $ ℝ^3 $ can be decomposed as this sum. $ [x y z] =[x y 0] +[0 0 z] $ And, the intersection of the $xy$-plane and the $z$-axis is the trivial subspace. Any vector in $ ℝ^3 $ can be decomposed as $ [x y z] =[x-z y-z 0] +[z z z] $ and the intersection of the two spaces is trivial.    Is $ polyspace(_2) $ the direct sum of $ {a+bx^2 such that a,b in ℝ} $ and $ {cx such that c in ℝ} $?  It is. Showing that these two are subspaces is routine. To see that the space is the direct sum of these two, just note that each member of $ polyspace(_2) $ has the unique decomposition $ m+nx+px^2=(m+px^2)+(nx) $.   In $ polyspace(_n) $, the even polynomials are the members of this set $ 𝓔= {p inpolyspace(_n) such that {$ p(-x)=p(x) $ for all $ x $} $ and the odd polynomials are the members of this set. $ 𝒪= {p inpolyspace(_n) such that text{{$ p(-x)=-p(x) $ for all $ x $}} $ Show that these are complementary subspaces.  To show that they are subspaces is routine. We will argue they are complements with . The intersection $ 𝓔 intersection𝒪 $ is trivial because the only polynomial satisfying both conditions $p(-x)=p(x)$ and $p(-x)=-p(x)$ is the zero polynomial. To see that the entire space is the sum of the subspaces $ 𝓔+𝒪=polyspace(_n) $, note that the polynomials $ p_0(x)=1 $, $ p_2(x)=x^2 $, $ p_4(x)=x^4 $, etc., are in $ 𝓔 $ and also note that the polynomials $ p_1(x)=x $, $ p_3(x)=x^3 $, etc., are in $ 𝒪 $. Hence any member of $ polyspace(_n) $ is a combination of members of $ 𝓔 $ and $ 𝒪 $.   Which of these subspaces of $ ℝ^3 $   $W_1$: the $ x $-axis, $W_2$:~the $ y $-axis, $W_3$:~the $ z $-axis, $W_4$:~the plane $ x+y+z=0 $, $W_5$:~the $ yz $-plane   can be combined to  sum to $ ℝ^3 $? direct sum to $ ℝ^3 $?   Each of these is $ ℝ^3$.   These are broken into some separate lines for readability.   $W_1+W_2+W_3$, $W_1+W_2+W_3+W_4$, $W_1+W_2+W_3+W_5$, $W_1+W_2+W_3+W_4+W_5$, $W_1+W_2+W_4$, $W_1+W_2+W_4+W_5$, $W_1+W_2+W_5$, $W_1+W_3+W_4$, $W_1+W_3+W_5$, $W_1+W_3+W_4+W_5$, $W_1+W_4$, $W_1+W_4+W_5$, $W_1+W_5$, $W_2+W_3+W_4$, $W_2+W_3+W_4+W_5$, $W_2+W_4$, $W_2+W_4+W_5$, $W_3+W_4$, $W_3+W_4+W_5$, $W_4+W_5$    $W_1⊕ W_2⊕ W_3$, $W_1⊕ W_4$, $W_1⊕ W_5$, $W_2⊕ W_4$, $W_3⊕ W_4$    Show that $ polyspace(_n)={a_0 such that a_0 in ℝ}⊕... ⊕{a_nx^n such that a_n in ℝ} $.  Clearly each is a subspace. The bases $ B_i=x^i $ for the subspaces, when concatenated, form a basis for the whole space.   What is $ W_1+W_2 $ if $ W_1⊆ W_2 $?  It is $ W_2 $.   Does generalize? That is, is this true or false:~if a vector space $ V $ has a basis $ sequence{vec(β)_1,... ,vec(β)_n} $ then it is the direct sum of the spans of the one-dimensional subspaces $ V=span({vec{{β)_1}}⊕... ⊕span({vec{{β)_n}} $?  True by .   Can $ ℝ^4 $ be decomposed as a direct sum in two different ways? Can $ ℝ^1 $?  Two distinct direct sum decompositions of $ ℝ^4 $ are easy to find. Two such are $ W_1=span({vec{{e)_1,vec{{e}_2}} $ and $ W_2=span({vec{{e)_3,vec{{e}_4}} $, and also $ U_1=span({vec{{e)_1}} $ and $ U_2=span({vec{{e)_2,vec{{e}_3,vec{{e}_4}} $. (Many more are possible, for example $ ℝ^4 $ and its trivial subspace.)  In contrast, any partition of $ ℝ^1 $'s single-vector basis will give one basis with no elements and another with a single element. Thus any decomposition involves $ ℝ^1 $ and its trivial subspace.   This exercise makes the notation of writing `$+$' between sets more natural. Prove that, where $ W_1,..., W_k $ are subspaces of a vector space, $ W_1+...+W_k ={vec{{w}_1+vec{{w}_2+...+vec{{w}_k such that vec(w)_1 in W_1,...,vec(w)_k in W_k}, $ and so the sum of subspaces is the subspace of all sums.  Set inclusion one way is easy: $ {vec{{w}_1+...+vec{{w}_k such that vec{{w}_i in W_i} $ is a subset of $ span(W_1∪ ... ∪ W_k) $ because each $ vec(w)_1+...+vec(w)_k $ is a sum of vectors from the union.  For the other inclusion, to any linear combination of vectors from the union apply commutativity of vector addition to put vectors from $ W_1 $ first, followed by vectors from $ W_2 $, etc. Add the vectors from $ W_1 $ to get a $ vec(w)_1 in W_1 $, add the vectors from $ W_2 $ to get a $ vec(w)_2 in W_2 $, etc. The result has the desired form.   (Refer to . This exercise shows that the requirement that pairwise intersections be trivial is genuinely stronger than the requirement only that the intersection of all of the subspaces be trivial.) Give a vector space and three subspaces $W_1$, $W_2$, and $W_3$ such that the space is the sum of the subspaces, the intersection of all three subspaces $W_1 intersection W_2 intersection W_3$ is trivial, but the pairwise intersections $W_1 intersection W_2$, $W_1 intersection W_3$, and $W_2 intersection W_3$ are nontrivial.  One example is to take the space to be $ ℝ^3$, and to take the subspaces to be the $xy$-plane, the $xz$-plane, and the $yz$-plane.   Prove that if $ V=W_1⊕...⊕ W_k $ then $ W_i intersection W_j $ is trivial whenever $ i ≠ j $. This shows that the first half of the proof of extends to the case of more than two subspaces. ( shows that this implication does not reverse; the other half does not extend.)  Of course, the zero vector is in all of the subspaces, so the intersection contains at least that one vector.. By the definition of direct sum the set $ {W_1,...,W_k} $ is independent and so no nonzero vector of $ W_i $ is a multiple of a member of $ W_j $, when $ i ≠ j $. In particular, no nonzero vector from $ W_i $ equals a member of $ W_j $.   Recall that no linearly independent set contains the zero vector. Can an independent set of subspaces contain the trivial subspace?  It can contain a trivial subspace; this set of subspaces of $ ℝ^3 $ is independent: $ {set{{0},{$ x $-axis} $. No nonzero vector from the trivial space $ {0} $ is a multiple of a vector from the $ x $-axis, simply because the trivial space has no nonzero vectors to be candidates for such a multiple (and also no nonzero vector from the $ x $-axis is a multiple of the zero vector from the trivial subspace).   Does every subspace have a complement?  Yes. For any subspace of a vector space we can take any basis $ sequence{vec(ω)_1,...,vec(ω)_k} $ for that subspace and extend it to a basis $ sequence{vec(ω)_1,...,vec(ω)_k, vec(β)_{k+1},...,vec(β)_n} $ for the whole space. Then the complement of the original subspace has this basis $ sequence{vec(β)_{k+1},...,vec(β)_n} $.   Let $ W_1, W_2 $ be subspaces of a vector space.  Assume that the set $ S_1 $ spans $ W_1 $, and that the set $ S_2 $ spans $ W_2 $. Can $ S_1∪ S_2 $ span $ W_1+W_2 $? Must it? Assume that $ S_1 $ is a linearly independent subset of $ W_1 $ and that $ S_2 $ is a linearly independent subset of $ W_2 $. Can $ S_1∪ S_2 $ be a linearly independent subset of $ W_1+W_2 $? Must it?    It must. We can write any member of $ W_1+W_2 $ as $ vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2 $ where $ vec(w)_1 in W_1 $ and $ vec(w)_2 in W_2 $. As $ S_1 $ spans $ W_1 $, the vector $ vec(w)_1 $ is a combination of members of $ S_1 $. Similarly $ vec(w)_2 $ is a combination of members of $ S_2 $. An easy way to see that it can be linearly independent is to take each to be the empty set. On the other hand, in the space $ ℝ^1$, if $ W_1= ℝ^1 $ and $ W_2= ℝ^1 $ and $S_1={1}$ and $S_2={2}$, then their union $S_1∪ S_2$ is not independent.    When we decompose a vector space as a direct sum, the dimensions of the subspaces add to the dimension of the space. The situation with a space that is given as the sum of its subspaces is not as simple. This exercise considers the two-subspace special case.  For these subspaces of $ matspace(_){N by N} $ find $ W_1 intersection W_2 $, $ dim(W_1 intersection W_2) $, $ W_1+W_2 $, and $ dim(W_1+W_2) $. $ W_1={([ 0 0 c d ]) such that c,d in ℝ }  W_2={([ 0 b c 0 ]) such that b,c in ℝ } $ Suppose that $ U $ and $ W $ are subspaces of a vector space. Suppose that the sequence $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_k} $ is a basis for $ U intersection W $. Finally, suppose that the prior sequence has been expanded to give a sequence $ sequence{vec(μ)_1,...,vec(μ)_j, vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_k} $ that is a basis for $ U $, and a sequence $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_k, vec(ω)_1,...,vec(ω)_p} $ that is a basis for $ W $. Prove that this sequence $ sequence{vec(μ)_1,...,vec(μ)_j, vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_k, vec(ω)_1,...,vec(ω)_p} $ is a basis for the sum $ U+W $. Conclude that $dim (U+W)=dim(U)+dim(W)-dim(U intersection W)$. Let $ W_1 $ and $ W_2 $ be eight-dimensional subspaces of a ten-di-men-sion-al space. List all values possible for $ dim(W_1 intersection W_2) $.    The intersection and sum are $ {([ 0 0 c 0 ]) such that c in ℝ }  {([ 0 b c d ]) such that b,c,d in ℝ } $ which have dimensions one and three. We write $B_{U intersection W}$ for the basis for $U intersection W$, we write $B_U$ for the basis for $U$, we write $B_W$ for the basis for $W$, and we write $B_{U+W}$ for the basis under consideration.  To see that $B_{U+W}$ spans $U+W$, observe that we can write any vector $cvec(u)+dvec(w)$ from $U+W$ as a linear combination of the vectors in $B_{U+W}$, simply by expressing $vec(u)$ in terms of $B_U$ and expressing $vec(w)$ in terms of $B_W$.  We finish by showing that $B_{U+W}$ is linearly independent. Consider $ c_1vec(μ)_1+...+c_{j+1}vec(β)_1+... +c_{j+k+p}vec(ω)_p=0 $ which can be rewritten in this way. $ c_1vec(μ)_1+...+c_jvec(μ)_j= -c_{j+1}vec(β)_1-...-c_{j+k+p}vec(ω)_p $ Note that the left side sums to a vector in $ U $ while right side sums to a vector in $ W $, and thus both sides sum to a member of $U intersection W$. Since the left side is a member of $U intersection W$, it is expressible in terms of the members of $B_{U intersection W}$, which gives the combination of $vec(μ)$'s from the left side above as equal to a combination of $vec(β)$'s. But, the fact that the basis $B_U$ is linearly independent shows that any such combination is trivial, and in particular, the coefficients $c_1$, ..., $c_j$ from the left side above are all zero. Similarly, the coefficients of the $ vec(ω) $'s are all zero. This leaves the above equation as a linear relationship among the $ vec(β) $'s, but $B_{U intersection W}$ is linearly independent, and therefore all of the coefficients of the $vec(β)$'s are also zero. Just count the basis vectors in the prior item:~$dim(U+W)=j+k+p$, and $dim(U)=j+k$, and $dim(W)=k+p$, and $dim(U intersection W)=k$. We know that $ dim(W_1+W_2)=dim(W_1)+dim(W_2)-dim(W_1 intersection W_2) $. Because $ W_1⊆ W_1+W_2 $, we know that $ W_1+W_2 $ must have dimension greater than that of $W_1$, that is, must have dimension eight, nine, or ten. Substituting gives us three possibilities $8=8+8-dim(W_1 intersection W_2)$ or $9=8+8-dim(W_1 intersection W_2)$ or $10=8+8-dim(W_1 intersection W_2)$. Thus $ dim(W_1 intersection W_2) $ must be either eight, seven, or six. (Giving examples to show that each of these three cases is possible is easy, for instance in $ ℝ^{10} $.)    Let $ V=W_1⊕·s⊕ W_k $ and for each index $ i $ suppose that $ S_i $ is a linearly independent subset of $ W_i $. Prove that the union of the $ S_i $'s is linearly independent.  Expand each $ S_i $ to a basis $B_i$ for $ W_i $. The concatenation of those bases $cat{B_1{·s}}{B_k}$ is a basis for $ V $ and thus its members form a linearly independent set. But the union $S_1∪·s∪ S_k$ is a subset of that linearly independent set, and thus is itself linearly independent.   A matrix is symmetric  if for each pair of indices $ i $ and $ j $, the $ i,j $ entry equals the $ j,i $ entry. A matrix is antisymmetric  if each $ i,j $ entry is the negative of the $ j,i $ entry.  Give a symmetric $N by N$ matrix and an antisymmetric $N by N$ matrix. (Remark. For the second one, be careful about the entries on the diagonal.) What is the relationship between a square symmetric matrix and its transpose? Between a square antisymmetric matrix and its transpose? Show that $ matspace(_){N by N} $ is the direct sum of the space of symmetric matrices and the space of antisymmetric matrices.    Two such are these. $ ([ 1 2 2 3 ])  ([ 0 1 -1 0 ]) $ For the antisymmetric one, entries on the diagonal must be zero. A square symmetric matrix equals its transpose. A square antisymmetric matrix equals the negative of its transpose. Showing that the two sets are subspaces is easy. Suppose that $ A inmatspace(_){N by N} $. To express $A$ as a sum of a symmetric and an antisymmetric matrix, we observe that $ A=(1/2)(A+Aᵀ) + (1/2)(A-Aᵀ) $ and note the first summand is symmetric while the second is antisymmetric. Thus $ matspace(_){N by N} $ is the sum of the two subspaces. To show that the sum is direct, assume a matrix $ A $ is both symmetric $ A=Aᵀ $ and antisymmetric $ A=-Aᵀ $. Then $ A=-A $ and so all of $ A $'s entries are zeroes.    Let $ W_1,W_2,W_3 $ be subspaces of a vector space. Prove that $ (W_1 intersection W_2)+(W_1 intersection W_3)⊆ W_1 intersection (W_2+W_3) $. Does the inclusion reverse?  Assume that $ vec(v) in (W_1 intersection W_2)+(W_1 intersection W_3) $. Then $ vec(v)=vec(w)_2+vec(w)_3 $ where $ vec(w)_2 in W_1 intersection W_2 $ and $ vec(w)_3 in W_1 intersection W_3 $. Note that $ vec(w)_2,vec(w)_3 in W_1 $ and, as a subspace is closed under addition, $ vec(w)_2+vec(w)_3 in W_1 $. Thus $ vec(v)=vec(w)_2+vec(w)_3 in W_1 intersection(W_2+W_3) $.  This example proves that the inclusion may be strict: in $ ℝ^2 $ take $ W_1 $ to be the $ x $-axis, take $ W_2 $ to be the $ y $-axis, and take $ W_3 $ to be the line $ y=x $. Then $ W_1 intersection W_2 $ and $ W_1 intersection W_3 $ are trivial and so their sum is trivial. But $ W_2+W_3 $ is all of $ ℝ^2 $ so $ W_1 intersection(W_2+W_3) $ is the $ x $-axis.   The example of the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis in $ ℝ^2 $ shows that $ W_1⊕ W_2=V $ does not imply that $ W_1∪ W_2=V $. Can $ W_1⊕ W_2=V $ and $ W_1∪ W_2=V $ happen?  It happens when at least one of $ W_1,W_2 $ is trivial. But that is the only way it can happen.  To prove this, assume that both are non-trivial, select nonzero vectors $ vec(w)_1, vec(w)_2 $ from each, and consider $ vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2 $. This sum is not in $ W_1 $ because $ vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2=vec(v) in W_1 $ would imply that $ vec(w)_2=vec(v)-vec(w)_1 $ is in $ W_1 $, which violates the assumption of the independence of the subspaces. Similarly, $ vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2 $ is not in $ W_2 $. Thus there is an element of $ V $ that is not in $ W_1∪ W_2 $.                                                               Consider . Does it work both ways- that is, supposing that $ V=W_1+...+ W_k $, is $ V=W_1⊕·s⊕ W_k $ if and only if $ dim(V)=dim(W_1)+...+dim(W_k) $?  Yes. The left-to-right implication is . For the other direction, assume that $ dim(V)=dim(W_1)+...+dim(W_k) $. Let $ B_1,..., B_k $ be bases for $ W_1,..., W_k $. As $V$ is the sum of the subspaces, we can write any $ vec(v) in V $ as $ vec(v)=vec(w)_1+·s+vec(w)_k $ and expressing each $ vec(w)_i $ as a combination of vectors from the associated basis $ B_i $ shows that the concatenation $ B_1{·s{B_k}} $ spans $ V $. Now, that concatenation has $ dim(W_1)+...+dim(W_k) $ members, and so it is a spanning set of size $ dim(V) $. The concatenation is therefore a basis for $ V $. Thus $ V $ is the direct sum.   We know that if $ V=W_1⊕ W_2 $ then there is a basis for $ V $ that splits into a basis for $ W_1 $ and a basis for $ W_2 $. Can we make the stronger statement that every basis for $ V $ splits into a basis for $ W_1 $ and a basis for $ W_2 $?  No. The standard basis for $ ℝ^2 $ does not split into bases for the complementary subspaces the line $ x=y $ and the line $ x=-y $.   We can ask about the algebra of the `$+$' operation.  Is it commutative; is $ W_1+W_2=W_2+W_1 $? Is it associative; is $ (W_1+W_2)+W_3=W_1+(W_2+W_3) $? Let $ W $ be a subspace of some vector space. Show that $ W+W=W $. Must there be an identity element, a subspace $ I $ such that $ I+W=W+I=W $ for all subspaces $ W $? Does left-cancellation hold:~if $ W_1+W_2=W_1+W_3 $ then $ W_2=W_3 $? Right cancellation?    Yes, $ W_1+W_2=W_2+W_1 $ for all subspaces $ W_1,W_2 $ because each side is the span of $ W_1∪ W_2=W_2∪ W_1 $. This one is similar to the prior one- each side of that equation is the span of $ (W_1∪ W_2)∪ W_3=W_1∪ (W_2∪ W_3) $. Because this is an equality between sets, we can show that it holds by mutual inclusion. Clearly $ W⊆ W+W $. For $ W+W⊆ W $ just recall that every subset is closed under addition so any sum of the form $ vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2 $ is in $ W $. In each vector space, the identity element with respect to subspace addition is the trivial subspace. Neither of left or right cancellation needs to hold. For an example, in $ ℝ^3 $ take $ W_1 $ to be the $ xy $-plane, take $ W_2 $ to be the $ x $-axis, and take $ W_3 $ to be the $ y $-axis.                                                             Computations involving only integers or only rational numbers are much easier than those with real numbers. Could other algebraic structures, such as the integers or the rationals, work in the place of $ ℝ $ in the definition of a vector space?  If we take ``work'' to mean that the results of this chapter remain true then there is a natural list of conditions that a structure (that is, number system) must have in order to work in the place of $ ℝ$. A field is a set $ 𝔽 $ with operations `$ + $' and `$ · $' such that  for any $ a,b in𝔽 $ the result of $ a+b $ is in $ 𝔽 $, and $ a+b=b+a $, and if $ c in𝔽 $ then $ a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c $ for any $ a,b in𝔽 $ the result of $ a· b $ is in $ 𝔽 $, and $ a· b=b· a $, and if $ c in𝔽 $ then $ a· (b· c)=(a· b)· c $ if $ a,b,c in𝔽 $ then $ a· (b+c)=a· b+a· c $ there is an element $ 0 in𝔽 $ such that if $ a in𝔽 $ then $ a+0=a $, and for each $ a in𝔽 $ there is an element $ -a in𝔽 $ such that $ (-a)+a=0 $ there is an element $ 1 in𝔽 $ such that if $ a in𝔽 $ then $ a· 1=a $, and for each element $ a ≠ 0 $ of $ 𝔽 $ there is an element $ a^{-1} in𝔽 $ such that $ a^{-1}· a=1 $.   For example, the algebraic structure consisting of the set of real numbers along with its usual addition and multiplication operation is a field. Another field is the set of rational numbers with its usual addition and multiplication operations. An example of an algebraic structure that is not a field is the integers, because it fails the final condition.  Some examples are more surprising. The set $ 𝔹={0,1} $ under these operations:   $ + $ 0 $ 1 $  $ 0 $ 0 $ 1 $ $ 1 $ 1 $ 0 $    $ · $ 0 $ 1 $  $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ $ 1 $ 0 $ 1 $   is a field; see .  We could in this book develop Linear Algebra as the theory of vector spaces with scalars from an arbitrary field. In that case, almost all of the statements here would carry over by replacing `$ ℝ $' with `$ 𝔽 $', that is, by taking coefficients, vector entries, and matrix entries to be elements of $ 𝔽 $ (the exceptions are statements involving distances or angles, which would need additional development). Here are some examples; each applies to a vector space $ V $ over a field $ 𝔽 $.   [$*$] For any $ vec(v) in V $ and $ a in𝔽 $, (i)~$ 0·vec(v)=0 $, (ii)~$ -1·vec(v)+vec(v)=0 $, and (iii)~$ a·vec(0)=vec(0) $.  [$*$] The span, the set of linear combinations, of a subset of $ V $ is a subspace of $ V $.  [$*$] Any subset of a linearly independent set is also linearly independent.  [$*$] In a finite-dimensional vector space, any two bases have the same number of elements.  (Even statements that don't explicitly mention $ 𝔽 $ use field properties in their proof.)  We will not develop vector spaces in this more general setting because the additional abstraction can be a distraction. The ideas we want to bring out already appear when we stick to the reals.  The exception is Chapter Five. There we must factor polynomials, so we will switch to considering vector spaces over the field of complex numbers.    Check that the real numbers form a field.  Going through the five conditions shows that they are all familiar from elementary mathematics.   Prove that these are fields.  The rational numbers $Q$ The complex numbers $ ℂ$   As with the prior question, going through the five conditions shows that for both of these structures, the properties are familiar.   Give an example that shows that the integer number system is not a field.  The integers fail condition~(5). For instance, there is no multiplicative inverse for $2$- while $2$ is an integer, $1/2$ is not.   Check that the set $𝔹={0,1}$ is a field under the operations listed above,  We can do these checks by listing all of the possibilities. For instance, to verify the first half of condition~(2) we must check that the structure is closed under addition and that addition is commutative $a+b=b+a$, we can check both of these for all possible pairs $a$ and~$b$ because there are only four such pairs. Similarly, for associativity, there are only eight triples $a$, $b$, $c$, and so the check is not too long. (There are other ways to do the checks; in particular, you may recognize these operations as arithmetic modulo~$2$. But an exhaustive check is not onerous)   Give suitable operations to make the set ${0,1,2}$ a field.  These will do.   $ + $ 0 $ 1 $2$  $ 0 $ 0 $ 1 $2$ $ 1 $ 1 $ 2 $0$ $2$2$0$1$    $ · $ 0 $ 1 $2$  $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $0$ $ 1 $ 0 $ 1 $2$ $2$0$2$1$   As in the prior item, we could verify that they satisfy the conditions by listing all of the cases.             Everyone has noticed that table salt comes in little cubes.  includegraphics[height=1.25in]{salt.jpg}  This orderly outside arises from an orderly inside- the way the atoms lie is also cubical, these cubes stack in neat rows and columns, and the salt faces tend to be just an outer layer of cubes. One cube of atoms is shown below. Salt is sodium chloride and the small spheres shown are sodium while the big ones are chloride. To simplify the view, it only shows the sodiums and chlorides on the front, top, and right.    The specks of salt that we see above have many repetitions of this fundamental unit. A solid, such as table salt, with a regular internal structure is a crystal.  We can restrict our attention to the front face. There we have a square repeated many times giving a lattice of atoms.    The distance along the sides of each square cell is about $3.34$~AA(ngstroms) (an AA(ngstrom) is $10^{-10}$~meters). When we want to refer to atoms in the lattice that number is unwieldy, and so we take the square's side length as a unit. That is, we naturally adopt this basis. $ [ 3.34 0],[0 3.34] $ Now we can describe, say, the atom in the upper right of the lattice picture above as $3vec(β)_1+2vec(β)_2$, instead of $10.02$~AA(ngstroms) over and $6.68$~up.  Another crystal from everyday experience is pencil lead. It is graphite, formed from carbon atoms arranged in this shape.    This is a single plane of graphite, called graphene. A piece of graphite consists of many of these planes, layered. The chemical bonds between the planes are much weaker than the bonds inside the planes, which explains why pencils write- the graphite can be sheared so that the planes slide off and are left on the paper.  We can get a convenient unit of length by decomposing the hexagonal ring into three regions that are rotations of this unit cell.      The vectors that form the sides of that unit cell make a convenient basis. The distance along the bottom and slant is $1.42$~AA(ngstroms), so this $ [1.42 0], [0.71 1.23] $ is a good basis.  Another familiar crystal formed from carbon is diamond. Like table salt it is built from cubes but the structure inside each cube is more complicated. In addition to carbons at each corner,    there are carbons in the middle of each face.    (To show the new face carbons clearly, the corner carbons are reduced to dots.) There are also four more carbons inside the cube, two that are a quarter of the way up from the bottom and two that are a quarter of the way down from the top.    (As before, carbons shown earlier are reduced here to dots.) The distance along any edge of the cube is $2.18$~AA(ngstroms). Thus, a natural basis for describing the locations of the carbons and the bonds between them, is this. $ sequence{[2.18 0 0], [0 2.18 0], [0 0 2.18]} $  The examples here show that the structures of crystals is complicated enough to need some organized system to give the locations of the atoms and how they are chemically bound. One tool for that organization is a convenient basis. This application of bases is simple but it shows a science context where the idea arises naturally.     How many fundamental regions are there in one face of a speck of salt? (With a ruler, we can estimate that face is a square that is $0.1$~cm on a side.)  Each fundamental unit is $3.34× 10^{-10}$~cm, so there are about $0.1/(3.34× 10^{-10})$ such units. That gives $2.99× 10^{8}$, so there are something like $300,000,000$ (three hundred million) regions.   In the graphite picture, imagine that we are interested in a point $5.67$~AA(ngstroms) over and $3.14$~AA(ngstroms) up from the origin.  Express that point in terms of the basis given for graphite. How many hexagonal shapes away is this point from the origin? Express that point in terms of a second basis, where the first basis vector is the same, but the second is perpendicular to the first (going up the plane) and of the same length.    We solve $ c_1[1.42 0]+c_2[0.71 1.23] =[5.67 3.14] ⇒ $ 1.42c_1 + 0.71c_2 = 5.67 1.23c_2 = 3.14 $ $ to get $c_2≈ 2.72$ and $c_1≈ 2.55$. Here is the point located in the lattice. In the picture on the left, superimposed on the unit cell are the two basis vectors $vec(β)_1$ and $vec(β)_2$, and a box showing the offset of $2.55vec(β)_1+2.72vec(β)_2$. The picture on the right shows where that appears inside of the crystal lattice, taking as the origin the lower left corner of the hexagon in the lower left.      So this point is two columns of hexagons over and one hexagon up. This second basis $ [1.42 0],[0 1.42] $ makes the computation easier $ c_1[1.42 0]+c_2[0 1.42] =[5.67 3.14] ⇒ $ 1.42c_1 = 5.67 1.42c_2 = 3.14 $ $ (we get $c_2≈ 2.21$ and $c_1≈ 3.99$), but it doesn't seem to have to do much with the physical structure that we are studying.    Give the locations of the atoms in the diamond cube both in terms of the basis, and in AA(ngstroms).  In terms of the basis the locations of the corner atoms are $(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, ..., $(1,1,1)$. The locations of the face atoms are $(0.5,0.5,1)$, $(1,0.5,0.5)$, $(0.5,1,0.5)$, $(0,0.5,0.5)$, $(0.5,0,0.5)$, and $(0.5,0.5,0)$. The locations of the atoms a quarter of the way down from the top are $(0.75,0.75,0.75)$ and $(0.25,0.25,0.25)$. The atoms a quarter of the way up from the bottom are at $(0.75,0.25,0.25)$ and $(0.25,0.75,0.25)$. Converting to AA(ngstroms) is easy.   This illustrates how we could compute the dimensions of a unit cell from the shape in which a substance crystallizes (, p.~462).  Recall that there are $6.022× 10^{23}$ atoms in a mole (this is Avogadro's number). From that, and the fact that platinum has a mass of $195.08$ grams per mole, calculate the mass of each atom. Platinum crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice with atoms at each lattice point, that is, it looks like the middle picture given above for the diamond crystal. Find the number of platinum's per unit cell (hint:~sum the fractions of platinum's that are inside of a single cell). From that, find the mass of a unit cell. Platinum crystal has a density of $21.45$ grams per cubic centimeter. From this, and the mass of a unit cell, calculate the volume of a unit cell. Find the length of each edge. Describe a natural three-dimensional basis.    $195.08/6.02× 10^{23}=3.239× 10^{-22}$ Each platinum atom in the middle of each face is split between two cubes, so that is $6/2=3$ atoms so far. Each atom at a corner is split among eight cubes, so that makes an additional $8/8=1$~atom, so the total is $4$. $4· 3.239× 10^{-22}=1.296× 10^{-21}$ $1.296× 10^{-21}/21.45=6.042× 10^{-23}$ cubic centimeters $3.924× 10^{-8}$ centimeters.  $sequence{[3.924× 10^{-8] 0 0}, [0 3.924× 10^{-8] 0}, [0 0 3.924× 10^{-8]}}$             Imagine that a Political Science class studying the American presidential process holds a mock election. The $29$ class members rank the Democratic Party, Republican Party, and Third Party nominees, from most preferred to least preferred ($>$ means `is preferred to').    {[b] preference order } {{ [b] number with [-0.5ex] that preference }}   $Democrat > Republican > Third$ $Democrat > Third > Republican$ $Republican > Democrat > Third$ $Republican > Third > Democrat$ $Third > Democrat > Republican$ $Third > Republican > Democrat$   $5$ $4$ $2$ $8$ $8$ $2$     What is the preference of the group as a whole?  Overall, the group prefers the Democrat to the Republican by five votes; seventeen voters ranked the Democrat above the Republican versus twelve the other way. And the group prefers the Republican to the Third's nominee, fifteen to fourteen. But, strangely enough, the group also prefers the Third to the Democrat, eighteen to eleven.    This is a voting paradox , specifically, a majority cycle.  Mathematicians study voting paradoxes in part because of their implications for practical politics. For instance, the instructor can manipulate this class into choosing the Democrat as the overall winner by first asking for a vote between the Republican and the Third, and then asking for a vote between the winner of that contest, who will be the Republican, and the Democrat. By similar manipulations the instructor can make any of the other two candidates come out as the winner. (We will stick to three-candidate elections but the same thing happens in larger elections.)  Mathematicians also study voting paradoxes simply because they are interesting. One interesting aspect is that the group's overall majority cycle occurs despite that each single voter's preference list is rational , in a straight-line order. That is, the majority cycle seems to arise in the aggregate without being present in the components of that aggregate, the preference lists. However we can use linear algebra to argue that a tendency toward cyclic preference is actually present in each voter's list and that it surfaces when there is more adding of the tendency than canceling.  For this, abbreviating the choices as $D$, $R$, and $T$, we can describe how a voter with preference order $D>R>T$ contributes to the above cycle.    (The negative sign is here because the arrow describes $T$ as preferred to $D$, but this voter likes them the other way.) The descriptions for the other preference lists are in the table on page~pageref(table:Voting).  Now, to conduct the election we linearly combine these descriptions; for instance, the Political Science mock election $ 5· Voting graphic: 43 +4·Voting graphic: 44 +...+2·Voting graphic: 45 $ yields the circular group preference shown earlier.  Of course, taking linear combinations is linear algebra. The graphical cycle notation is suggestive but inconvenient so we use column vectors by starting at the $D$ and taking the numbers from the cycle in counterclockwise order. Thus, we represent the mock election and a single $D>R>T$ vote in this way. $ (7, 1, 5) and (-1, 1, 1) $  We will decompose vote vectors into two parts, one cyclic and the other acyclic. For the first part, we say that a vector is purely cyclic if it is in this subspace of $ ℝ^3$. $ C ={votepreflist{{k}{{k}{{k} such that k in ℝ} ={k·votepreflist{{1}{{1}{{1} such that k in ℝ} $ For the second part, consider the set of vectors that are perpendicular to all of the vectors in $C$. shows that this is a subspace $ C^perp={votepreflist{{c_1}{{c_2}{{c_3} such that [c_1 c_2 c_3]dot product of [k k k] =0 for all $k in ℝ$} ={votepreflist{{c_1}{{c_2}{{c_3} such that c_1+c_2+c_3=0} ={c_2votepreflist{{-1}{{1}{{0} +c_3(-1, 0, 1) such that c_2,c_3 in ℝ} $ (read that aloud as ``$C$~perp''). So we are led to this basis for $ ℝ^3$. $ sequence{(1, 1, 1), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, 0, 1)} $ We can represent votes with respect to this basis, and thereby decompose them into a cyclic part and an acyclic part. textit{(Note for readers who have covered the optional section in this chapter:~that is, the space is the direct sum of $C$ and~$C^perp$.)}  For example, consider the $D>R>T$ voter discussed above. We represent that voter with respect to the basis $ $ c_1 - c_2 - c_3 = -1 c_1 + c_2 = 1 c_1 + c_3 = 1 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $(-1/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ c_1 - c_2 - c_3 = -1 2c_2 + c_3 = 2 (3/2)c_3 = 1 $ $ using the coordinates $c_1=1/3$, $c_2=2/3$, and $c_3=2/3$. Then $ (-1, 1, 1) =(1/3)·(1, 1, 1) +(2/3)·(-1, 1, 0) +(2/3)·(-1, 0, 1) =(1/3, 1/3, 1/3) +(-4/3, 2/3, 2/3) $ gives the desired decomposition into a cyclic part and an acyclic part. $ Voting graphic: 3 = Voting graphic: 4 + Voting graphic: 5 $ Thus we can see that this $D>R>T$ voter's rational preference list does have a cyclic part.  The $T>R>D$ voter is opposite to the one just considered in that the `$>$' symbols are reversed. This voter's decomposition $ Voting graphic: 6 = Voting graphic: 7 + Voting graphic: 8 $ shows that these opposite preferences have decompositions that are opposite. We say that the first voter has positive spin since the cycle part is with the direction that we have chosen for the arrows, while the second voter's spin is negative.  The fact that these opposite voters cancel each other is reflected in the fact that their vote vectors add to zero. This suggests an alternate way to tally an election. We could first cancel as many opposite preference lists as possible and then determine the outcome by adding the remaining lists.  The table below contains the three pairs of opposite preference lists. For instance, the top line contains the voters discussed above.  defbetweenrowvspace(5.5ex) [hsize][l]{   {positive spin} {negative spin}  {  $Democrat>Republican>Third$ $Voting graphic: 9 =Voting graphic: 10 + Voting graphic: 11$ } {  $Third>Republican>Democrat$ $Voting graphic: 12 =Voting graphic: 13 + Voting graphic: 14$ } [betweenrowvspace] {  $Republican>Third>Democrat$ $Voting graphic: 15 =Voting graphic: 16 + Voting graphic: 17$ } {  $Democrat>Third>Republican$ $Voting graphic: 18 =Voting graphic: 19 + Voting graphic: 20$ } [betweenrowvspace] {  $Third>Democrat>Republican$ $Voting graphic: 21 =Voting graphic: 22 + Voting graphic: 23$ } {  $Republican>Democrat>Third$ $Voting graphic: 24 =Voting graphic: 25 + Voting graphic: 26$ }  }   If we conduct the election as just described then after the cancellation of as many opposite pairs of voters as possible there will remain three sets of preference lists:~one set from the first row, one from the second row, and one from the third row. We will finish by proving that a voting paradox can happen only if the spins of these three sets are in the same direction. That is, for a voting paradox to occur the three remaining sets must all come from the left of the table or all come from the right (see ). This shows that there is some connection between the majority cycle and the decomposition that we are using- a voting paradox can happen only when the tendencies toward cyclic preference reinforce each other.  For the proof, assume that we have canceled opposite preference orders and are left with one set of preference lists for each of the three rows. Consider the first row's remaining preference lists. They could be from the first row's left or right (or between, since the lists could have canceled exactly). We shall write $ Voting graphic: 27 $ where $a$ is an integer that is positive if the remaining lists are on the left, where $a$ is negative if the lists are on the right, and zero if the cancellation was perfect. Similarly we have integers $b$ and $c$ for the second and third rows, which can each be positive, negative, or zero.  Then the election is determined by this sum. $ Voting graphic: 27 + Voting graphic: 28 + Voting graphic: 29 = Voting graphic: 30  $ A voting paradox occurs when the three numbers in the total cycle on the right, $-a+b+c$ and $a-b+c$ and $a+b-c$, are all nonnegative or all nonpositive. We will prove this occurs only when either all three of $a$, $b$, and~$c$ are nonnegative or all three are nonpositive.  Let the total cycle numbers be nonnegative; the other case is similar. $ $ -a + b + c ≥ 0 a - b + c ≥ 0 a + b - c ≥ 0 $ $ Add the first two rows to see that $c≥ 0$. Add the first and third rows for $b≥ 0$. And, the second and third rows together give $a≥ 0$. Thus if the total cycle is nonnegative then in each row the remaining preference lists are from the table's left. That ends the proof.  This result says only that having all three spin in the same direction is a necessary condition for a majority cycle. It is not sufficient; see .  Voting theory and associated topics are the subject of current research. There are many intriguing results, notably those produced by K~Arrow who won the Nobel Prize in part for this work, showing that no voting system is entirely fair (for a reasonable definition of ``fair''). Some good introductory articles are , , , and . is a readable text. The long list of cases from recent American political history in shows these paradoxes are routinely manipulated in practice. (On the other hand, quite recent research shows that computing how to manipulate elections can in general be unfeasible, but this is beyond our scope.) This Topic is drawn from . mph{(Author's Note:~I would like to thank Professor~Zwicker for his kind and illuminating discussions.)}    Here is a reasonable way in which a voter could have a cyclic preference. Suppose that this voter ranks each candidate on each of three criteria.  Draw up a table with the rows labeled `Democrat', `Republican', and `Third', and the columns labeled `character', `experience', and `policies'. Inside each column, rank some candidate as most preferred, rank another as in the middle, and rank the remaining one as least preferred. In this ranking, is the Democrat preferred to the Republican in (at least) two out of three criteria, or vice versa? Is the Republican preferred to the Third? Does the table that was just constructed have a cyclic preference order? If not, make one that does.  So it is possible for a voter to have a cyclic preference among candidates. The paradox described above, however, is that even if each voter has a straight-line preference list, a cyclic preference can still arise for the entire group.  This example yields a non-rational preference order for a single voter. skip   \ {character} {experience} {policies}  Democrat most middle least Republican middle least most Third least most middle    skip The Democrat is better than the Republican for character and experience. The Republican wins over the Third for character and policies. And, the Third beats the Democrat for experience and policies.   Compute the values in the table of decompositions.  First, compare the $D>R>T$ decomposition that was covered in the Topic $ (-1, 1, 1) =(1/3)·(1, 1, 1) +(2/3)·(-1, 1, 0) +(2/3)·(-1, 0, 1) $ with the decomposition of the opposite $T>R>D$ voter. $ (1, -1, -1) =d_1·(1, 1, 1) +d_2·(-1, 1, 0) +d_3·(-1, 0, 1) $ Obviously, the second is the negative of the first, and so $d_1=-1/3$, $d_2=-2/3$, and $d_3=-2/3$. This principle holds for any pair of opposite voters, and so we need only do the computation for a voter from the second row, and a voter from the third row. For a positive spin voter in the second row, $ $ c_1 - c_2 - c_3 = 1 c_1 + c_2 = 1 c_1 + c_3 = -1 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $(-1/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ c_1 - c_2 - c_3 = 1 2c_2 + c_3 = 0 (3/2)c_3 = -2 $ $ gives $c_3=-4/3$, $c_2=2/3$, and $c_1=1/3$. For a positive spin voter in the third row, $ $ c_1 - c_2 - c_3 = 1 c_1 + c_2 = -1 c_1 + c_3 = 1 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $(-1/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ c_1 - c_2 - c_3 = 1 2c_2 + c_3 = -2 (3/2)c_3 = 1 $ $ gives $c_3=2/3$, $c_2=-4/3$, and $c_1=1/3$.   Perform the cancellations of opposite preference orders for the Political Science class's mock election. Are all the remaining preferences from the left three rows of the table or from the right?  The mock election corresponds to the table on page~pageref(table:Voting) in the way shown in the first table, and after cancellation the result is the second table. skip    positive spin negative spin  $D>R>T$ 5 voters   $T>R>D$ 2 voters   $R>T>D$ 8 voters   $D>T>R$ 4 voters   $T>D>R$ 8 voters   $R>D>T$ 2 voters     positive spin negative spin  $D>R>T$ 3 voters   $T>R>D$ -canceled-   $R>T>D$ 4 voters   $D>T>R$ -canceled-   $T>D>R$ 6 voters   $R>D>T$ -canceled-    skip All three come from the same side of the table (the left), as the result from this Topic says must happen. Now we can tally, using the canceled numbers $  3· Voting graphic: 31             +4·Voting graphic: 32             +6·Voting graphic: 33             = Voting graphic: 34             $ to get the same outcome.   The necessary condition that a voting paradox can happen only if all three preference lists remaining after cancellation have the same spin is not also sufficient.        Give an example of a vote where there is a majority cycle and addition of one more voter with the same spin causes the cycle to go away. Can the opposite happen; can addition of one voter with a ``wrong'' spin cause a cycle to appear? Give a condition that is both necessary and sufficient to get a majority cycle.        A trivial example starts with the zero-voter election, which has a trivial majority cycle, and adds any one voter. A more interesting example takes the Political Science mock election and adds two $T>D>R$ voters (to satisfy the ``addition of one more voter'' criteria in the question we can add them one at a time). The new voters have positive spin, which is the spin of the votes remaining after cancellation in the original mock election. This is the resulting table of voters and next to it is the result of cancellation. skip    positive spin negative spin  $D>R>T$ 5 voters   $T>R>D$ 2 voters   $R>T>D$ 8 voters   $D>T>R$ 4 voters   $T>D>R$ 10 voters   $R>D>T$ 2 voters     positive spin negative spin  $D>R>T$ 3 voters   $T>R>D$ -canceled   $R>T>D$ 4 voters   $D>T>R$ -canceled-   $T>D>R$ 8 voters   $R>D>T$ -canceled-    skip This is the election using the canceled numbers. $  3·Voting graphic: 35             +4·Voting graphic: 36             +8·Voting graphic: 37             =Voting graphic: 38             $ The majority cycle has indeed disappeared. Reverse the prior exercise. That is, add a voter to the result of the prior exercise that cancels the one who made the cycle disappear. One such condition is that, after cancellation, all three be nonnegative or all three be nonpositive, and:~$|c|<|a+b|$ and $|b|<|a+c|$ and $|a|<|b+c|$. That follows from this diagram. $ Voting graphic: 27 + Voting graphic: 28 + Voting graphic: 29 = Voting graphic: 30  $            A one-voter election cannot have a majority cycle because of the requirement that we've imposed that the voter's list must be rational.  Show that a two-voter election may have a majority cycle. (We consider the group preference a majority cycle if all three group totals are nonnegative or if all three are nonpositive---that is, we allow some zero's in the group preference.) Show that for any number of voters greater than one, there is an election involving that many voters that results in a majority cycle.    A two-voter election can have a majority cycle in two ways. First, the two voters could be opposites, resulting after cancellation in the trivial election (with the majority cycle of all zeroes). Second, the two voters could have the same spin but come from different rows, as here. $  1· Voting graphic: 39             +1·Voting graphic: 40             +0·Voting graphic: 41             =Voting graphic: 42             $ There are two cases. An even number of voters can split half and half into opposites, e.g., half the voters are $D>R>T$ and half are $T>R>D$. Then cancellation gives the trivial election. If the number of voters is greater than one and odd (of the form $2k+1$ with $k>0$) then using the cycle diagram from the proof, $ Voting graphic: 27 + Voting graphic: 28 + Voting graphic: 29 = Voting graphic: 30  $          we can take $a=k$ and $b=k$ and $c=1$. Because $k>0$, this is a majority cycle.    Let $U$ be a subspace of $ ℝ^3$. Prove that the set $U^perp={vec{{v} such that $vec{vdot product of vec(u)=0$ for all $vec(u) in U$}}$ of vectors that are perpendicular to each vector in $U$ is also subspace of $ ℝ^3$. Does this hold if $U$ is not a subspace?  It is nonempty because it contains the zero vector. To see that it is closed under linear combinations of two of its members, suppose that $vec(v)_1$ and $vec(v)_2$ are in $U^perp$ and consider $c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2$. For any $vec(u) in U$, $ (c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2)dot product of vec(u) =c_1(vec(v)_1dot product of vec(u))+c_2(vec(v)_2dot product of vec(u)) =c_1· 0+c_2· 0=0 $ and so $c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2 in U^perp$.  As to whether it holds if $U$ is a subset but not a subspace, the answer is yes.              ``You can't add apples and oranges,'' the old saying goes. It reflects our experience that in applications the quantities have units and keeping track of those units can help. Everyone has done calculations such as this one that use the units as a check. $ 60(sec/min) · 60(min/hr) · 24(hr/day) · 365(day/year) = 31536000(sec/year) $ We can take the idea of including the units beyond bookkeeping. We can use units to draw conclusions about what relationships are possible among the physical quantities.  To start, consider the falling body equation~$distance=16·(time)^2$. If the distance is in feet and the time is in seconds then this is a true statement. However it is not correct in other unit systems, such as meters and seconds, because~$16$ isn't the right constant in those systems. We can fix that by attaching units to the $16$, making it a dimensional constant . $ dist=16(ft/sec^2)· (time)^2 $ Now the equation holds also in the meter-second system because when we align the units (a foot is approximately $0.30$ meters), $ distance in meters=16(0.30m/sec^2) · (time in sec)^2 =4.8(m/sec^2) · (time in sec)^2 $ the constant gets adjusted. So in order to have equations that are correct across unit systems, we restrict our attention to those that use dimensional constants. Such an equation is complete.  Moving away from a particular unit system allows us to just measure quantities in combinations of some units of length~$L$, mass~$M$, and time~$T$. These three are our physical dimensions . For instance, we could measure velocity in $feet/second$ or $fathoms/hour$ but at all events it involves a unit of length divided by a unit of time so the dimensional formula of velocity is $L/T$. Similarly, density's dimensional formula is $M/L^3$.  To write the dimensional formula we shall use negative exponents instead of fractions and we shall include the dimensions with a zero exponent. Thus we will write the dimensional formula of velocity as $L^1M^0T^{-1}$ and that of density as $L^{-3}M^1T^0$.  With that, ``you can't add apples and oranges'' becomes the advice to check that all of an equation's terms have the same dimensional formula. An example is this version of the falling body equation~$d-gt^2=0$. The dimensional formula of the $d$ term is $L^1M^0T^0$. For the other term, the dimensional formula of $g$ is $L^1M^0T^{-2}$ ($g$ is given above as $16ft/sec^2$) and the dimensional formula of $t$ is $L^0M^0T^1$ so that of the entire $gt^2$ term is $L^1M^0T^{-2}(L^0M^0T^1)^2=L^1M^0T^0$. Thus the two terms have the same dimensional formula. An equation with this property is dimensionally homogeneous.  Quantities with dimensional formula $L^0M^0T^0$ are dimensionless. For example, we measure an angle by taking the ratio of the subtended arc to the radius    which is the ratio of a length to a length $(L^1M^0T^0)(L^1M^0T^0)^{-1}$ and thus angles have the dimensional formula $L^0M^0T^0$.    The classic example of using the units for more than bookkeeping, using them to draw conclusions, considers the formula for the period of a pendulum. $ p=--some expression involving the length of the string, etc.-- $ The period is in units of time $L^0M^0T^1$. So the quantities on the other side of the equation must have dimensional formulas that combine in such a way that their $L$'s and $M$'s cancel and only a single $T$ remains. The table on page~pageref(table:Dimen) has the quantities that an experienced investigator would consider possibly relevant to the period of a pendulum. The only dimensional formulas involving $L$ are for the length of the string and the acceleration due to gravity. For the $L$'s of these two to cancel when they appear in the equation they must be in ratio, e.g., as $(l/g)^2$, or as $cos(l/g)$, or as $(l/g)^{-1}$. Therefore the period is a function of $l/g$.  This is a remarkable result:~with a pencil and paper analysis, before we ever took out the pendulum and made measurements, we have determined something about what makes up its period.  To do dimensional analysis systematically, we need two facts (arguments for these are in , Chapter~II and~IV). The first is that each equation relating physical quantities that we shall see involves a sum of terms, where each term has the form $ m_1^{p_1}m_2^{p_2}·s m_k^{p_k} $ for numbers $m_1$, ..., $m_k$ that measure the quantities.  For the second fact, observe that an easy way to construct a dimensionally homogeneous expression is by taking a product of dimensionless quantities or by adding such dimensionless terms. Buckingham's Theorem states that any complete relationship among quantities with dimensional formulas can be algebraically manipulated into a form where there is some function $f$ such that $ f(Pi(_1),...,Pi(_n))=0 $ for a complete set ${Pi(_1),...,Pi(_n)}$ of dimensionless products. (The first example below describes what makes a set of dimensionless products `complete'.) We usually want to express one of the quantities, $m_1$ for instance, in terms of the others. For that we will assume that the above equality can be rewritten $ m_1=m_2^{-p_2}·s m_k^{-p_k}· f̂(Pi(_2),...,Pi(_n)) $ where $Pi(_1)=m_1m_2^{p_2}·s m_k^{p_k}$ is dimensionless and the products $Pi(_2)$, ..., $Pi(_n)$ don't involve $m_1$ (as with $f$, here $f̂$ is an arbitrary function, this time of $n-1$ arguments). Thus, to do dimensional analysis we should find which dimensionless products are possible.   For example, again consider the formula for a pendulum's period.        {quantity} {[b] dimensional [-.3ex] formula } period $p$L^0M^0T^1$ length of string $l$L^1M^0T^0$ mass of bob $m$L^0M^1T^0$ acceleration due to gravity $g$L^1M^0T^{-2}$ arc of swing $θ$L^0M^0T^0$   By the first fact cited above, we expect the formula to have (possibly sums of terms of) the form $p^{p_1}l^{p_2}m^{p_3}g^{p_4}θ^{p_5}$. To use the second fact, to find which combinations of the powers~$p_1$, ..., $p_5$ yield dimensionless products, consider this equation. $ (L^0M^0T^1)^{p_1}(L^1M^0T^0)^{p_2}(L^0M^1T^0)^{p_3} (L^1M^0T^{-2})^{p_4}(L^0M^0T^0)^{p_5} =L^0M^0T^0 $ It gives three conditions on the powers. $ $ p_2 + p_4 = 0 p_3 = 0 p_1 - 2p_4 = 0 $ $ Note that $p_3=0$ so the mass of the bob does not affect the period. Gaussian reduction and parametrization of that system gives this $ {[p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 p_5]= [1 -1/2 0 1/2 0]p_1+ [0 0 0 0 1]p_5 such that p_1,p_5 in ℝ} $ (we've taken $p_1$ as one of the parameters in order to express the period in terms of the other quantities).  The set of dimensionless products contains all terms $p^{p_1}l^{p_2}m^{p_3}a^{p_4}θ^{p_5}$ subject to the conditions above. This set forms a vector space under the `$+$' operation of multiplying two such products and the `$·$' operation of raising such a product to the power of the scalar (see ). The term `complete set of dimensionless products' in Buckingham's Theorem means a basis for this vector space.  We can get a basis by first taking $p_1=1$, $p_5=0$, and then taking $p_1=0$, $p_5=1$. The associated dimensionless products are $Pi(_1)=pl^{-1/2}g^{1/2}$ and $Pi(_2)=θ$. Because the set ${Pi(_1),Pi(_2)}$ is complete, Buckingham's Theorem says that $ p = l^{1/2}g^{-1/2}·f̂(θ) = √{l/g}·f̂(θ) $ where $f̂$ is a function that we cannot determine from this analysis (a first year physics text will show by other means that for small angles it is approximately the constant function $f̂(θ)=2π$).  Thus, analysis of the relationships that are possible between the quantities with the given dimensional formulas has given us a fair amount of information:~a pendulum's period does not depend on the mass of the bob, and it rises with the square root of the length of the string.  For the next example we try to determine the period of revolution of two bodies in space orbiting each other under mutual gravitational attraction. An experienced investigator could expect that these are the relevant quantities.       {quantity} {[b] dimensional [-.3ex] formula } period $p$L^0M^0T^1$ mean separation $r$L^1M^0T^0$ first mass $m_1$L^0M^1T^0$ second mass $m_2$L^0M^1T^0$ gravitational constant $G$L^3M^{-1}T^{-2}$    To get the complete set of dimensionless products we consider the equation $ (L^0M^0T^1)^{p_1}(L^1M^0T^0)^{p_2}(L^0M^1T^0)^{p_3}(L^0M^1T^0)^{p_4} (L^3M^{-1}T^{-2})^{p_5}=L^0M^0T^0 $ which results in a system $ $ p_2 + 3p_5 = 0 p_3 + p_4 - p_5 = 0 p_1 - 2p_5 = 0 $ $ with this solution. $ {[1 -3/2 1/2 0 1/2]p_1 +[0 0 -1 1 0]p_4 such that p_1,p_4 in ℝ} $  As earlier, the set of dimensionless products of these quantities forms a vector space and we want to produce a basis for that space, a `complete' set of dimensionless products. One such set, gotten from setting $p_1=1$ and $p_4=0$ and also setting $p_1=0$ and $p_4=1$ is ${Pi(_1)=pr^{{-3/2}m_1^{{1/2}G^{{1/2},Pi(_2)=m_1^{{-1}m_2}$. With that, Buckingham's Theorem says that any complete relationship among these quantities is stateable this form. $ p = r^{3/2}m_1^{-1/2}G^{-1/2}·f̂(m_1^{-1}m_2) = frac{r^{3/2}}{√{Gm_1}}·f̂(m_2/m_1) $  Remark. An important application of the prior formula is when $m_1$ is the mass of the sun and $m_2$ is the mass of a planet. Because $m_1$ is very much greater than $m_2$, the argument to $f̂$ is approximately $0$, and we can wonder whether this part of the formula remains approximately constant as $m_2$ varies. One way to see that it does is this. The sun is so much larger than the planet that the mutual rotation is approximately about the sun's center. If we vary the planet's mass $m_2$ by a factor of $x$ (e.g., Venus's mass is $x=0.815$ times Earth's mass), then the force of attraction is multiplied by $x$, and $x$ times the force acting on $x$ times the mass gives, since $F=ma$, the same acceleration, about the same center (approximately). Hence, the orbit will be the same and so its period will be the same, and thus the right side of the above equation also remains unchanged (approximately). Therefore, $f̂(m_2/m_1)$ is approximately constant as $m_2$ varies. This is Kepler's Third Law:~the square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the mean radius of its orbit about the sun.  The final example was one of the first explicit applications of dimensional analysis. Lord Raleigh considered the speed of a wave in deep water and suggested these as the relevant quantities.   {quantity} {[b] dimensional [-.3ex] formula } velocity of the wave $v$L^1M^0T^{-1}$ density of the water $d$L^{-3}M^1T^0$ acceleration due to gravity $g$L^1M^0T^{-2}$ wavelength $λ$L^1M^0T^0$   The equation $ (L^1M^0T^{-1})^{p_1}(L^{-3}M^1T^0)^{p_2} (L^1M^0T^{-2})^{p_3}(L^1M^0T^0)^{p_4}=L^0M^0T^0 $ gives this system $ $ p_1 - 3p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 0 p_2 = 0 -p_1 - 2p_3 = 0 $ $ with this solution space. $ {[1 0 -1/2 -1/2]p_1 such that p_1 in ℝ} $ There is one dimensionless product, $Pi(_1)=vg^{-1/2}λ^{-1/2}$, and so $v$ is $√{λ g}$ times a constant; $f̂$ is constant since it is a function of no arguments. The quantity $d$ is not involved in the relationship.  The three examples above show that dimensional analysis can bring us far toward expressing the relationship among the quantities. For further reading, the classic reference is - this brief book is delightful. Another source is . A description of dimensional analysis's place in modeling is in .     Consider a projectile, launched with initial velocity $v_0$, at an angle $θ$. To study its motion we may guess that these are the relevant quantities.   {quantity} {[b] dimensional [-.3ex] formula } horizontal position $x$L^1M^0T^0$ vertical position $y$L^1M^0T^0$ initial speed $v_0$L^1M^0T^{-1}$ angle of launch $θ$L^0M^0T^0$ acceleration due to gravity $g$L^1M^0T^{-2}$ time $t$L^0M^0T^1$    Show that ${gt/v_0,gx/v_0^2,gy/v_0^2,θ}$ is a complete set of dimensionless products. (Hint. One way to go is to find the appropriate free variables in the linear system that arises but there is a shortcut that uses the properties of a basis.) These two equations of motion for projectiles are familiar: $x=v_0cos(θ) t$ and $y=v_0sin(θ) t- (g/2)t^2$. Manipulate each to rewrite it as a relationship among the dimensionless products of the prior item.    Assuming that this $ (L^1M^0T^0)^{p_1}(L^1M^0T^0)^{p_2}(L^1M^0T^{-1})^{p_3} (L^0M^0T^0)^{p_4}(L^1M^0T^{-2})^{p_5}(L^0M^0T^1)^{p_6} $ equals $L^0M^0T^0$ gives rise to this linear system $ $ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_5 = 0  -p_3 - 2p_5 + p_6 = 0 $ $ (there is no restriction on $p_4$). The natural parametrization uses the free variables to give $p_3=-2p_5+p_6$ and $p_1=-p_2+p_5-p_6$. The resulting description of the solution set $ {[p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 p_5 p_6] =p_2[-1 1 0 0 0 0] +p_4[0 0 0 1 0 0] +p_5[1 0 -2 0 1 0] +p_6[-1 0 1 0 0 1] such that p_2, p_4, p_5, p_6 in ℝ } $ gives ${y/x,θ,xt/{{v_0}^2,v_0t/x}$ as a complete set of dimensionless products (recall that ``complete'' in this context does not mean that there are no other dimensionless products; it simply means that the set is a basis). This is, however, not the set of dimensionless products that the question asks for.  There are two ways to proceed. The first is to fiddle with the choice of parameters, hoping to hit on the right set. For that, we can do the prior paragraph in reverse. Converting the given dimensionless products $gt/v_0$, $gx/v_0^2$, $gy/v_0^2$, and $θ$ into vectors gives this description (note the ?'s where the parameters will go). $ {[p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 p_5 p_6] =underline( ? ) [0 0 -1 0 1 1] +underline( ? ) [1 0 -2 0 1 0] +underline( ? ) [0 1 -2 0 1 0] +p_4[0 0 0 1 0 0] such that p_2, p_4, p_5, p_6 in ℝ } $ The $p_4$ is already in place. Examining the rows shows that we can also put in place $p_6$, $p_1$, and $p_2$.  The second way to proceed, following the hint, is to note that the given set is of size four in a four-dimensional vector space and so we need only show that it is linearly independent. That is easily done by inspection, by considering the sixth, first, second, and fourth components of the vectors. The first equation can be rewritten $ frac(gx){{v_0}^2}=(gt/v_0)cos(θ) $ so that Buckingham's function is $f_1(Pi(_1),Pi(_2),Pi(_3),Pi(_4))=Pi(_2-)Pi(_1)cos(Pi(_4))$. The second equation can be rewritten $ frac(gy){{v_0}^2}=(gt/v_0)sin(θ) -(1/2)((gt/v_0))^2 $ and Buckingham's function here is $f_2(Pi(_1),Pi(_2),Pi(_3),Pi(_4)) =Pi(_3-)Pi(_1)sin(Pi(_4))+(1/2){Pi(_1)}^2$.    conjectured that the infrared characteristic frequencies of a solid might be determined by the same forces between atoms as determine the solid's ordinary elastic behavior. The relevant quantities are these.   {quantity} {[b] dimensional [-.3ex] formula } characteristic frequency $ν$L^0M^0T^{-1}$ compressibility $k$L^1M^{-1}T^2$ number of atoms per cubic cm $N$L^{-3}M^0T^0$ mass of an atom $m$L^0M^1T^0$   Show that there is one dimensionless product. Conclude that, in any complete relationship among quantities with these dimensional formulas, $k$ is a constant times $ν^{-2}N^{-1/3}m^{-1}$. This conclusion played an important role in the early study of quantum phenomena.  Consider $ (L^0M^0T^{-1})^{p_1}(L^1M^{-1}T^2)^{p_2} (L^{-3}M^0T^0)^{p_3}(L^0M^1T^0)^{p_4}=(L^0M^0T^0) $ which gives these relations among the powers. $ $ p_2 - 3p_3 = 0 -p_2 + p_4 = 0 -p_1 + 2p_2 = 0 $ for step $ρ_1↔ρ_3$ repeat step $ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ -p_1 + 2p_2 = 0 -p_2 + p_4 = 0 -3p_3 + p_4 = 0 $ $ This is the solution space (because we wish to express $k$ as a function of the other quantities, we take $p_2$ as the parameter). $ {[2 1 1/3 1]p_2 such that p_2 in ℝ} $ Thus, $Pi(_1)=ν^2kN^{1/3}m$ is the dimensionless combination, and we have that $k$ equals $ν^{-2}N^{-1/3}m^{-1}$ times a constant (the function $f̂$ is constant since it has no arguments).    The torque produced by an engine has dimensional formula $L^2M^1T^{-2}$. We may first guess that it depends on the engine's rotation rate (with dimensional formula $L^0M^0T^{-1}$), and the volume of air displaced (with dimensional formula $L^3M^0T^0$).  Try to find a complete set of dimensionless products. What goes wrong? Adjust the guess by adding the density of the air (with dimensional formula $L^{-3}M^1T^0$). Now find a complete set of dimensionless products.    Setting $ (L^2M^1T^{-2})^{p_1}(L^0M^0T^{-1})^{p_2}(L^{3}M^0T^0)^{p_3} =(L^0M^0T^0) $ gives this $ $ 2p_1 + 3p_3 = 0 p_1 = 0 -2p_1 - p_2 = 0 $ $ which implies that $p_1=p_2=p_3=0$. That is, among quantities with these dimensional formulas, the only dimensionless product is the trivial one. Setting $ (L^2M^1T^{-2})^{p_1}(L^0M^0T^{-1})^{p_2}(L^{3}M^0T^0)^{p_3} (L^{-3}M^1T^0)^{p_4}=(L^0M^0T^0) $ gives this. $ $ 2p_1 + 3p_3 - 3p_4 = 0 p_1 + p_4 = 0 -2p_1 - p_2 = 0 $ for step $(-1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ repeat step $ρ_2↔ρ_3$ $ 2p_1 + 3p_3 - 3p_4 = 0 -p_2 + 3p_3 - 3p_4 = 0 (-3/2)p_3 + (5/2)p_4 = 0 $ $ Taking $p_1$ as parameter to express the torque gives this description of the solution set. $ {[1 -2 -5/3 -1]p_1 such that p_1 in ℝ} $ Denoting the torque by $τ$, the rotation rate by $r$, the volume of air by $V$, and the density of air by $d$ we have that $Pi(_1)=τ r^{-2} V^{-5/3} d^{-1}$, and so the torque is $r^2V^{5/3}d$ times a constant.     Dominoes falling make a wave. We may conjecture that the wave speed $v$ depends on the spacing $d$ between the dominoes, the height $h$ of each domino, and the acceleration due to gravity $g$.  Find the dimensional formula for each of the four quantities. Show that ${Pi(_1)=h/d,Pi(_2)=dg/v^2}$ is a complete set of dimensionless products. Show that if $h/d$ is fixed then the propagation speed is proportional to the square root of $d$.    These are the dimensional formulas.   {quantity} {[b] dimensional [-.3ex] formula } speed of the wave $v$L^1M^0T^{-1}$ separation of the dominoes $d$L^1M^0T^0$ height of the dominoes $h$L^1M^0T^0$ acceleration due to gravity $g$L^1M^0T^{-2}$   The relationship $ (L^1M^0T^{-1})^{p_1}(L^1M^0T^0)^{p_2}(L^1M^0T^0)^{p_3} (L^1M^0T^{-2})^{p_4}=(L^0M^0T^0) $ gives this linear system. $ $ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 0 0 = 0 -p_1 - 2p_4 = 0 $ for step $ρ_1+ρ_4$ $ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 0 p_2 + p_3 - p_4 = 0 $ $ Taking $p_3$ and $p_4$ as parameters, we can describe the solution set in this way. $ {[0 -1 1 0]p_3 +[-2 1 0 1]p_4 such that p_3,p_4 in ℝ} $ That gives ${Pi(_1)=h/d,Pi(_2)=dg/v^2}$ as a complete set. Buckingham's Theorem says that $v^2=dg·f̂(h/d)$ and so, since $g$ is a constant, if $h/d$ is fixed then $v$ is proportional to $√{d}$.    Prove that the dimensionless products form a vector space under the $vec(+)$ operation of multiplying two such products and the $vec(·)$ operation of raising such the product to the power of the scalar. (The vector arrows are a precaution against confusion.) That is, prove that, for any particular homogeneous system, this set of products of powers of $m_1$, ..., $m_k$ $ {m_1^{{p_1}... m_k^{{p_k} such that $p_1$, ..., $p_k$ satisfy the system} $ is a vector space under: $ m_1^{p_1}... m_k^{p_k} vec(+) m_1^{q_1}... m_k^{q_k} = m_1^{p_1+q_1}... m_k^{p_k+q_k} $ and $ rvec(·) (m_1^{p_1}... m_k^{p_k}) = m_1^{rp_1}... m_k^{rp_k} $ (assume that all variables represent real numbers).  Checking the conditions in the definition of a vector space is routine.                The advice about apples and oranges is not right. Consider the familiar equations for a circle $C=2π r$ and $A=π r^2$.  Check that $C$ and $A$ have different dimensional formulas. Produce an equation that is not dimensionally homogeneous (i.e., it adds apples and oranges) but is nonetheless true of any circle. The prior item asks for an equation that is complete but not dimensionally homogeneous. Produce an equation that is dimensionally homogeneous but not complete.  (Just because the old saying isn't strictly right doesn't keep it from being a useful strategy. Dimensional homogeneity is often used to check the plausibility of equations used in models. For an argument that any complete equation can easily be made dimensionally homogeneous, see , Chapter~I, especially page~15.)   The dimensional formula of the circumference is $L$, that is, $L^1M^0T^0$. The dimensional formula of the area is $L^2$. One is $C+A=2π r + π r^2$. One example is this formula relating the the length of arc subtended by an angle to the radius and the angle measure in radians:~$l-rθ=0$. Both terms in that formula have dimensional formula $L^1$. The relationship holds for some unit systems (inches and radians, for instance) but not for all unit systems (inches and degrees, for instance).             In the examples following the definition of a vector space we expressed the intuition that some spaces are ``the same'' as others. For instance, the space of two-tall column vectors and the space of two-wide row vectors are not equal because their elements- column vectors and row vectors- are not equal, but we feel that these spaces differ only in how their elements appear. We will now make this precise.  This section illustrates a common phase of a mathematical investigation. With the help of some examples we've gotten an idea. We will next give a formal definition and then we will produce some results backing our contention that the definition captures the idea. We've seen this happen already, for instance in the first section of the Vector Space chapter. There, the study of linear systems led us to consider collections closed under linear combinations. We defined such a collection as a vector space and we followed it with some supporting results.  That wasn't an end point, instead it led to new insights such as the idea of a basis. Here also, after producing a definition and supporting it, we will get two surprises (pleasant ones). First, we will find that the definition applies to some unforeseen, and interesting, cases. Second, the study of the definition will lead to new ideas. In this way, our investigation will build momentum.           subsection{Def{}inition and Examples} We start with two examples that suggest the right definition.  For example The space of two-wide row vectors and the space of two-tall column vectors are ``the same'' in that if we associate the vectors that have the same components, e.g., $ [1 2] longleftrightarrow[1 2] $ (read the double arrow as ``corresponds to'') then this association respects the operations. For instance these corresponding vectors add to corresponding totals $ [1 2]+[3 4]=[4 6] longleftrightarrow [1 2]+[3 4]=[4 6] $ and here is an example of the correspondence respecting scalar multiplication. $ 5·[1 2]=[5 10] longleftrightarrow 5·[1 2]=[5 10] $ Stated generally, under the correspondence $ [a_0 a_1] longleftrightarrow [a_0 a_1] $ both operations are preserved: $ [a_0 a_1]+[b_0 b_1]=[a_0+b_0 a_1+b_1] longleftrightarrow [a_0 a_1]+[b_0 b_1]=[a_0+b_0 a_1+b_1] $ and $ r·[a_0 a_1]=[ra_0 ra_1] longleftrightarrow r·[a_0 a_1]=[ra_0 ra_1] $ (all of the variables are scalars).   For example Another two spaces that we can think of as ``the same'' are $ polyspace(_2) $, the space of quadratic polynomials, and $ ℝ^3 $. A natural correspondence is this. $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 longleftrightarrow [a_0 a_1 a_2]  tag*{(e.g., $1+2x+3x^2longleftrightarrow[1 2 3]$)} $ This preserves structure:~corresponding elements add in a corresponding way $ {r $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 $ +$ b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2 $ $ (a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+(a_2+b_2)x^2 $ } longleftrightarrow [a_0 a_1 a_2] +[b_0 b_1 b_2] =[a_0+b_0 a_1+b_1 a_2+b_2] $ and scalar multiplication corresponds also. $ r·(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2)= (ra_0)+(ra_1)x+(ra_2)x^2 longleftrightarrow r·[a_0 a_1 a_2] =[ra_0 ra_1 ra_2] $     An isomorphism  between two vector spaces $V$ and $W$ is a map $ f: V → W $ that  is a correspondence: $ f $ is one-to-one and onto;  preserves structure: if $ vec(v)_1,vec(v)_2 in V $ then $ f(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)=f(vec(v)_1)+f(vec(v)_2) $ and if $ vec(v) in V $ and $ r in ℝ $ then $ f(rvec(v))=r{}f(vec(v)) $  (we write $ V≅ W $, read ``$ V $ is isomorphic to $ W $'', when such a map exists).     ``Morphism'' means map, so ``isomorphism'' means a map expressing sameness.  For example The vector space $ G={c_1cos(θ+c_2)sin(θ) such that c_1,c_2 in ℝ} $ of functions of $ θ $ is isomorphic to $ ℝ^2 $ under this map. $ c_1cos(θ+c_2)sin(θf) ↓[c_1 c_2] $ We will check this by going through the conditions in the definition. We will first verify condition~(1), that the map is a correspondence between the sets underlying the spaces.  To establish that $f$ is one-to-one we must prove that $ f(vec(a))=f(vec(b)) $ only when $ vec(a)=vec(b) $. If $ f(a_1cos(θ+a_2)sin(θ))=f(b_1cos(θ+b_2)sin(θ)) $ then by the definition of $f$ $ [a_1 a_2]=[b_1 b_2] $ from which we conclude that $ a_1=b_1 $ and $ a_2=b_2 $, because column vectors are equal only when they have equal components. Thus $a_1cos(θ+a_2)sin(θ)=b_1cos(θ+b_2)sin(θ)$, and as required we've verified that $ f(vec(a))=f(vec(b)) $ implies that $ vec(a)=vec(b) $.   To prove that $f$ is onto we must check that any member of the codomain $ ℝ^2 $ is the image of some member of the domain $G$. So, consider a member of the codomain $ [x y] $ and note that it is the image under $f$ of $ xcos(θ+y)sin(θ) $.  Next we will verify condition~(2), that $f$ preserves structure. This computation shows that $ f $ preserves addition. $ f[((a_1cos(θ+a_2)sin(θ)) +(b_1cos(θ+b_2)sin(θ))]) $ =f[((a_1+b_1)cos(θ+)(a_2+b_2)sin(θ)]) =[a_1+b_1 a_2+b_2] =[a_1 a_2]+[b_1 b_2] =f(a_1cos(θ+a_2)sin(θ))+f(b_1cos(θ+b_2)sin(θ)) $ $ The computation showing that $f$ preserves scalar multiplication is similar. $ f[(r·(a_1cos(θ+a_2)sin(θ))]) =f(ra_1cos(θ+ra_2)sin(θ)) =[ra_1 ra_2] =r·[a_1 a_2] =r· f(a_1cos(θ+a_2)sin(θ)) $  With both (1) and~(2) verified, we know that $f$ is an isomorphism and we can say that the spaces are isomorphic $G≅ ℝ^2$.   For example Let $ V $ be the space $ {c_1x+c_2y+c_3z such that c_1,c_2,c_3 in ℝ} $ of linear combinations of the three variables under the natural addition and scalar multiplication operations. Then $V$ is isomorphic to $polyspace(_2)$, the space of quadratic polynomials.  To show this we must produce an isomorphism map. There is more than one possibility; for instance, here are four to choose among.   $c_1x+c_2y+c_3z$   $f_1 ↓$c_1+c_2x+c_3x^2$ $f_2 ↓$c_2+c_3x+c_1x^2$ $f_3 ↓$-c_1-c_2x-c_3x^2$ $f_4 ↓$c_1+(c_1+c_2)x+(c_1+c_3)x^2$   The first map is the more natural correspondence in that it just carries the coefficients over. However we shall do $f_2$ to underline that there are isomorphisms other than the obvious one. (Checking that $f_1$ is an isomorphism is .)  To show that $f_2$ is one-to-one we will prove that if $f_2(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)=f_2(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)$ then $c_1x+c_2y+c_3z=d_1x+d_2y+d_3z$. The assumption that $f_2(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)=f_2(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)$ gives, by the definition of $f_2$, that $c_2+c_3x+c_1x^2=d_2+d_3x+d_1x^2$. Equal polynomials have equal coefficients so $c_2=d_2$, $c_3=d_3$, and $c_1=d_1$. Hence $f_2(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)=f_2(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)$ implies that $c_1x+c_2y+c_3z=d_1x+d_2y+d_3z$, and $f_2$ is one-to-one.  The map $f_2$ is onto because a member $a+bx+cx^2$ of the codomain is the image of a member of the domain, namely it is $f_2(cx+ay+bz)$. For instance, $2+3x-4x^2$ is $f_2(-4x+2y+3z)$.  The computations for structure preservation are like those in the prior example. The map $f_2$ preserves addition $ f_2[((c_1x+c_2y+c_3z) +(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)]) $ =f_2[((c_1+d_1)x+(c_2+d_2)y+(c_3+d_3)z]) =(c_2+d_2)+(c_3+d_3)x+(c_1+d_1)x^2 =(c_2+c_3x+c_1x^2)+(d_2+d_3x+d_1x^2) =f_2(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)+f_2(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z) $ $ and scalar multiplication. $ f_2[(r·(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)]) =f_2(rc_1x+rc_2y+rc_3z) =rc_2+rc_3x+rc_1x^2 =r·(c_2+c_3x+c_1x^2) =r· f_2(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z) $ Thus $f_2$ is an isomorphism. We write $V≅polyspace(_2)$.   For example Every space is isomorphic to itself under the identity map. The check is easy.     An automorphism is an isomorphism of a space with itself .    For example  A dilation map $d_s: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2$ that multiplies all vectors by a nonzero scalar $s$ is an automorphism of $ ℝ^2$.      Another automorphism is a rotation  or turning map , $map{t_{θ}}{ ℝ^2}{ ℝ^2}$ that rotates all vectors through an angle~$θ$.      A third type of automorphism of $ ℝ^2$ is a map $f_l: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2$ that flips or reflects  all vectors over a line $l$ through the origin.     Checking that these are automorphisms is .   For example Consider the space $polyspace(_5)$ of polynomials of degree~$5$ or less and the map $f$ that sends a polynomial $p(x)$ to $p(x-1)$. For instance, under this map $x^2↦ (x-1)^2=x^2-2x+1$ and $x^3+2x↦ (x-1)^3+2(x-1)=x^3-3x^2+5x-3$. This map is an automorphism of this space; the check is .  This isomorphism of $polyspace(_5)$ with itself does more than just tell us that the space is ``the same'' as itself. It gives us some insight into the space's structure. Below is a family of parabolas, graphs of members of $polyspace(_5)$. Each has a vertex at $y=-1$, and the left-most one has zeroes at $-2.25$ and $-1.75$, the next one has zeroes at $-1.25$ and $-0.75$, etc.    Substitution of $ x-1 $ for $ x $ in any function's argument shifts its graph to the right by one. Thus, $f(p_0)=p_1$, and $f$'s action is to shift all of the parabolas to the right by one. Notice that the picture before $f$ is applied is the same as the picture after $f$ is applied because while each parabola moves to the right, another one comes in from the left to take its place. This also holds true for cubics, etc. So the automorphism $f$ expresses the idea that $P_5$ has a certain horizontal-homogeneity: if we draw two pictures showing all members of $polyspace(_5)$, one picture centered at $x=0$ and the other centered at~$x=1$, then the two pictures would be indistinguishable.   As described in the opening to this section, having given the definition of isomorphism, we next look to support the thesis that it captures our intuition of vector spaces being the same. First, the definition itself is persuasive:~a vector space consists of a set and some structure and the definition simply requires that the sets correspond and that the structures correspond also. Also persuasive are the examples above, such as , which dramatize that isomorphic spaces are the same in all relevant respects. Sometimes people say, where $ V≅ W $, that ``$ W $ is just $ V $ painted green''- differences are merely cosmetic.  The results below further support our contention that under an isomorphism all the things of interest in the two vector spaces correspond. Because we introduced vector spaces to study linear combinations, ``of interest'' means ``pertaining to linear combinations.'' Not of interest is the way that the vectors are presented typographically (or their color!spacefactor(1000)).    An isomorphism maps a zero vector to a zero vector.      Where $ f: V → W $ is an isomorphism, fix some $ vec(v) in V $. Then $ f(0_V)=f(0·vec(v))=0· f(vec(v))=0_W $.          For any map $ f: V → W $ between vector spaces these statements are equivalent.  $ f $ preserves structure $ f(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)=f(vec(v)_1)+f(vec(v)_2) and f(cvec(v))=cf(vec(v)) $ $ f $ preserves linear combinations of two vectors $ f(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2)=c_1f(vec(v)_1)+c_2f(vec(v)_2) $ $ f $ preserves linear combinations of any finite number of vectors $ f(c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_nvec(v)_n)= c_1f(vec(v)_1)+...+c_nf(vec(v)_n) $       Since the implications $(3)⇒(2)$ and $(2)⇒(1)$ are clear, we need only show that $(1)⇒(3)$. So assume statement~(1). We will prove~(3) by induction on the number of summands $n$.    The one-summand base case, that $ f(cvec(v)_1)=cf(vec(v)_1) $, is covered by the second clause of statement~(1).    For the inductive step assume that statement~(3) holds whenever there are $ k $ or fewer summands.   Consider the $k+1$-summand case. Use the first half of~(1) to break the sum along the final `$+$'. $ f(c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_kvec(v)_k+c_{k+1}vec(v)_{k+1}) =f(c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_kvec(v)_k)+f(c_{k+1}vec(v)_{k+1}) $ Use the inductive hypothesis to break up the $k$-term sum on the left. $ =f(c_1vec(v)_1)+...+f(c_kvec(v)_k)+f(c_{k+1}vec(v)_{k+1}) $ Now the second half of~(1) gives $ =c_1f(vec(v)_1)+...+c_kf(vec(v)_k)+c_{k+1}f(vec(v)_{k+1}) $ when applied $k+1$~times.      We often use item~(2) to simplify the verification that a map preserves structure.  Finally, a summary. In the prior chapter, after giving the definition of a vector space, we looked at examples and noted that some spaces seemed to be essentially the same as others. Here we have defined the relation `$ cong$' and have argued that it is the right way to precisely say what we mean by ``the same'' because it preserves the features of interest in a vector space- in particular, it preserves linear combinations. In the next section we will show that isomorphism is an equivalence relation and so partitions the collection of vector spaces.     Verify, using nearbyexample(ex:CheckMapIsIso) as a model, that the two correspondences given before the definition are isomorphisms.       Call the map $f$. $ [a b] f ↓ [a b] $ It is one-to-one because if $f$ sends two members of the domain to the same image, that is, if $f([a b])=f([c d])$, then the definition of $f$ gives that $ [a b]=[c d] $ and since column vectors are equal only if they have equal components, we have that $a=c$ and that $b=d$. Thus, if $f$ maps two row vectors from the domain to the same column vector then the two row vectors are equal: $[a b]=[c d]$.  To show that $f$ is onto we must show that any member of the codomain $ ℝ^2$ is the image under $f$ of some row vector. That's easy; $ [x y] $ is $f([x y])$.  The computation for preservation of addition is this. $ f([a b]+[c d]) = f([a+c b+d]) = [a+c b+d] = [a b]+[c d] = f([a b])+f([c d]) $ The computation for preservation of scalar multiplication is similar. $ f(r·[a b]) = f([ra rb]) = [ra rb] = r·[a b] = r· f([a b]) $ Denote the map from by $f$. To show that it is one-to-one, assume that $ f(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2)=f(b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2) $. Then by the definition of the function, $ [a_0 a_1 a_2] =[b_0 b_1 b_2] $ and so $ a_0=b_0 $ and $ a_1=b_1 $ and $ a_2=b_2 $. Thus $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2=b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2 $, and consequently $ f $ is one-to-one.  The function $f$ is onto because there is a polynomial sent to $ [a b c] $ by $ f $, namely, $ a+bx+cx^2 $.  As for structure, this shows that $f$ preserves addition $ f((a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2)+(b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2)) $ =f((a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+(a_2+b_2)x^2) =[a_0+b_0 a_1+b_1 a_2+b_2] =[a_0 a_1 a_2] +[b_0 b_1 b_2] =f(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2)+f(b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2) $ $ and this shows $ f(r(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2)) =f((ra_0)+(ra_1)x+(ra_2)x^2) =[ra_0 ra_1 ra_2] =r·[a_0 a_1 a_2] =rf(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2) $ that it preserves scalar multiplication.    For the map $ f: polyspace(_1) → ℝ^2 $ given by $ a+bxf ↓[a-b b] $ Find the image of each of these elements of the domain.  $ 3-2x $ $ 2+2x $ $ x $  Show that this map is an isomorphism.  These are the images.  $ [5 -2] $ $ [0 2] $ $ [-1 1] $   To prove that $f$ is one-to-one, assume that it maps two linear polynomials to the same image $f(a_1+b_1x)=f(a_2+b_2x)$. Then $ [a_1-b_1 b_1]=[a_2-b_2 b_2] $ and so, since column vectors are equal only when their components are equal, $b_1=b_2$ and $a_1=a_2$. That shows that the two linear polynomials are equal, and so $f$ is one-to-one.  To show that $f$ is onto, note that this member of the codomain $ [s t] $ is the image of this member of the domain $(s+t)+tx$.  To check that $f$ preserves structure, we can use item~(2) of . $ f(c_1· (a_1+b_1x)+c_2· (a_2+b_2x)) =f((c_1a_1+c_2a_2)+(c_1b_1+c_2b_2)x) =[(c_1a_1+c_2a_2)-(c_1b_1+c_2b_2) c_1b_1+c_2b_2] =c_1·[a_1-b_1 b_1]+c_2·[a_2-b_2 b_2] =c_1· f(a_1+b_1x)+c_2· f(a_2+b_2x) $   Show that the natural map $f_1$ from  is an isomorphism.  To verify it is one-to-one, assume that $f_1(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)=f_1(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)$. Then $c_1+c_2x+c_3x^2=d_1+d_2x+d_3x^2$ by the definition of $f_1$. Members of $polyspace(_2)$ are equal only when they have the same coefficients, so this implies that $c_1=d_1$ and $c_2=d_2$ and $c_3=d_3$. Therefore $f_1(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)=f_1(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)$ implies that $c_1x+c_2y+c_3z=d_1x+d_2y+d_3z$, and so $f_1$ is one-to-one.  To verify that it is onto, consider an arbitrary member of the codomain $a_1+a_2x+a_3x^2$ and observe that it is indeed the image of a member of the domain, namely, it is $f_1(a_1x+a_2y+a_3z)$. (For instance, $0+3x+6x^2=f_1(0x+3y+6z)$.)  The computation checking that $f_1$ preserves addition is this. $ f_1((c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)+(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z)) $ =f_1((c_1+d_1)x+(c_2+d_2)y+(c_3+d_3)z) =(c_1+d_1)+(c_2+d_2)x+(c_3+d_3)x^2 =(c_1+c_2x+c_3x^2)+(d_1+d_2x+d_3x^2) =f_1(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)+f_1(d_1x+d_2y+d_3z) $ $  The check that $f_1$ preserves scalar multiplication is this. $ f_1(r· (c_1x+c_2y+c_3z)) =f_1((rc_1)x+(rc_2)y+(rc_3)z) =(rc_1)+(rc_2)x+(rc_3)x^2 =r· (c_1+c_2x+c_3x^2) =r· f_1(c_1x+c_2y+c_3z) $  Show that the map $t: polyspace(_2) → polyspace(_2)$ given by $t(ax^2+bx+c)=bx^2-(a+c)x+a$ is an isomorphism.  To see that the map is one-to-one suppose that $t(vec(v)_1)=t(vec(v)_2)$, aiming to conclude that $vec(v)_1=vec(v)_2$. That is, $t(a_1x^2+b_1x+c_1)=t(a_2x^2+b_2x+c_2)$. Then $b_1x^2-(a_1+c_1)x+a_1=b_2x^2-(a_2+c_2)x+a_2$ and because quadratic polynomials are equal only if they have have the same quadratic terms, the same constant terms, and the same linear terms we conclude that $b_1=b_2$, that $a_1=a_2$, and from that, $c_1=c_2$. Therefore $a_1x^2+b_1x+c_1=a_2x^2+b_2x+c_2$ and the function is one-to-one.  To see that the map is onto, we suppose that we are given a member~$vec(w)$ of the codomain and we find a member~$vec(v)$ of the domain that maps to it. Let the member of the codomain be~$vec(w)=px^2+qx+r$. Observe that where $vec(v)=rx^2+px+(-q-r)$ then $t(vec(v))=vec(w)$. Thus~$t$ is onto.  To see that the map is a homomorphism we show that it respects linear combinations of two elements. By this will show that the map preserves the operations. $ t(r_1(a_1x^2+b_1x+c_1)+r_2(a_2x^2+b_2x+c_2))  =t((r_1a_1+r_2a_2)x^2+(r_1b_1+r_2b_2)x+(r_1c_1+r_2c_2)) =(r_1b_1+r_2b_2)x^2-((r_1a_1+r_2a_2)+(r_1c_1+r_2c_2))x+(r_1a_1+r_2a_2) =(r_1b_1)x^2-(r_1a_1+r_1c_1)x+r_1a_1 +(r_2b_2)x^2-(r_2a_2+r_2c_2)x+r_2a_2 =r_1t(a_1x^2+b_1x+c_1)+r_2t(a_2x^2+b_2x+c_2)  $  Verify that this map is an isomorphism: $map(h){ ℝ^4}{matspace(_){N by N}}$ given by $ [a b c d] ↦ ([ c a+d b d ]) $  We first verify that $h$ is one-to-one. To do this we will show that $h(vec(v)_1)=h(vec(v)_2)$ implies that $vec(v)_1=vec(v)_2$. So assume that $ h(vec(v)_1) = h([a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1]) = h([a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2]) =h(vec(v)_2) $ which gives $ ([ c_1 a_1+d_1 b_1 d_1 ]) = ([ c_2 a_2+d_2 b_2 d_2 ]) $ from which we conclude that $c_1=c_2$ (by the upper-left entries), $b_1=b_2$ (by the lower-left entries), $d_1=d_2$ (by the lower-right entries), and with this last we get $a_1=a_2$ (by the upper right). Therefore $vec(v)_1=vec(v)_2$.  Next we will show that the map is onto, that every member of the codomain $matspace(_){N by N}$ is the image of some four-tall member of the domain. So, given $ vec(w)= ([ m n p q ]) inmatspace(_){N by N} $ observe that it is the image of this domain vector. $ vec(v)= [n-q p m q] $  To finish we verify that the map preserves linear combinations. By this will show that the map preserves the operations. $ h(r_1·[a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1] + r_2·[a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2]) =h([r_1a_1+r_2a_2 r_1b_1+r_2b_2 r_1c_1+r_2c_2 r_1d_1+r_2d_2]) = ([ r_1c_1+r_2c_2 (r_1a_1+r_2a_2)+(r_1d_1+r_2d_2) r_1b_1+r_2b_2 r_1d_1+r_2d_2 ]) = r_1([ c_1 a_1+d_1 b_1 d_1 ]) + r_2([ c_2 a_2+d_2 b_2 d_2 ]) =r_1· h([a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1]) + r_2· h([a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2]) $   Decide whether each map is an isomorphism (if it is an isomorphism then prove it and if it isn't then state a condition that it fails to satisfy).  $ map(f){matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ} $ given by $ ([ a b c d ]) ↦ ad-bc $ $ map(f){matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ^4} $ given by $ ([ a b c d ]) ↦ [a+b+c+d a+b+c a+b a] $ $ map(f){matspace(_){N by N}}{polyspace(_3)} $ given by $ ([ a b c d ]) ↦ c+(d+c)x+(b+a)x^2+ax^3 $ $ map(f){matspace(_){N by N}}{polyspace(_3)} $ given by $ ([ a b c d ]) ↦ c+(d+c)x+(b+a+1)x^2+ax^3 $    No; this map is not one-to-one. In particular, the matrix of all zeroes is mapped to the same image as the matrix of all ones. Yes, this is an isomorphism.  It is one-to-one: $ if f(([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ])) =f(([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ])) then [a_1+b_1+c_1+d_1 a_1+b_1+c_1 a_1+b_1 a_1] =[a_2+b_2+c_2+d_2 a_2+b_2+c_2 a_2+b_2 a_2] $ gives that $ a_1=a_2 $, and that $ b_1=b_2 $, and that $ c_1=c_2 $, and that $ d_1=d_2 $.  It is onto, since this shows $ [x y z w] =f(([ w z-w y-z x-y ])) $ that any four-tall vector is the image of a $N by N$~matrix.  Finally, it preserves combinations $ f(r_1·([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ]) +r_2·([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ])) $ =f(([ r_1a_1+r_2a_2 r_1b_1+r_2b_2 r_1c_1+r_2c_2 r_1d_1+r_2d_2 ])) =colvec{r_1a_1+...+r_2d_2 r_1a_1+...+r_2c_2 r_1a_1+...+r_2b_2 r_1a_1+r_2a_2} =r_1·colvec{a_1+...+d_1 a_1+...+c_1 a_1+b_1 a_1} +r_2·colvec{a_2+...+d_2 a_2+...+c_2 a_2+b_2 a_2} =r_1· f(([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ])) +r_2· f(([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ])) $ $ and so item~(2) of shows that it preserves structure. Yes, it is an isomorphism.  To show that it is one-to-one, we suppose that two members of the domain have the same image under $f$. $ f(([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ])) =f(([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ])) $ This gives, by the definition of $f$, that $c_1+(d_1+c_1)x+(b_1+a_1)x^2+a_1x^3 =c_2+(d_2+c_2)x+(b_2+a_2)x^2+a_2x^3$ and then the fact that polynomials are equal only when their coefficients are equal gives a set of linear equations $ c_1 = c_2 d_1+c_1 = d_2+c_2 b_1+a_1 = b_2+a_2 a_1 = a_2 $ that has only the solution $a_1=a_2$, $b_1=b_2$, $c_1=c_2$, and $d_1=d_2$.  To show that $f$ is onto, we note that $p+qx+rx^2+sx^3$ is the image under $f$ of this matrix. $ ([ s r-s p q-p ]) $  We can check that $f$ preserves structure by using item~(2) of . $ f(r_1·([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ]) +r_2·([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ])) $ = f(([ r_1a_1+r_2a_2 r_1b_1+r_2b_2 r_1c_1+r_2c_2 r_1d_1+r_2d_2 ])) =$[t] (r_1c_1+r_2c_2) +(r_1d_1+r_2d_2+r_1c_1+r_2c_2)x +(r_1b_1+r_2b_2+r_1a_1+r_2a_2)x^2 +(r_1a_1+r_2a_2)x^3 $ =$[t] r_1·(c_1+(d_1+c_1)x+(b_1+a_1)x^2+a_1x^3) +r_2·(c_2+(d_2+c_2)x +(b_2+a_2)x^2+a_2x^3) $ =r_1· f(([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ])) +r_2· f(([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ])) $ $ No, this map does not preserve structure. For instance, it does not send the matrix of all zeroes to the zero polynomial.    Show that the map $ f: ℝ^1 → ℝ^1 $ given by $ f(x)=x^3 $ is one-to-one and onto. Is it an isomorphism?  It is one-to-one and onto, a correspondence, because it has an inverse (namely, $ f^{-1}(x)=√[3]{x} $). However, it is not an isomorphism. For instance, $ f(1)+f(1) ≠ f(1+1) $.   Refer to . Produce two more isomorphisms (of course, you must also verify that they satisfy the conditions in the definition of isomorphism).  Many maps are possible. Here are two. $ [a b]↦[b a] and [a b]↦[2a b] $ The verifications are straightforward adaptations of the others above.   Refer to . Produce two more isomorphisms (and verify that they satisfy the conditions).  Here are two. $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 ↦ [a_1 a_0 a_2] and a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 ↦ [a_0+a_1 a_1 a_2] $ Verification is straightforward (for the second, to show that it is onto, note that $ [s t u] $ is the image of $(s-t)+tx+ux^2$).   Show that, although $ ℝ^2 $ is not itself a subspace of $ ℝ^3 $, it is isomorphic to the $ xy $-plane subspace of $ ℝ^3 $.  The space $ ℝ^2$ is not a subspace of $ ℝ^3$ because it is not a subset of $ ℝ^3$. The two-tall vectors in $ ℝ^2$ are not members of $ ℝ^3$.  The natural isomorphism $ ι: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3 $ (called the injection map) is this. $ [x y] ι ↓ [x y 0] $  This map is one-to-one because $ f([x_1 y_1])=f([x_2 y_2]) implies [x_1 y_1 0]=[x_2 y_2 0] $ which in turn implies that $x_1=x_2$ and $y_1=y_2$, and therefore the initial two two-tall vectors are equal.  Because $ [x y 0] =f([x y]) $ this map is onto the $xy$-plane.  To show that this map preserves structure, we will use item~(2) of and show $ f(c_1· [x_1 y_1]+c_2· [x_2 y_2]) = f([c_1x_1+c_2x_2 c_1y_1+c_2y_2]) =[c_1x_1+c_2x_2 c_1y_1+c_2y_2 0] =c_1· [x_1 y_1 0]+c_2· [x_2 y_2 0] =c_1· f([x_1 y_1])+c_2· f([x_2 y_2]) $ that it preserves combinations of two vectors.   Find two isomorphisms between $ ℝ^{16} $ and $ matspace(_){N by N} $.  Here are two: $ [r_1 r_2 ... r_{16]} ↦ ([ r_1 r_2 ...  ... r_{16} ]) and [r_1 r_2 ... r_{16]} ↦ ([ r_1 r_2 ... ... r_{16} ]) $ Verification that each is an isomorphism is easy.   For what $ k $ is $ matspace(_){N by M} $ isomorphic to $ ℝ^{k} $?  When $k$ is the product $ k=mn $, here is an isomorphism. $ ([ r_1 r_2 ... ... ... r_{m· n} ]) ↦ [r_1 r_2 ... r_{m· n]} $ Checking that this is an isomorphism is easy.   For what $ k $ is $ polyspace(_k) $ isomorphic to $ ℝ^n $?  If $ n≥ 1 $ then $ polyspace(_){n-1}≅ ℝ^n $. (If we take $ polyspace(_){-1} $ and $ ℝ^0 $ to be trivial vector spaces, then the relationship extends one dimension lower.) The natural isomorphism between them is this. $ a_0+a_1x+...+a_{n-1}x^{n-1} ↦[a_0 a_1 ... a_{n-1]} $ Checking that it is an isomorphism is straightforward.   Prove that the map in , from $ polyspace(_5) $ to $ polyspace(_5) $ given by $ p(x)↦ p(x-1) $, is a vector space isomorphism.  This is the map, expanded. $ f(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+a_4x^4+a_5x^5) $ =a_0+a_1(x-1)+a_2(x-1)^2+a_3(x-1)^3 +a_4(x-1)^4+a_5(x-1)^5 =a_0+a_1(x-1)+a_2(x^2-2x+1) +a_3(x^3-3x^2+3x-1) +a_4(x^4-4x^3+6x^2-4x+1) +a_5(x^5-5x^4+10x^3-10x^2+5x-1) =(a_0-a_1+a_2-a_3+a_4-a_5) +(a_1-2a_2+3a_3-4a_4+5a_5)x +(a_2-3a_3+6a_4-10a_5)x^2 +(a_3-4a_4+10a_5)x^3 +(a_4-5a_5)x^4 +a_5x^5 $ $ This map is a correspondence because it has an inverse, the map $ p(x)↦ p(x+1) $.  To finish checking that it is an isomorphism we apply item~(2) of and show that it preserves linear combinations of two polynomials. Briefly, $f(c· (a_0+a_1x+... +a_5x^5)+d· (b_0+b_1x+... +b_5x^5))$ equals this $ (ca_0-ca_1+ca_2-ca_3+ca_4-ca_5+db_0-db_1+db_2-db_3+db_4-db_5) +...+(ca_5+db_5)x^5 $ which equals $c· f(a_0+a_1x+... +a_5x^5)+d· f(b_0+b_1x+... +b_5x^5)$.   Why, in , must there be a $ vec(v) in V $? That is, why must $V$ be nonempty?  No vector space has the empty set underlying it. We can take $vec(v)$ to be the zero vector.   Are any two trivial spaces isomorphic?  Yes; where the two spaces are $ {vec{{a}} $ and $ {vec{{b}} $, the map sending $ vec(a) $ to $ vec(b) $ is clearly one-to-one and onto, and also preserves what little structure there is.   In the proof of , what about the zero-summands case (that is, if $n$ is zero)?  A linear combination of $n=0$ vectors adds to the zero vector and so  shows that the three statements are equivalent in this case.   Show that any isomorphism $ f: polyspace(_0) → ℝ^1 $ has the form $ a↦ ka $ for some nonzero real number $ k $.  Consider the basis $ 1 $ for $ polyspace(_0) $ and let $ f(1) in ℝ $ be $ k $. For any $ a inpolyspace(_0) $ we have that $ f(a)=f(a· 1)=af(1)=ak $ and so $ f $'s action is multiplication by $ k $. Note that $ k ≠ 0 $ or else the map is not one-to-one. (Incidentally, any such map $a↦ ka$ is an isomorphism, as is easy to check.)   These prove that isomorphism is an equivalence relation.  Show that the identity map $id: V → V$ is an isomorphism. Thus, any vector space is isomorphic to itself. Show that if $f: V → W$ is an isomorphism then so is its inverse $map{f^{-1}}{W}{V}$. Thus, if $V$ is isomorphic to $W$ then also $W$ is isomorphic to $V$. Show that a composition of isomorphisms is an isomorphism: if $f: V → W$ is an isomorphism and $g: W → U$ is an isomorphism then so also is $map{∘{g}{f}}{V}{U}$. Thus, if $V$ is isomorphic to $W$ and $W$ is isomorphic to $U$, then also $V$ is isomorphic to $U$.   In each item, following item~(2) of , we show that the map preserves structure by showing that the it preserves linear combinations of two members of the domain.   The identity map is clearly one-to-one and onto. For linear combinations the check is easy. $ id(c_1· vec(v)_1+c_2· vec(v)_2) =c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2 =c_1· id(vec(v)_1)+c_2· id(vec(v)_2) $ The inverse of a correspondence is also a correspondence (as stated in the appendix), so we need only check that the inverse preserves linear combinations. Assume that $ vec(w)_1=f(vec(v)_1) $ (so $ f^{-1}(vec(w)_1)=vec(v)_1 $) and assume that $ vec(w)_2=f(vec(v)_2) $. $ f^{-1}(c_1·vec(w)_1+c_2·vec(w)_2) =f^{-1}[(c_1· f(vec(v)_1) +c_2· f(vec(v)_2)]) =f^{-1}(f[(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2)]) =c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2 =c_1· f^{-1}(vec(w)_1)+c_2· f^{-1}(vec(w)_2) $ The composition of two correspondences is a correspondence (as stated in the appendix), so we need only check that the composition map preserves linear combinations. $ ∘{g}{f}[(c_1·vec(v)_1+c_2·vec(v)_2]) =g[(f(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2)]) =g[(c_1· f(vec(v)_1)+c_2· f(vec(v)_2)]) =c_1· g[(f(vec(v)_1))+c_2· g(f(vec(v)_2)]) =c_1·∘{g}{f}(vec(v)_1) +c_2·∘{g}{f}(vec(v)_2) $    Suppose that $ f: V → W $ preserves structure. Show that $ f $ is one-to-one if and only if the unique member of $ V $ mapped by $ f $ to $ 0_W $ is $ 0_V $.  One direction is easy:~by definition, if $ f $ is one-to-one then for any $ vec(w) in W $ at most one $ vec(v) in V $ has $ f(vec(v))=vec(w) $, and so in particular, at most one member of $ V $ is mapped to $ 0_W $. The proof of does not use the fact that the map is a correspondence and therefore shows that any structure-preserving map $ f $ sends $ 0_V $ to $ 0_W $.  For the other direction, assume that the only member of $ V $ that is mapped to $ 0_W $ is $ 0_V $. To show that $ f $ is one-to-one assume that $ f(vec(v)_1)=f(vec(v)_2) $. Then $ f(vec(v)_1)-f(vec(v)_2)=0_W $ and so $ f(vec(v)_1-vec(v)_2)=0_W $. Consequently $ vec(v)_1-vec(v)_2=0_V $, so $vec(v)_1=vec(v)_2$, and so $ f $ is one-to-one.   Suppose that $ f: V → W $ is an isomorphism. Prove that the set $ {vec{{v}_1,...,vec{{v}_k}⊆ V $ is linearly dependent if and only if the set of images $ {f(vec{{v}_1),...,f(vec{{v}_k)}⊆ W $ is linearly dependent.  We will prove something stronger- not only is the existence of a dependence preserved by isomorphism, but each instance of a dependence is preserved, that is, $ vec(v)_i=c_1vec(v)_1+·s+c_{i-1}vec(v)_{i-1} +c_{i+1}vec(v)_{i+1}+·s+c_kvec(v)_k ⇔ f(vec(v)_i)=c_1f(vec(v)_1)+·s+c_{i-1}f(vec(v)_{i-1}) +c_{i+1}f(vec(v)_{i+1})+·s+c_kf(vec(v)_k). $ The $ ⇒ $ direction of this statement holds by item~(3) of . The $ isimpliedby$ direction holds by regrouping $ f(vec(v)_i) =c_1f(vec(v)_1)+...+c_{i-1}f(vec(v)_{i-1}) +c_{i+1}f(vec(v)_{i+1})+...+c_kf(vec(v)_k) =f(c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_{i-1}vec(v)_{i-1} +c_{i+1}vec(v)_{i+1}+...+c_k vec(v)_k) $ and applying the fact that $f$ is one-to-one, and so for the two vectors $vec(v)_i$ and $c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_{i-1}vec(v)_{i-1} +c_{i+1}fvec(v)_{i+1}+...+c_kf(vec(v)_k$ to be mapped to the same image by $f$, they must be equal.   Show that each type of map from is an automorphism.  Dilation $d_s$ by a nonzero scalar $ s $. Rotation $t_θ$ through an angle $ θ $. Reflection $f_l$ over a line through the origin.  Hint. For the second and third items, polar coordinates are useful.    This map is one-to-one because if $ d_s(vec(v)_1)=d_s(vec(v)_2) $ then by definition of the map, $ s·vec(v)_1=s·vec(v)_2 $ and so $ vec(v)_1=vec(v)_2 $, as $ s $ is nonzero. This map is onto as any $ vec(w) in ℝ^2 $ is the image of $ vec(v)=(1/s)·vec(w) $ (again, note that $s$ is nonzero). (Another way to see that this map is a correspondence is to observe that it has an inverse: the inverse of $ d_s $ is $ d_{1/s} $.)  To finish, note that this map preserves linear combinations $ d_s(c_1·vec(v)_1+c_2·vec(v)_2) =s(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2) =c_1svec(v)_1+c_2svec(v)_2 =c_1· d_s(vec(v)_1)+c_2· d_s(vec(v)_2) $ and therefore is an isomorphism. As in the prior item, we can show that the map $t_θ$ is a correspondence by noting that it has an inverse, $t_{-θ}$.  That the map preserves structure is geometrically easy to see. For instance, adding two vectors and then rotating them has the same effect as rotating first and then adding. For an algebraic argument, consider polar coordinates: the map $ t_θ $ sends the vector with endpoint $ (r,φ) $ to the vector with endpoint $ (r,φ+θ) $. Then the familiar trigonometric formulas $cos(φ+θ)=cos(φ)cos(θ-)sin(φ)sin(θ)$ and $sin(φ+θ)=sin(φ)cos(θ+)cos(φ)sin(θ)$ show how to express the map's action in the usual rectangular coordinate system. $ [x y]=[r cosφ r sinφ] t_θ ↓ [r cos(φ+θ) r sin(φ+θ)] =[x cosθ-y sinθ x sinθ+y cosθ] $ Now the calculation for preservation of addition is routine. $ [x_1+x_2 y_1+y_2] t_θ ↓ colvec{(x_1+x_2)cos(θ-)(y_1+y_2)sin(θ) (x_1+x_2)sin(θ+)(y_1+y_2)cos(θ)} =colvec{x_1cos(θ-y_1)sin(θ) x_1sin(θ+y_1)cos(θ)} +colvec{x_2cos(θ-y_2)sin(θ) x_2sin(θ+y_2)cos(θ)} $ The calculation for preservation of scalar multiplication is similar.  This map is a correspondence because it has an inverse (namely, itself).  As in the last item, that the reflection map preserves structure is geometrically easy to see:~adding vectors and then reflecting gives the same result as reflecting first and then adding, for instance. For an algebraic proof, suppose that the line $l$ has slope $k$ (the case of a line with undefined slope can be done as a separate, but easy, case). We can follow the hint and use polar coordinates:~where the line $ l $ forms an angle of $ φ $ with the $ x $-axis, the action of $ f_l $ is to send the vector with endpoint $ (rcos(θ),rsin(θ)) $ to the one with endpoint $ (rcos(2φ-θ),rsin(2φ-θ)) $.    To convert to rectangular coordinates, we will use some trigonometric formulas, as we did in the prior item. First observe that $cos(φ)$ and $sin(φ)$ can be determined from the slope $k$ of the line. This picture    gives that $cos(φ)=1/√{1+k^2}$ and $sin(φ)=k/√{1+k^2}$. Now, $ cos(2φ-θ) =cos(2φ)cos(θ+)sin(2φ)sin(θ) =(cos^2(φ-)sin^2(φ))cos(θ) +(2sin(φ)cos(φ))sin(θ) =((frac(1){√{1+k^2}})^2 -(frac(k){√{1+k^2}})^2) cos(θ) +(2frac(k){√{1+k^2}}frac(1){√{1+k^2}}) sin(θ) =((1-k^2/1+k^2))cos(θ) +((2k/1+k^2))sin(θ) $ and thus the first component of the image vector is this. $ r·cos(2φ-θ)=(1-k^2/1+k^2)· x +(2k/1+k^2)· y $ A similar calculation shows that the second component of the image vector is this. $ r·sin(2φ-θ)=(2k/1+k^2)· x -(1-k^2/1+k^2)· y $ With this algebraic description of the action of $f_l$ $ [x y] f_l ↓ colvec{(1-k^2/1+k^2)· x +(2k/1+k^2)· y (2k/1+k^2)· x -(1-k^2/1+k^2)· y} $ checking that it preserves structure is routine.    Produce an automorphism of $ polyspace(_2) $ other than the identity map, and other than a shift map $p(x)↦ p(x-k)$.  First, the map $p(x)↦ p(x+k)$ doesn't count because it is a version of $p(x)↦ p(x-k)$. Here is a correct answer (many others are also correct): $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 ↦ a_2+a_0x+a_1x^2 $. Verification that this is an isomorphism is straightforward.    Show that a function $ f: ℝ^1 → ℝ^1 $ is an automorphism if and only if it has the form $ x↦ kx $ for some $ k ≠ 0 $. Let $ f $ be an automorphism of $ ℝ^1 $ such that $ f(3)=7 $. Find $ f(-2) $. Show that a function $ f: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ is an automorphism if and only if it has the form $ [x y] ↦ [ax+by cx+dy] $ for some $ a,b,c,d in ℝ $ with $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $. Hint. Exercises in prior subsections have shown that $ [b d] is not a multiple of [a c] $ if and only if $ad-bc ≠ 0$. Let $ f $ be an automorphism of $ ℝ^2 $ with $ f([1 3])=[2 -1] and f([1 4])=[0 1]. $ Find $ f([0 -1]). $    For the `only if' half, let $ f: ℝ^1 → ℝ^1 $ to be an isomorphism. Consider the basis $ 1⊆ ℝ^1 $. Designate $ f(1) $ by $ k $. Then for any $ x $ we have that $ f(x)=f(x· 1)=x· f(1)=xk $, and so $f$'s action is multiplication by $k$. To finish this half, just note that $ k ≠ 0 $ or else $f$ would not be one-to-one.  For the `if' half we only have to check that such a map is an isomorphism when $k ≠ 0$. To check that it is one-to-one, assume that $ f(x_1)=f(x_2) $ so that $ kx_1=kx_2 $ and divide by the nonzero factor $ k $ to conclude that $x_1=x_2$. To check that it is onto, note that any $ y in ℝ^1 $ is the image of $ x=y/k $ (again, $k ≠ 0$). Finally, to check that such a map preserves combinations of two members of the domain, we have this. $ f(c_1x_1+c_2x_2) =k(c_1x_1+c_2x_2) =c_1kx_1+c_2kx_2 =c_1f(x_1)+c_2f(x_2) $ By the prior item, $f$'s action is $ x↦ (7/3)x $. Thus $ f(-2)=-14/3 $. For the `only if' half, assume that $ f: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ is an automorphism. Consider the standard basis $ stdbasis(_2) $ for $ ℝ^2 $. Let $ f(vec(e)_1)=[a c] and f(vec(e)_2)=[b d]. $ Then the action of $f$ on any vector is determined by by its action on the two basis vectors. $ f([x y]) =f(x·vec(e)_1+y·vec(e)_2) =x· f(vec(e)_1)+y· f(vec(e)_2) =x·[a c]+y·[b d] =[ax+by cx+dy] $ To finish this half, note that if $ ad-bc=0 $, that is, if $ f(vec(e)_2) $ is a multiple of $ f(vec(e)_1) $, then $ f $ is not one-to-one.  For `if' we must check that the map is an isomorphism, under the condition that $ad-bc ≠ 0$. The structure-preservation check is easy; we will here show that $ f $ is a correspondence. For the argument that the map is one-to-one, assume this. $ f([x_1 y_1]) =f([x_2 y_2]) and so [ax_1+by_1 cx_1+dy_1] =[ax_2+by_2 cx_2+dy_2] $ Then, because $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $, the resulting system $ $ a(x_1-x_2) + b(y_1-y_2) = 0 c(x_1-x_2) + d(y_1-y_2) = 0 $ $ has a unique solution, namely the trivial one $x_1-x_2=0$ and $y_1-y_2=0$ (this follows from the hint).  The argument that this map is onto is closely related- this system $ $ ax_1 + by_1 = x cx_1 + dy_1 = y $ $ has a solution for any $ x $ and $ y $ if and only if this set $ {[a c], [b d] } $ spans $ ℝ^2 $, i.e., if and only if this set is a basis (because it is a two-element subset of $ ℝ^2$), i.e., if and only if $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $.  $ f([0 -1])=f([1 3]-[1 4]) =f([1 3])-f([1 4]) =[2 -1]-[0 1] =[2 -2] $    Refer to and . Find two more things preserved by isomorphism.  There are many answers; two are linear independence and subspaces.  First we show that if a set ${vec{{v}_1,...,vec{{v}_n}$ is linearly independent then its image ${f(vec{{v}_1),...,f(vec{{v}_n)}$ is also linearly independent. Consider a linear relationship among members of the image set. $ 0=c_1f(vec(v)_1)+...+c_nf(vec(v_n)) =f(c_1vec(v)_1)+...+f(c_nvec(v_n)) =f(c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_nvec(v_n)) $ Because this map is an isomorphism, it is one-to-one. So $f$ maps only one vector from the domain to the zero vector in the range, that is, $c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_nvec(v)_n$ equals the zero vector (in the domain, of course). But, if ${vec{{v}_1,...,vec{{v}_n}$ is linearly independent then all of the $c$'s are zero, and so ${f(vec{{v}_1),...,f(vec{{v}_n)}$ is linearly independent also. (Remark. There is a small point about this argument that is worth mention. In a set, repeats collapse, that is, strictly speaking, this is a one-element set: ${vec{{v},vec{{v}}$, because the things listed as in it are the same thing. Observe, however, the use of the subscript~$n$ in the above argument. In moving from the domain set ${vec{{v}_1,...,vec{{v}_n}$ to the image set ${f(vec{{v}_1),...,f(vec{{v}_n)}$, there is no collapsing, because the image set does not have repeats, because the isomorphism $f$ is one-to-one.)  To show that if $f: V → W$ is an isomorphism and if $U$ is a subspace of the domain $V$ then the set of image vectors $f(U)={vec{{w} in W such that $vec{w=f(vec(u))$ for some $vec(u) in U$}}$ is a subspace of $W$, we need only show that it is closed under linear combinations of two of its members (it is nonempty because it contains the image of the zero vector). We have $ c_1· f(vec(u)_1)+c_2· f(vec(u)_2) =f(c_1vec(u)_1)+f(c_2vec(u)_2) =f(c_1vec(u)_1+c_2vec(u)_2) $ and $c_1vec(u)_1+c_2vec(u)_2$ is a member of $U$ because of the closure of a subspace under combinations. Hence the combination of $f(vec(u)_1)$ and $f(vec(u)_2)$ is a member of $f(U)$.   We show that isomorphisms can be tailored to fit in that, sometimes, given vectors in the domain and in the range we can produce an isomorphism associating those vectors.  Let $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2, vec(β)_3} $ be a basis for $ polyspace(_2) $ so that any $ vec(p) inpolyspace(_2) $ has a unique representation as $ vec(p)=c_1vec(β)_1+c_2vec(β)_2+c_3vec(β)_3 $, which we denote in this way. $ rep{vec(p)}{B}=[c_1 c_2 c_3] $ Show that the $Representation of (·)$ operation is a function from $ polyspace(_2) $ to $ ℝ^3 $ (this entails showing that with every domain vector $ vec(v) inpolyspace(_2) $ there is an associated image vector in $ ℝ^3 $, and further, that with every domain vector $ vec(v) inpolyspace(_2) $ there is at most one associated image vector). Show that this $Representation of (·)$ function is one-to-one and onto. Show that it preserves structure. Produce an isomorphism from $ polyspace(_2) $ to $ ℝ^3 $ that fits these specifications. $ x+x^2↦[1 0 0] and 1-x↦[0 1 0] $    The association $ vec(p)=c_1vec(β)_1+c_2vec(β)_2+c_3vec(β)_3 Representation of (·) ↓ [c_1 c_2 c_3] $ is a function if every member $vec(p)$ of the domain is associated with at least one member of the codomain, and if every member $vec(p)$ of the domain is associated with at most one member of the codomain. The first condition holds because the basis $B$ spans the domain- every $vec(p)$ can be written as at least one linear combination of $vec(β)$'s. The second condition holds because the basis $B$ is linearly independent- every member $vec(p)$ of the domain can be written as at most one linear combination of the $vec(β)$'s. For the one-to-one argument, if $rep{vec(p)}{B}=rep{vec(q)}{B}$, that is, if $ rep{p_1vec(β)_1+p_2vec(β)_2+p_3vec(β)_3}{B} =rep{q_1vec(β)_1+q_2vec(β)_2+q_3vec(β)_3}{B} $ then $ [p_1 p_2 p_3] =[q_1 q_2 q_3] $ and so $ p_1=q_1 $ and $ p_2=q_2 $ and $ p_3=q_3 $, which gives the conclusion that $vec(p)=vec(q)$. Therefore this map is one-to-one.  For onto, we can just note that $ [a b c] $ equals $rep{avec(β)_1+bvec(β)_2+cvec(β)_3}{B}$, and so any member of the codomain $ ℝ^3$ is the image of some member of the domain $polyspace(_2)$. This map respects addition and scalar multiplication because it respects combinations of two members of the domain (that is, we are using item~(2) of ): where $vec(p)=p_1vec(β)_1+p_2vec(β)_2+p_3vec(β)_3$ and $vec(q)=q_1vec(β)_1+q_2vec(β)_2+q_3vec(β)_3$, we have this. $ rep{c·vec(p)+d·vec(q)}{B} =rep{(cp_1+dq_1)vec(β)_1+(cp_2+dq_2)vec(β)_2 +(cp_3+dq_3)vec(β)_3}{B} =[cp_1+dq_1 cp_2+dq_2 cp_3+dq_3] =c·[p_1 p_2 p_3] +d·[q_1 q_2 q_3] =rep{vec(p)}{B}+rep{vec(q)}{B} $ Use any basis $ B $ for $polyspace(_2)$ whose first two members are $ x+x^2 $ and $ 1-x $, say $ B=x+x^2,1-x,1 $.    Prove that a space is $ n $-dimensional if and only if it is isomorphic to $ ℝ^n $. Hint. Fix a basis $B$ for the space and consider the map sending a vector over to its representation with respect to $B$.  See the next subsection.   textit{(Requires the subsection on Combining Subspaces, which is optional.)} Let $ U $ and $ W $ be vector spaces. Define a new vector space, consisting of the set $ U× W={(vec{{u},vec{{w}) such that vec{{u} in U{ and vec(w) in W} $ along with these operations. $ (vec(u)_1,vec(w)_1)+(vec(u)_2,vec(w)_2)= (vec(u)_1+vec(u)_2,vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2) and r· (vec(u),vec(w))=(rvec(u),rvec(w)) $ This is a vector space, the external direct sum of $ U $ and $ W $.  Check that it is a vector space. Find a basis for, and the dimension of, the external direct sum $ polyspace(_2)× ℝ^2 $. What is the relationship among $ dim(U) $, $ dim(W) $, and $ dim(U× W) $? Suppose that $ U $ and $ W $ are subspaces of a vector space $ V $ such that $ V=U⊕ W $ (in this case we say that $V$ is the internal direct sum of $U$ and $W$). Show that the map $ f: U× W → V $ given by $ (vec(u),vec(w))f ↓ vec(u)+vec(w) $ is an isomorphism. Thus if the internal direct sum is defined then the internal and external direct sums are isomorphic.    Most of the conditions in the definition of a vector space are routine. We here sketch the verification of part~(1) of that definition.  For closure of $U× W$, note that because $ U $ and $ W $ are closed, we have that $vec(u)_1+vec(u)_2 in U$ and $vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2 in W$ and so $ (vec(u)_1+vec(u)_2,vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2) in U× W $. Commutativity of addition in $ U× W $ follows from commutativity of addition in $ U $ and $ W $. $ (vec(u)_1,vec(w)_1)+(vec(u)_2,vec(w)_2)= (vec(u)_1+vec(u)_2,vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2) =(vec(u)_2+vec(u)_1,vec(w)_2+vec(w)_1) =(vec(u)_2,vec(w)_2)+(vec(u)_1,vec(w)_1) $ The check for associativity of addition is similar. The zero element is $ (0_U,0_W) in U× W $ and the additive inverse of $ (vec(u),vec(w)) $ is $ (-vec(u),-vec(w)) $.  The checks for the second part of the definition of a vector space are also straightforward. This is a basis $ sequence{ (1,[0 0]), (x,[0 0]), (x^2,[0 0]), (1,[1 0]), (1,[0 1]) } $ because there is one and only one way to represent any member of $polyspace(_2)× ℝ^2$ with respect to this set; here is an example. $ (3+2x+x^2,[5 4]) = 3·(1,[0 0]) +2·(x,[0 0]) +(x^2,[0 0]) +5·(1,[1 0]) +4·(1,[0 1]) $ The dimension of this space is five. We have $ dim(U× W)=dim(U)+dim(W) $ as this is a basis. $ sequence{ (vec(μ)_1,0_W), ..., (vec(μ)_{dim(U)},0_W), (0_U,vec(ω)_1), ...,(0_U,vec(ω)_{dim(W)}) } $ We know that if $ V=U⊕ W $ then each $ vec(v) in V $ can be written as $ vec(v)=vec(u)+vec(w) $ in one and only one way. This is just what we need to prove that the given function an isomorphism.  First, to show that $ f $ is one-to-one we can show that if $ f((vec(u)_1,vec(w)_1)) =((vec(u)_2,vec(w)_2)) $, that is, if $ vec(u)_1+vec(w)_1=vec(u)_2+vec(w)_2 $ then $ vec(u)_1=vec(u)_2 $ and $ vec(w)_1=vec(w)_2 $. But the statement `each $vec(v)$ is such a sum in only one way' is exactly what is needed to make this conclusion. Similarly, the argument that $ f $ is onto is completed by the statement that `each $vec(v)$ is such a sum in at least one way'.  This map also preserves linear combinations $ f(c_1·(vec(u)_1,vec(w)_1)+c_2· (vec(u)_2,vec(w)_2)) =f((c_1vec(u)_1+c_2vec(u)_2,c_1vec(w)_1+c_2vec(w)_2)) =c_1vec(u)_1+c_2vec(u)_2+c_1vec(w)_1+c_2vec(w)_2 =c_1vec(u)_1+c_1vec(w)_1+c_2vec(u)_2+c_2vec(w)_2 =c_1· f((vec(u)_1,vec(w)_1)) +c_2· f((vec(u)_2,vec(w)_2)) $ and so it is an isomorphism.                    In the prior subsection, after stating the definition of isomorphism, we gave some results supporting our sense that such a map describes spaces as ``the same.'' Here we will develop this intuition. When two (unequal) spaces are isomorphic we think of them as almost equal, as equivalent. We shall make that precise by proving that the relationship `is isomorphic~to' is an equivalence relation.    The inverse of an isomorphism is also an isomorphism.      Suppose that $V$ is isomorphic to $W$ via $f: V → W$. An isomorphism is a correspondence between the sets so $f$ has an inverse function $map{f^{-1}}{W}{V}$ that is also a correspondence.spacefactor(1000)    We will show that because $f$ preserves linear combinations, so also does $f^{-1}$. Suppose that $vec(w)_1,vec(w)_2 in W$. Because it is an isomorphism, $f$ is onto and there are $vec(v)_1, vec(v)_2 in V$ such that $ vec(w)_1=f(vec(v)_1) $ and $ vec(w)_2=f(vec(v)_2) $. Then $ f^{-1}(c_1·vec(w)_1+c_2·vec(w)_2) =f^{-1}[(c_1· f(vec(v)_1) +c_2· f(vec(v)_2)]) =f^{-1}(f[(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2)]) =c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2 =c_1· f^{-1}(vec(w)_1)+c_2· f^{-1}(vec(w)_2) $ since $ f^{-1}(vec(w)_1)=vec(v)_1 $ and $ f^{-1}(vec(w)_2)=vec(v)_2 $. With that, by 's second statement, this map preserves structure.      Isomorphism is an equivalence relation between vector spaces.      We must prove that the relation is symmetric, reflexive, and transitive.  To check reflexivity, that any space is isomorphic to itself, consider the identity map. It is clearly one-to-one and onto. This shows that it preserves linear combinations. $ id(c_1· vec(v)_1+c_2· vec(v)_2) =c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2 =c_1· id(vec(v)_1)+c_2· id(vec(v)_2) $    Symmetry, that if $V$ is isomorphic to~$W$ then also $W$ is isomorphic to~$V$, holds by since each isomorphism map from $V$ to $W$ is paired with an isomorphism from $W$ to $V$.    To finish we must check transitivity, that if $V$ is isomorphic to $W$ and $W$ is isomorphic to $U$ then $V$ is isomorphic to $U$. Let $f: V → W$ and $g: W → U$ be isomorphisms. Consider their composition $map{∘{g}{f}}{V}{U}$. Because the composition of correspondences is a correspondence, we need only check that the composition preserves linear combinations. $ ∘{g}{f}\:[(c_1·vec(v)_1+c_2·vec(v)_2]) =g[(f(c_1· vec(v)_1+c_2·vec(v)_2)]) =g[(c_1· f(vec(v)_1)+c_2· f(vec(v)_2)]) =c_1· g[(f(vec(v)_1))+c_2· g(f(vec(v)_2)]) =c_1·(∘{g}{f})(vec(v)_1) +c_2·(∘{g}{f})(vec(v)_2) $ Thus the composition is an isomorphism.    Since it is an equivalence, isomorphism partitions the universe of vector spaces into classes: each space is in one and only one isomorphism class.  raisebox(.5in){ All finite dimensional vector spaces: }  raisebox(.3in){ $V≅ W$ }  The next result characterizes  these classes by dimension. That is, we can describe each class simply by giving the number that is the dimension of all of the spaces in that class.     Vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.    In this double implication statement the proof of each half involves a significant idea so we will do the two separately.    If spaces are isomorphic then they have the same dimension.      We shall show that an isomorphism of two spaces gives a correspondence between their bases. That is, we shall show that if $ f: V → W $ is an isomorphism and a basis for the domain $V$ is $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ then its image $ D=sequence{f(vec(β)_1),...,f(vec(β)_n)} $ is a basis for the codomain $ W $. (The other half of the correspondence, that for any basis of $W$ the inverse image is a basis for $V$, follows from the fact that $f^{-1}$ is also an isomorphism and so we can apply the prior sentence to $f^{-1}$.)    To see that $ D $ spans $ W $, fix any $ vec(w) in W $. Because $ f $ is an isomorphism it is onto and so there is a $ vec(v) in V $ with $ vec(w)=f(vec(v)) $. Expand $ vec(v) $ as a combination of basis vectors. $ vec(w)=f(vec(v)) =f(v_1vec(β)_1+...+v_nvec(β)_n) =v_1· f(vec(β)_1)+...+v_n· f(vec(β)_n) $ For linear independence of $D$, if $ 0_W =c_1f(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nf(vec(β)_n) =f(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n) $ then, since $ f $ is one-to-one and so the only vector sent to $ 0_W $ is $ 0_V $, we have that $ 0_V=c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n $, which implies that all of the $ c $'s are zero.      If spaces have the same dimension then they are isomorphic.      We will prove that any space of dimension~$n$ is isomorphic to $ ℝ^n$. Then we will have that all such spaces are isomorphic to each other by transitivity, which was shown in .    Let $V$ be $ n $-dimensional. Fix a basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ for the domain $V$. Consider the operation of representing the members of $V$ with respect to $B$ as a function from $V$ to $ ℝ^n$. $ vec(v)=v_1vec(β)_1+...+v_nvec(β)_n Rep_B ↓[v_1 ... v_n] $  It is well-definedspacefactor(1000)  since every $ vec(v) $ has one and only one such representation (see  following this proof).   This function is one-to-one because if $ Rep_B(u_1vec(β)_1+...+u_nvec(β)_n) =Rep_B(v_1vec(β)_1+...+v_nvec(β)_n) $ then $ [u_1 ... u_n] = [v_1 ... v_n] $ and so $ u_1=v_1 $, ..., $u_n=v_n$, implying that the original arguments $ u_1vec(β)_1+...+u_nvec(β)_n $ and $ v_1vec(β)_1+...+v_nvec(β)_n$ are equal.    This function is onto; any member of $ ℝ^n$ $ vec(w)=[w_1 ... w_n] $ is the image of some $ vec(v) in V $, namely $ vec(w)=rep{w_1vec(β)_1+...+w_nvec(β)_n}{B} $.    Finally, this function preserves structure. $ rep{r·vec(u)+s·vec(v)}{B} =rep{(ru_1+sv_1)vec(β)_1+...+(ru_n+sv_n)vec(β)_n}{B} =[ru_1+sv_1 ... ru_n+sv_n] =r·[u_1 ... u_n]+s·[v_1 ... v_n] =r·rep{vec(u)}{B}+s·rep{vec(v)}{B} $  Therefore $Rep_B$ is an isomorphism. Consequently any $n$-dimensional space is isomorphic to $ ℝ^n$.      The proof has a sentence about `well-defined.' Its point is that to be an isomorphism $Rep_B$ must be a function, and the definition of function requires that for all inputs the associated output exists and is determined by the input. So we must check that every $vec(v)$ is associated with at least one~$Rep_B(vec(v))$, and no more than one.  In the proof we express elements $vec(v)$ of the domain space as combinations of members of the basis~$B$ and then associate $vec(v)$ with the column vector of coefficients. That there is at least one expansion of each~$vec(v)$ holds because $B$ is a basis and so spans the space.  The worry that there is no more than one associated member of the codomain is subtler. A contrasting example, where an association fails this unique output requirement, illuminates the issue. Let the domain be $ polyspace(_2) $ and consider a set that is not a basis (it is not linearly independent, although it does span the space). $ A={1+0x+0x^2, 0+1x+0x^2, 0+0x+1x^2, 1+1x+2x^2} $ Call those polynomials $vec(α)_1$, ..., $vec(α)_4$. In contrast to the situation when the set is a basis, here there can be more than one expression of a domain vector in terms   of members of the set. For instance, consider $ vec(v)=1+x+x^2 $. Here are two different expansions. $ vec(v)=1vec(α)_1+1vec(α)_2+1vec(α)_3+0vec(α)_4  vec(v)=0vec(α)_1+0vec(α)_2- 1vec(α)_3+1vec(α)_4 $ So this input vector~$vec(v)$ is associated with more than one column. $ [1 1 1 0]  [0 0 -1 1] $ Thus, with~$A$ the association is not well-defined. (The issue is that $A$ is not linearly independent; to show uniqueness Theorem~Two.III.'s proof uses only linear independence.)  In general, any time that we define a function we must check that output values are well-defined. Most of the time that condition is perfectly obvious but in the above proof it needs verification. See .     A finite-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to one and only one of the $ ℝ^n$.    This gives us a collection of representatives of the isomorphism classes.  raisebox(.5in){ All finite dimensional vector spaces: }  raisebox(.3in){ One representative per class }   The proofs above pack many ideas into a small space. Through the rest of this chapter we'll consider these ideas again, and fill them out. As a taste of this we will expand here on the proof of .  For example The space $matspace(_){N by N}$ of $N by N$ matrices is isomorphic to $ ℝ^4$. With this basis for the domain $ B=sequence{([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 1 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 1 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } $ the isomorphism given in the lemma, the representation map $f_1=Rep_B$, carries the entries over. $ ([ a b c d ]) f_1 ↓ [a b c d] $ One way to think of the map $f_1$ is:~fix the basis $B$ for the domain, use the standard basis $stdbasis(_4)$ for the codomain, and associate $vec(β)_1$ with $vec(e)_1$, $vec(β)_2$ with $vec(e)_2$, etc. Then extend this association to all of the members of two spaces. $ ([ a b c d ]) =avec(β)_1+bvec(β)_2+cvec(β)_3+dvec(β)_4 f_1 ↓ avec(e)_1+bvec(e)_2+cvec(e)_3+dvec(e)_4 =[a b c d] $  We can do the same thing with different bases, for instance, taking this basis for the domain. $ A=sequence{ ([ 2 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 2 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 2 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 2 ]) } $ Associating corresponding members of $A$ and $stdbasis(_4)$ gives this. $ ([ a b c d ]) =(a/2)vec(α)_1+(b/2)vec(α)_2 +(c/2)vec(α)_3+(d/2)vec(α)_4 f_2 ↓ (a/2)vec(e)_1+(b/2)vec(e)_2+(c/2)vec(e)_3+(d/2)vec(e)_4 =[a/2 b/2 c/2 d/2] $ gives rise to an isomorphism that is different than $f_1$.  The prior map arose by changing the basis for the domain. We can also change the basis for the codomain. Go back to the basis $B$ above and use this basis for the codomain. $ D=sequence{[1 0 0 0], [0 1 0 0], [0 0 0 1], [0 0 1 0]} $ Associate $vec(β)_1$ with $vec(δ)_1$, etc. Extending that gives another isomorphism. $ ([ a b c d ]) =avec(β)_1+bvec(β)_2+cvec(β)_3+dvec(β)_4 f_3 ↓ avec(δ)_1+bvec(δ)_2+cvec(δ)_3+dvec(δ)_4 =[a b d c] $   We close with a recap. Recall that the first chapter defines two matrices to be row equivalent if they can be derived from each other by row operations. There we showed that relation is an equivalence and so the collection of matrices is partitioned into classes, where all the matrices that are row equivalent together fall into a single class. Then for insight into which matrices are in each class we gave representatives for the classes, the reduced echelon form matrices.  In this section we have followed that pattern except that the notion here of ``the same'' is vector space isomorphism. We defined it and established some properties, including that it is an equivalence. Then, as before, we developed a list of class representatives to help us understand the partition- it classifies vector spaces by dimension.  In Chapter Two, with the definition of vector spaces, we seemed to have opened up our studies to many examples of new structures besides the familiar $ ℝ^n$'s. We now know that isn't the case. Any finite-dimensional vector space is actually ``the same'' as a real space.       Decide if the spaces are isomorphic.  $ ℝ^2 $,~$ ℝ^4 $ $ polyspace(_5) $,~$ ℝ^5 $ $ matspace(_){N by M} $,~$ ℝ^6 $ $ polyspace(_5) $,~$ matspace(_){N by M} $ $ matspace(_){N by M} $,~$ matspace(_){N by M} $   Each pair of spaces is isomorphic if and only if the two have the same dimension. We can, when there is an isomorphism, state a map, but it isn't strictly necessary.  No, they have different dimensions. No, they have different dimensions. Yes, they have the same dimension. One isomorphism is this. $ ([ a b c d e f ]) ↦ [a ... f] $ Yes, they have the same dimension. This is an isomorphism. $ a+bx+·s+fx^5 ↦ ([ a b c d e f ]) $ Yes, both have dimension $ 2k $.    Consider the isomorphism $ map(Representation of (·)){polyspace(_1)}{ ℝ^2} $ where $ B=1,1+x $. Find the image of each of these elements of the domain.  $ 3-2x $; $ 2+2x $; $ x $    $ Representation of (3-2x)=[5 -2] $ $ [0 2] $ $ [-1 1] $    Show that if $ m ≠ n $ then $ ℝ^m not ≅ ℝ^n $.  They have different dimensions.   Is $ matspace(_){N by M}≅matspace(_){N by M} $?  Yes, both are $ mn $-dimensional.   Are any two planes through the origin in $ ℝ^3 $ isomorphic?  Yes, any two (nondegenerate) planes are both two-dimensional vector spaces.   Find a set of equivalence class representatives other than the set of $ ℝ^n $'s.  There are many answers, one is the set of $ polyspace(_k) $ (taking $ polyspace(_){-1} $ to be the trivial vector space).   True or false:~between any $ n $-dimensional space and $ ℝ^n $ there is exactly one isomorphism.  False (except when $ n=0 $). For instance, if $ f: V → ℝ^n $ is an isomorphism then multiplying by any nonzero scalar, gives another, different, isomorphism. (Between trivial spaces the isomorphisms are unique; the only map possible is $0_V↦ 0_W$.)   Can a vector space be isomorphic to one of its (proper) subspaces?  No. A proper subspace has a strictly lower dimension than it's superspace; if $U$ is a proper subspace of $V$ then any linearly independent subset of $U$ must have fewer than $dim(V)$ members or else that set would be a basis for $V$, and $U$ wouldn't be proper.   This subsection shows that for any isomorphism, the inverse map is also an isomorphism. This subsection also shows that for a fixed basis $ B $ of an $ n $-dimensional vector space $ V $, the map $ Rep_B: V → ℝ^n $ is an isomorphism. Find the inverse of this map.  Where $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $, the inverse is this. $ [c_1 ... c_n] ↦ c_1vec(β)_1+·s+c_nvec(β)_n $   Prove these facts about matrices.  The row space of a matrix is isomorphic to the column space of its transpose. The row space of a matrix is isomorphic to its column space.   All three spaces have dimension equal to the rank of the matrix.   Show that the function from is well-defined.  We must show that if $ vec(a)=vec(b) $ then $ f(vec(a))=f(vec(b)) $. So suppose that $a_1vec(β)_1+...+a_nvec(β)_n =b_1vec(β)_1+...+b_nvec(β)_n$. Each vector in a vector space (here, the domain space) has a unique representation as a linear combination of basis vectors, so we can conclude that $ a_1=b_1 $, ..., $a_n=b_n $. Thus, $ f(vec(a)) =[a_1 ... a_n]=[b_1 ... b_n] =f(vec(b)) $ and so the function is well-defined.   Is the proof of valid when $ n=0 $?  Yes, because a zero-dimensional space is a trivial space.   For each, decide if it is a set of isomorphism class representatives.  $ { ℂ^k such that k in ℕ} $ ${polyspace(_k) such that k in {-1,0,1,...}}$ $ {matspace(_){{N by M} such that m,n in ℕ} $    No, this collection has no spaces of odd dimension. Yes, because $polyspace(_){k}≅ ℝ^{k+1}$. No, for instance, $ matspace(_){N by M}≅matspace(_){N by M} $.    Let $ f $ be a correspondence between vector spaces $ V $ and $ W $ (that is, a map that is one-to-one and onto). Show that the spaces $ V $ and $ W $ are isomorphic via $ f $ if and only if there are bases $ B⊆ V $ and $ D⊆ W $ such that corresponding vectors have the same coordinates: $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=rep{f(vec(v))}{D} $.  One direction is easy:~if the two are isomorphic via $ f $ then for any basis $ B⊆ V $, the set $ D=f(B) $ is also a basis (this is shown in ). The check that corresponding vectors have the same coordinates: $ f(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n) =c_1f(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nf(vec(β)_n) =c_1vec(δ)_1+...+c_nvec(δ)_n $ is routine.  For the other half, assume that there are bases such that corresponding vectors have the same coordinates with respect to those bases. Because $ f $ is a correspondence, to show that it is an isomorphism, we need only show that it preserves structure. Because $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=rep{f(vec(v))}{D} $, the map $ f $ preserves structure if and only if representations preserve addition: $ rep{vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2}{B}=rep{vec(v)_1}{B}+rep{vec(v)_2}{B} $ and scalar multiplication: $ rep{r·vec(v)}{B}=r·rep{vec(v)}{B} $ The addition calculation is this: $ (c_1+d_1)vec(β)_1+...+(c_n+d_n)vec(β)_n =c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n +d_1vec(β)_1+...+d_nvec(β)_n $, and the scalar multiplication calculation is similar.   Consider the isomorphism $ Rep_B: polyspace(_3) → ℝ^4 $.  Vectors in a real space are orthogonal if and only if their dot product is zero. Give a definition of orthogonality for polynomials. The derivative of a member of $ polyspace(_3) $ is in $ polyspace(_3) $. Give a definition of the derivative of a vector in $ ℝ^4 $.    Pulling the definition back from $ ℝ^4 $ to $ polyspace(_3) $ gives that $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 $ is orthogonal to $ b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+b_3x^3 $ if and only if $ a_0b_0+a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3=0 $. A natural definition is this. $ D([a_0 a_1 a_2 a_3])= [a_1 2a_2 3a_3 0] $    Does every correspondence between bases, when extended to the spaces, give an isomorphism? That is, suppose that $ V $ is a vector space with basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ and that $ f: B → W $ is a correspondence such that $ D=sequence{f(vec(β)_1),...,f(vec(β)_n)} $ is basis for~$W$. Must $map(f̂){V}{W}$ sending $vec(v)=c_1vec(β)_1+·s+c_nvec(β)_n$ to $ f̂(vec(v))=c_1f̂(vec(β)_1)+·s+c_nf̂(vec(β)_n)$ be an isomorphism?  Yes.  First, $ f̂ $ is well-defined because every member of $ V $ has one and only one representation as a linear combination of elements of $ B $.  Second we must show that $f̂$ is one-to-one and onto. It is one-to-one because every member of $ W $ has only one representation as a linear combination of elements of $ D $, since $D$ is a basis. And $ f̂ $ is onto because every member of $ W $ has at least one representation as a linear combination of members of $ D $.  Finally, preservation of structure is routine to check. For instance, here is the preservation of addition calculation. $ f̂((c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n)+ (d_1vec(β)_1+...+d_nvec(β)_n)) $ =f̂((c_1+d_1)vec(β)_1+...+(c_n+d_n)vec(β)_n) =(c_1+d_1)f(vec(β)_1)+...+(c_n+d_n)f(vec(β)_n) =c_1f(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nf(vec(β)_n) +d_1f(vec(β)_1)+...+d_nf(vec(β)_n) =f̂(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n)+ +f̂(d_1vec(β)_1+...+d_nvec(β)_n) $ $ (The second equality is the definition of $f̂$.) Preservation of scalar multiplication is similar.   textit{(Requires the subsection on Combining Subspaces, which is optional.)} Suppose that $ V=V_1⊕ V_2 $ and that $ V $ is isomorphic to the space $ U $ under the map $ f $. Show that $ U=f(V_1)⊕ f(U_2) $.  Because $ V_1 intersection V_2={0_V} $ and $ f $ is one-to-one we have that $ f(V_1) intersection f(V_2)={0_U} $. To finish, count the dimensions: $ dim(U)=dim(V)=dim(V_1)+dim(V_2)=dim(f(V_1))+dim(f(V_2)) $, as required.  Show that this is not a well-defined function from the rational numbers to the integers: with each fraction, associate the value of its numerator.  Rational numbers have many representations, e.g., $ 1/2=3/6 $, and the numerators can vary among representations.          The definition of isomorphism has two conditions. In this section we will consider the second one. We will study maps that are required only to preserve structure, maps that are not also required to be correspondences.  Experience shows that these maps are tremendously useful. For one thing we shall see in the second subsection below that while isomorphisms describe how spaces are the same, we can think of these maps as describing how spaces are alike.             A function between vector spaces $ h: V → W $ that preserves addition  if $ vec(v)_1,vec(v)_2 in V $ then $ h(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)=h(vec(v)_1)+h(vec(v)_2) $  and scalar multiplication  if $ vec(v) in V $ and $ r in ℝ $ then $ h(r·vec(v))=r· h(vec(v)) $  is a homomorphism }  or linear map }.    For example The projection map $ π: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2 $ $ [x y z] π ↓ [x y] $ is a homomorphism. It preserves addition $ π([x_1 y_1 z_1]+[x_2 y_2 z_2]) = π([x_1+x_2 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2]) = [x_1+x_2 y_1+y_2] = π([x_1 y_1 z_1]) + π([x_2 y_2 z_2]) $ and scalar multiplication. $ π(r·[x_1 y_1 z_1]) = π([rx_1 ry_1 rz_1]) = [rx_1 ry_1] = r·π([x_1 y_1 z_1]) $ This is not an isomorphism since it is not one-to-one. For instance, both $0$ and $vec(e)_3$ in $ ℝ^3$ map to the zero vector in $ ℝ^2$.   For example The domain and codomain can be other than spaces of column vectors. Both of these are homomorphisms; the verifications are straightforward.  $ f_1: polyspace(_2) → polyspace(_3) $ given by $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 ↦ a_0x+(a_1/2)x^2+(a_2/3)x^3 $ $ map(f_2){M_{N by N}}{ ℝ} $ given by $ ([ a b c d ]) ↦ a+d $    For example Between any two spaces there is a zero homomorphism,  mapping every vector in the domain to the zero vector in the codomain.   For example These two suggest why we use the term `linear map'.  The map $ g: ℝ^3 → ℝ $ given by $ [x y z] g ↓ 3x+2y-4.5z $ is linear, that is, is a homomorphism. The check is easy. In contrast, the map $ map(ĝ){ ℝ^3}{ ℝ} $ given by $ [x y z] mapsunder(ĝ) 3x+2y-4.5z+1 $ is not linear. To show this we need only produce a single linear combination that the map does not preserve. Here is one. $ ĝ([0 0 0]+[1 0 0])=4  ĝ([0 0 0]) +ĝ([1 0 0])=5 $ The first of these two maps $ t_1,t_2: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2 $ is linear while the second is not. $ [x y z] t_1 ↓ [5x-2y x+y]  [x y z] t_2 ↓ [5x-2y xy] $ Finding a linear combination that the second map does not preserve is easy.       So one way to think of `homomorphism' is that we are generalizing `isomorphism' (by dropping the condition that the map is a correspondence), motivated by the observation that many of the properties of isomorphisms have only to do with the map's structure-preservation property. The next two results are examples of this motivation. In the prior section we saw a proof for each that only uses preservation of addition and preservation of scalar multiplication, and therefore applies to homomorphisms.    A homomorphism sends the zero vector to the zero vector.      The following are equivalent for any map $ f: V → W $ between vector spaces.   $f$ is a homomorphism  $f(c_1·vec(v)_1+c_2·vec(v)_2) =c_1· f(vec(v)_1)+c_2· f(vec(v)_2)$ for any $ c_1,c_2 in ℝ $ and $ vec(v)_1,vec(v)_2 in V $  $f(c_1·vec(v)_1+...+c_n·vec(v)_n) =c_1· f(vec(v)_1)+...+c_n· f(vec(v)_n)$ for any $ c_1,...,c_n in ℝ $ and $ vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_n in V $     For example The function $ f: ℝ^2 → ℝ^4 $ given by $ [x y] f ↓ [x/2 0 x+y 3y] $ is linear since it satisfies item~(2). $ colvec{r_1(x_1/2)+r_2(x_2/2) 0 r_1(x_1+y_1)+r_2(x_2+y_2) r_1(3y_1)+r_2(3y_2)} = r_1[x_1/2 0 x_1+y_1 3y_1] + r_2[x_2/2 0 x_2+y_2 3y_2] $   However, some things that hold for isomorphisms fail to hold for homomorphisms. One example is in the proof of Lemma~I., which shows that an isomorphism between spaces gives a correspondence between their bases. Homomorphisms do not give any such correspondence; shows this and another example is the zero map between two nontrivial spaces. Instead, for homomorphisms we have a weaker but still very useful result.    A homomorphism is determined by its action on a basis:~if $V$ is a vector space with basis $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $, if $W$ is a vector space, and if $ vec(w)_1,...,vec(w)_n in W $ (these codomain elements need not be distinct) then there exists a homomorphism from $ V $ to $ W $ sending each $ vec(β)_i $ to $ vec(w)_i $, and that homomorphism is unique.      For any input $vec(v) in V$ let its expression with respect to the basis be $ vec(v)=c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n $. Define the associated output by using the same coordinates $h(vec(v))=c_1vec(w)_1+...+c_nvec(w)_n$. This is well defined because, with respect to the basis, the representation of each domain vector $ vec(v) $ is unique.    This map is a homomorphism because it preserves linear combinations: where $ vec(v_1)=c_1vec(β)_1+·s+c_nvec(β)_n $ and $ vec(v_2)=d_1vec(β)_1+·s+d_nvec(β)_n $, here is the calculation. $ h(r_1vec(v)_1+r_2vec(v)_2) =h((r_1c_1+r_2d_1)vec(β)_1+...+(r_1c_n+r_2d_n)vec(β)_n) =(r_1c_1+r_2d_1)vec(w)_1+...+(r_1c_n+r_2d_n)vec(w)_n =r_1h(vec(v)_1)+r_2h(vec(v)_2) $    This map is unique because if $ map(ĥ){V}{W} $ is another homomorphism satisfying that $ ĥ(vec(β)_i)=vec(w)_i $ for each $ i $ then $ h $ and $ ĥ $ have the same effect on all of the vectors in the domain. $ ĥ(vec(v)) =ĥ(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n) =c_1 ĥ(vec(β)_1)+...+c_n ĥ(vec(β)_n) =c_1vec(w)_1+...+c_nvec(w)_n =h(vec(v)) $ They have the same action so they are the same function.      Let $V$ and~$W$ be vector spaces and let $B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n}$ be a basis for~$V$. A function defined on that basis $f: B → W$ is extended linearly to a function $map(f̂){V}{W}$ if for all $vec(v) in V$ such that $vec(v)=c_1vec(β)_1+·s+c_nvec(β)_n$, the action of the map is $f̂(vec(v))=c_1· f(vec(β)_1) +·s+c_n· f(vec(β)_n)$.     For example If we specify a map $ h: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ that acts on the standard basis $stdbasis(_2)$ in this way $ h([1 0])=[-1 1]  h([0 1])=[-4 4] $ then we have also specified the action of $h$ on any other member of the domain. For instance, the value of $h$ on this argument $ h([3 -2])=h(3· [1 0]-2· [0 1]) =3· h([1 0])-2· h([0 1]) =[5 -5] $ is a direct consequence of the value of $h$ on the basis vectors.   Later in this chapter we shall develop a convenient scheme for computations like this one, using matrices.       A linear map from a space into itself $ t: V → V $ is a linear transformation }.     In this book we use `linear transformation' only in the case where the codomain equals the domain. However, be aware that other sources may instead use it as a synonym for `homomorphism'.   For example The map on $ ℝ^2$ that projects all vectors down to the $x$-axis is a linear transformation. $ [x y]↦[x 0] $   For example The derivative map $ d/dx: polyspace(_n) → polyspace(_n) $ $ a_0+a_1x+·s+a_nx^n d/dx ↓ a_1+2a_2x+3a_3x^2+·s+na_nx^{n-1} $ is a linear transformation as this result from calculus shows: $ d(c_1f+c_2g)/dx=c_1(df/dx)+c_2(dg/dx) $.   For example The matrix transpose operation $ ([ a b c d ]) ↦ ([ a c b d ]) $ is a linear transformation of $ matspace(_){N by N} $. (Transpose is one-to-one and onto and so is in fact an automorphism.)   We finish this subsection about maps by recalling that we can linearly combine maps. For instance, for these maps from $ ℝ^2 $ to itself $ [x y] f ↓ [2x 3x-2y] and [x y] g ↓ [0 5x] $ the linear combination $ 5f-2g $ is also a transformation of~$R^2$. $ [x y] 5f-2g ↓ [10x 5x-10y] $    For vector spaces $ V $ and $ W $, the set of linear functions from $ V $ to $ W $ is itself a vector space, a subspace of the space of all functions from $ V $ to $ W $.     We denote the space of linear maps from $V$ to~$W$ by $ linmaps(V){W} $.     This set is non-empty because it contains the zero homomorphism. So to show that it is a subspace we need only check that it is closed under the operations. Let $ f,g: V → W $ be linear. Then the operation of function addition is preserved $ (f+g)(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2) =f(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2) + g(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2) =c_1f(vec(v)_1)+c_2f(vec(v)_2) +c_1g(vec(v)_1)+c_2g(vec(v)_2) =c_1[(f+g])(vec(v)_1)+c_2[(f+g])(vec(v)_2) $ as is the operation of scalar multiplication of a function. $ (r· f)(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2) =r(c_1f(vec(v)_1)+c_2f(vec(v)_2)) =c_1(r· f)(vec(v)_1)+c_2(r· f)(vec(v)_2) $ Hence $ linmaps(V){W} $ is a subspace.    We started this section by defining `homomorphism' as a generalization of `isomorphism', by isolating the structure preservation property. Some of the points about isomorphisms carried over unchanged, while we adapted others.  Note, however, that the idea of `homomorphism' is in no way somehow secondary to that of `isomorphism'. In the rest of this chapter we shall work mostly with homomorphisms. This is partly because any statement made about homomorphisms is automatically true about isomorphisms but more because, while the isomorphism concept is more natural, our experience will show that the homomorphism concept is more fruitful and more central to progress.    Decide if each $ h: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2 $ is linear.  $ h([x y z])=[x x+y+z] $ $ h([x y z])=[0 0] $ $ h([x y z])=[1 1] $ $ h([x y z])=[2x+y 3y-4z] $    Yes. The verification is straightforward. $ h( c_1·[x_1 y_1 z_1] +c_2·[x_2 y_2 z_2] ) =h( [c_1x_1+c_2x_2 c_1y_1+c_2y_2 c_1z_1+c_2z_2] ) =colvec{c_1x_1+c_2x_2 c_1x_1+c_2x_2+c_1y_1+c_2y_2+c_1z_1+c_2z_2} =c_1·[x_1 x_1+y_1+z_1] +c_2·[x_2 c_2+y_2+z_2] =c_1· h([x_1 y_1 z_1]) +c_2· h([x_2 y_2 z_2]) $ Yes. The verification is easy. $ h(c_1·[x_1 y_1 z_1] +c_2·[x_2 y_2 z_2]) =h( [c_1x_1+c_2x_2 c_1y_1+c_2y_2 c_1z_1+c_2z_2] ) =[0 0] =c_1· h([x_1 y_1 z_1]) +c_2· h([x_2 y_2 z_2]) $ No. An example of an addition that is not respected is this. $ h([0 0 0]+[0 0 0]) =[1 1] ≠ h([0 0 0])+h([0 0 0]) $ Yes. The verification is straightforward. $ h( c_1·[x_1 y_1 z_1] +c_2·[x_2 y_2 z_2] ) =h( [c_1x_1+c_2x_2 c_1y_1+c_2y_2 c_1z_1+c_2z_2] ) =colvec{2(c_1x_1+c_2x_2)+(c_1y_1+c_2y_2) 3(c_1y_1+c_2y_2)-4(c_1z_1+c_2z_2)} =c_1·[2x_1+y_1 3y_1-4z_1] +c_2·[2x_2+y_2 3y_2-4z_2] =c_1· h([x_1 y_1 z_1]) +c_2· h([x_2 y_2 z_2]) $    Decide if each map $ map(h){matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ} $ is linear.  $ h(([ a b c d ]))=a+d $ $ h(([ a b c d ]))=ad-bc $ $ h(([ a b c d ]))=2a+3b+c-d $ $ h(([ a b c d ]))=a^2+b^2 $   For each, we must either check that the map preserves linear combinations or give an example of a linear combination that is not.  Yes. The check that it preserves combinations is routine. $ h(r_1·([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ]) +r_2·([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ])) =h(([ r_1a_1+r_2a_2 r_1b_1+r_2b_2 r_1c_1+r_2c_2 r_1d_1+r_2d_2 ])) =(r_1a_1+r_2a_2)+(r_1d_1+r_2d_2) =r_1(a_1+d_1)+r_2(a_2+d_2) =r_1· h(([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ])) +r_2· h(([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ])) $ No. For instance, not preserved is multiplication by the scalar $2$. $ h(2·([ 1 0 0 1 ])) =h(([ 2 0 0 2 ])) =4 while 2· h(([ 1 0 0 1 ])) =2· 1=2 $ Yes. This is the check that it preserves combinations of two members of the domain. $ h(r_1·([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ]) +r_2·([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ])) $ =h(([ r_1a_1+r_2a_2 r_1b_1+r_2b_2 r_1c_1+r_2c_2 r_1d_1+r_2d_2 ])) =2(r_1a_1+r_2a_2)+3(r_1b_1+r_2b_2) +(r_1c_1+r_2c_2)-(r_1d_1+r_2d_2) =r_1(2a_1+3b_1+c_1-d_1) +r_2(2a_2+3b_2+c_2-d_2) =r_1· h(([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ]) +r_2· h(([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ])) $ $ No. An example of a combination that is not preserved is that doing it one way gives this $ h(([ 1 0 0 0 ]) +([ 1 0 0 0 ])) =h(([ 2 0 0 0 ])) =4 $ while the other way gives this. $ h(([ 1 0 0 0 ])) +h(([ 1 0 0 0 ])) =1+1 =2 $    Show that these are homomorphisms. Are they inverse to each other?  $ d/dx: polyspace(_3) → polyspace(_2) $ given by $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 $ maps to $ a_1+2a_2x+3a_3x^2 $ $ int: polyspace(_2) → polyspace(_3) $ given by $ b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2 $ maps to $ b_0x+(b_1/2)x^2+(b_2/3)x^3 $   The check that each is a homomorphisms is routine. Here is the check for the differentiation map. $ (d/dx)(r· (a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3) +s· (b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+b_3x^3)) $ =(d/dx)((ra_0+sb_0)+(ra_1+sb_1)x+(ra_2+sb_2)x^2 +(ra_3+sb_3)x^3) =(ra_1+sb_1)+2(ra_2+sb_2)x+3(ra_3+sb_3)x^2 =r· (a_1+2a_2x+3a_3x^2)+s· (b_1+2b_2x+3b_3x^2) =r· (d/dx)(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3) +s· (d/dx) (b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+b_3x^3) $ $ (An alternate proof is to simply note that this is a property of differentiation that is familiar from calculus.)  These two maps are not inverses as this composition does not act as the identity map on this element of the domain. $ 1 inpolyspace(_3d/dx) ↓ 0 inpolyspace(_2) int ↓ 0 inpolyspace(_3) $   Is (perpendicular) projection from $ ℝ^3 $ to the $ xz $-plane a homomorphism? Projection to the $ yz $-plane? To the $ x $-axis? The $ y $-axis? The $ z $-axis? Projection to the origin?  Each of these projections is a homomorphism. Projection to the $xz$-plane and to the $yz$-plane are these maps. $ [x y z]↦[x 0 z]  [x y z]↦[0 y z] $ Projection to the $x$-axis, to the $y$-axis, and to the $z$-axis are these maps. $ [x y z]↦[x 0 0]  [x y z]↦[0 y 0]  [x y z]↦[0 0 z] $ And projection to the origin is this map. $ [x y z]↦[0 0 0] $ Verification that each is a homomorphism is straightforward. (The last one, of course, is the zero transformation on $ ℝ^3$.)  Verify that each map is a homomorphism.  $h: polyspace(_3) → ℝ^2$ given by $ ax^2+bx+c↦ [a+b a+c] $ $f: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3$ given by $ [x y]↦[0 x-y 3y] $     This verifies that the map preserves linear combinations. By that suffices to show that it is a homomorphism. $ h(d_1(a_1x^2+b_1x+c_1)+d_2(a_2x^2+b_2x+c_2)) $ =h((d_1a_1+d_2a_2)x^2+(d_1b_1+d_2b_2)x+(d_1c_1+d_2c_2)) =colvec{(d_1a_1+d_2a_2)+(d_1b_1+d_2b_2) (d_1a_1+d_2a_2)+(d_1c_1+d_2c_2)} =[d_1a_1+d_1b_1 d_1a_1+d_1c_1]+ [d_2a_2+d_2b_2 d_2a_2+d_2c_2] =d_1[a_1+b_1 a_1+c_1]+ d_2[a_2+b_2 a_2+c_2] =d_1· h(a_1x^2+b_1x+c_1)+d_2· h(a_2x^2+b_2x+c_2) $ $  It preserves linear combinations. $ f(a_1[x_1 y_1]+a_2[x_2 y_2]) =f([a_1x_1+a_2x_2 a_1y_1+a_2y_2]) =colvec{0 (a_1x_1+a_2x_2)-(a_1y_1+a_2y_2) 3(a_1y_1+a_2y_2) } =a_1[0 x_1-y_1 3y_1] +a_2[0 x_2-y_2 3y_2] =a_1f([x_1 y_1])+a_2f([x_2 y_2]) $      Show that, while the maps from preserve linear operations, they are not isomorphisms.  The first is not onto; for instance, there is no polynomial that is sent the constant polynomial $p(x)=1$. The second is not one-to-one; both of these members of the domain $ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]) and ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) $ map to the same member of the codomain, $1 in ℝ$.   Is an identity map a linear transformation?  Yes;~in any space $ id(c· vec(v)+d· vec(w)) = c· vec(v)+d· vec(w) = c·id(vec(v))+d·id(vec(w)) $.   Stating that a function is `linear' is different than stating that its graph is a line.  The function $ f_1: ℝ → ℝ $ given by $ f_1(x)=2x-1 $ has a graph that is a line. Show that it is not a linear function. The function $ f_2: ℝ^2 → ℝ $ given by $ [x y] ↦ x+2y $ does not have a graph that is a line. Show that it is a linear function.    This map does not preserve structure since $ f(1+1)=3 $, while $ f(1)+f(1)=2 $. The check is routine. $ f(r_1·[x_1 y_1]+r_2·[x_2 y_2]) =f([r_1x_1+r_2x_2 r_1y_1+r_2y_2]) =(r_1x_1+r_2x_2)+2(r_1y_1+r_2y_2) =r_1· (x_1+2y_1)+r_2· (x_2+2y_2) =r_1· f([x_1 y_1])+r_2· f([x_2 y_2]) $    Part of the definition of a linear function is that it respects addition. Does a linear function respect subtraction?  Yes. Where $ h: V → W $ is linear, $ h(vec(u)-vec(v)) =h(vec(u)+(-1)·vec(v)) =h(vec(u))+(-1)· h(vec(v)) =h(vec(u))-h(vec(v)) $.   Assume that $ h $ is a linear transformation of $ V $ and that $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ is a basis of $ V $. Prove each statement.  If $ h(vec(β)_i)=0 $ for each basis vector then $ h $ is the zero map. If $ h(vec(β)_i)=vec(β)_i $ for each basis vector then $ h $ is the identity map. If there is a scalar $ r $ such that $ h(vec(β)_i)=r·vec(β)_i $ for each basis vector then $ h(vec(v))=r·vec(v) $ for all vectors in $V$.    Let $ vec(v) in V $ be represented with respect to the basis as $ vec(v)=c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n $. Then $ h(vec(v))=h(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n) =c_1h(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nh(vec(β)_n) =c_1·0+...+c_n·0 =0 $. This argument is similar to the prior one. Let $ vec(v) in V $ be represented with respect to the basis as $ vec(v)=c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n $. Then $ h(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n) =c_1h(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nh(vec(β)_n) =c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n =vec(v) $. As above, only $ c_1h(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nh(vec(β)_n) =c_1rvec(β)_1+...+c_nrvec(β)_n =r(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n) =rvec(v) $.    Consider the vector space $ ℝ^+ $ where vector addition and scalar multiplication are not the ones inherited from $ ℝ$ but rather are these: $ a+b $ is the product of $ a $ and $ b $, and $ r· a $ is the $ r $-th power of $ a $. (This was shown to be a vector space in an earlier exercise.) Verify that the natural logarithm map $ ln: ℝ^+ → ℝ $ is a homomorphism between these two spaces. Is it an isomorphism?  That it is a homomorphism follows from the familiar rules that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms $ln(ab)=ln(a)+ln(b)$ and that the logarithm of a power is the multiple of the logarithm $ln(a^r)=rln(a)$. This map is an isomorphism because it has an inverse, namely, the exponential map, so it is a correspondence, and therefore it is an isomorphism.   Consider this transformation of $ ℝ^2 $. $ [x y] ↦ [x/2 y/3] $ Find the image under this map of this ellipse. $ {[x y] such that (x^2/4)+(y^2/9)=1} $  Where $ x̂=x/2 $ and $ ŷ=y/3 $, the image set is $ {[ hat{{x] hat{{y}} such that frac( (2x̂)^2){ 4} +frac( (3ŷ)^2){ 9}=1} ={[ hat{{x] hat{{y}} such that x̂^2+ŷ^2=1} $ the unit circle in the $ x̂ŷ $-plane.   Imagine a rope wound around the earth's equator so that it fits snugly (suppose that the earth is a sphere). How much extra rope must we add to raise the circle to a constant six feet off the ground?  The circumference function $r↦ 2π r$ is linear. Thus we have $2π· (r_{earth}+6)- 2π· (r_{earth})=12π$. Observe that it takes the same amount of extra rope to raise the circle from tightly wound around a basketball to six feet above that basketball as it does to raise it from tightly wound around the earth to six feet above the earth.   Verify that this map $ h: ℝ^3 → ℝ $ $ [x y z]↦ [x y z]dot product of [3 -1 -1]=3x-y-z $ is linear. Generalize.  Verifying that it is linear is routine. $ h(c_1· [x_1 y_1 z_1] +c_2· [x_2 y_2 z_2]) =h([c_1x_1+c_2x_2 c_1y_1+c_2y_2 c_1z_1+c_2z_2]) =3(c_1x_1+c_2x_2)-(c_1y_1+c_2y_2)-(c_1z_1+c_2z_2) =c_1· (3x_1-y_1-z_1)+c_2· (3x_2-y_2-z_2) =c_1· h([x_1 y_1 z_1]) +c_2· h([x_2 y_2 z_2]) $ The natural guess at a generalization is that for any fixed $ vec(k) in ℝ^3 $ the map $ vec(v)↦vec(v)dot product of vec(k) $ is linear. This statement is true. It follows from properties of the dot product we have seen earlier: $ (vec(v)+vec(u))dot product of vec(k)=vec(v)dot product of vec(k)+ vec(u)dot product of vec(k) $ and $ (rvec(v))dot product of vec(k)=r(vec(v)dot product of vec(k)) $. (The natural guess at a generalization of this generalization, that the map from $ ℝ^n $ to $ ℝ $ whose action consists of taking the dot product of its argument with a fixed vector $ vec(k) in ℝ^n $ is linear, is also true.)   Show that every homomorphism from $ ℝ^1 $ to $ ℝ^1 $ acts via multiplication by a scalar. Conclude that every nontrivial linear transformation of $ ℝ^1 $ is an isomorphism. Is that true for transformations of $ ℝ^2 $? $ ℝ^n $?  Let $ h: ℝ^1 → ℝ^1 $ be linear. A linear map is determined by its action on a basis, so fix the basis $ 1 $ for $ ℝ^1 $. For any $ r in ℝ^1 $ we have that $ h(r)=h(r· 1)=r· h(1) $ and so $ h $ acts on any argument $r$ by multiplying it by the constant $ h(1) $. If $ h(1) $ is not zero then the map is a correspondence- its inverse is division by $ h(1) $- so any nontrivial transformation of $ ℝ^1$ is an isomorphism.  This projection map is an example that shows that not every transformation of $ ℝ^n $ acts via multiplication by a constant when $ n>1 $, including when $n=2$. $ [x_1 x_2 ... x_n] ↦[x_1 0 ... 0] $     Show that for any scalars $ a_{1,1},..., a_{m,n} $ this map $ h: ℝ^n → ℝ^m $ is a homomorphism. $ [x_1 ... x_n] ↦ [a_{1,1]x_1+...+a_{1,n}x_n ... a_{m,1}x_1+·s+a_{m,n}x_n} $ Show that for each $i$, the $ i $-th derivative operator $d^i/dx^i$ is a linear transformation of $ polyspace(_n) $. Conclude that for any scalars $ c_k,..., c_0 $ this map is a linear transformation of that space. $ f↦ (d^k/dx^k)f+c_{k-1}frac{d^{k-1}}{dx^{k-1}}f +...+ c_1(d/dx)f+c_0f $    Where $ c $ and $ d $ are scalars, we have this. $ h(c· [x_1 ... x_n] +d· [y_1 ... y_n]) $ =h([cx_1+dy_1 ... cx_n+dy_n]) =[a_{1,1](cx_1+dy_1)+...+a_{1,n}(cx_n+dy_n) ... a_{m,1}(cx_1+dy_1)+...+a_{m,n}(cx_n+dy_n)} =c·[a_{1,1]x_1+...+a_{1,n}x_n ... a_{m,1}x_1+...+a_{m,n}x_n} +d·[a_{1,1]y_1+...+a_{1,n}y_n ... a_{m,1}y_1+...+a_{m,n}y_n} =c· h([x_1 ... x_n]) +d· h([y_1 ... y_n]) $ $ Each power $i$ of the derivative operator is linear because of these rules familiar from calculus. $ (d^i/dx^i)(f(x)+g(x))=(d^i/dx^i)f(x) +(d^i/dx^i)g(x)  (d^i/dx^i)r· f(x)=r·(d^i/dx^i)f(x) $ Thus the given map is a linear transformation of $ polyspace(_n) $ because any linear combination of linear maps is also a linear map.    shows that a sum of linear functions is linear and that a scalar multiple of a linear function is linear. Show also that a composition of linear functions is linear.  (This argument has already appeared, as part of the proof that isomorphism is an equivalence.) Let $f: U → V$ and $g: V → W$ be linear. The composition preserves linear combinations $ ∘{g}{f}(c_1vec(u)_1+c_2vec(u)_2) =g(f(c_1vec(u)_1+c_2vec(u)_2)) =g(c_1f(vec(u)_1)+c_2f(vec(u)_2)) =c_1· g(f(vec(u)_1))+c_2· g(f(vec(u)_2)) =c_1· ∘{g}{f}(vec(u)_1) +c_2· ∘{g}{f}(vec(u)_2) $ where $vec(u)_1,vec(u)_2 in U$ and scalars $c_1,c_2$   Where $ f: V → W $ is linear, suppose that $ f(vec(v)_1)=vec(w)_1 $, ..., $ f(vec(v)_n)=vec(w)_n $ for some vectors $ vec(w)_1 $, ..., $ vec(w)_n $ from $ W $.  If the set of $ vec(w) $'s is independent, must the set of $ vec(v) $'s also be independent? If the set of $ vec(v) $'s is independent, must the set of $ vec(w) $'s also be independent? If the set of $ vec(w) $'s spans $ W $, must the set of $ vec(v) $'s span $ V $? If the set of $ vec(v) $'s spans $ V $, must the set of $ vec(w) $'s span $ W $?    Yes. The set of $vec(w)$'s cannot be linearly independent if the set of $vec(v)$'s is linearly dependent because any nontrivial relationship in the domain $ 0_V=c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_nvec(v)_n $ would give a nontrivial relationship in the range $ f(0_V)=0_W=f(c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_nvec(v)_n) =c_1f(vec(v)_1)+...+c_nf(vec(v)_n) =c_1vec(w)+...+c_nvec(w)_n $. Not necessarily. For instance, the transformation of $ ℝ^2 $ given by $ [x y] ↦ [x+y x+y] $ sends this linearly independent set in the domain to a linearly dependent image. $ {vec{{v}_1,vec{{v}_2}={[1 0],[1 1]} ↦ {[1 1],[2 2]}={vec{{w}_1,vec{{w}_2} $ Not necessarily. An example is the projection map $ π: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2 $ $ [x y z]↦[x y] $ and this set that does not span the domain but maps to a set that does span the codomain. $ {[1 0 0],[0 1 0]} π ↓{[1 0],[0 1]} $ Not necessarily. For instance, the injection map $ι: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3$ sends the standard basis $stdbasis(_2)$ for the domain to a set that does not span the codomain. (Remark. However, the set of $vec(w)$'s does span the range. A proof is easy.)    Generalize by proving that for every appropriate domain and codomain the matrix transpose map is linear. What are the appropriate domains and codomains?  Recall that the entry in row~$i$ and column~$j$ of the transpose of $M$ is the entry $m_{j,i}$ from row~$j$ and column~$i$ of $M$. Now, the check is routine. Start with the transpose of the combination. $ trans{[r·([ ... ·s a_{i,j} ·s ... ]) +s·([ ... ·s b_{i,j} ·s ... ])]} $ Combine and take the transpose. $ =trans{([ ... ·s ra_{i,j}+sb_{i,j} ·s ... ])} =([ ... ·s ra_{j,i}+sb_{j,i} ·s ... ]) $ Then bring out the scalars, and un-transpose. $ =r·([ ... ·s a_{j,i} ·s ... ]) +s·([ ... ·s b_{j,i} ·s ... ]) =r·trans{([ ... ·s a_{j,i} ·s ... ]) } +s·trans{([ ... ·s b_{j,i} ·s ... ]) } $ The domain is $ matspace(_){N by M} $ while the codomain is $ matspace(_){N by M} $.    Where $ vec(u),vec(v) in ℝ^n $, by definition the line segment connecting them is the set $ l={t·vec{{u}+(1-t)·vec{{v} such that t in [0..1]} $. Show that the image, under a homomorphism $h$, of the segment between $vec(u)$ and $vec(v)$ is the segment between $h(vec(u))$ and $h(vec(v))$. A subset of $ ℝ^n $ is convex if, for any two points in that set, the line segment joining them lies entirely in that set. (The inside of a sphere is convex while the skin of a sphere is not.) Prove that linear maps from $ ℝ^n $ to $ ℝ^m $ preserve the property of set convexity.    For any homomorphism $ h: ℝ^n → ℝ^m $ we have $ h(l) ={h(t·vec{{u}+(1-t)·vec{{v}) such that t in [0..1]} ={t· h(vec{{u})+(1-t)· h(vec{{v}) such that t in [0..1]} $ which is the line segment from $h(vec(u))$ to $h(vec(v))$. We must show that if a subset of the domain is convex then its image, as a subset of the range, is also convex. Suppose that $ C⊆ ℝ^n $ is convex and consider its image $h(C)$. To show $h(C)$ is convex we must show that for any two of its members, $vec(d)_1$ and $vec(d)_2$, the line segment connecting them $ l={t·vec{{d}_1+(1-t)·vec{{d}_2 such that t in [0..1]} $ is a subset of $h(C)$.  Fix any member $t̂·vec(d)_1+(1-t̂)·vec(d)_2$ of that line segment. Because the endpoints of $l$ are in the image of $C$, there are members of $C$ that map to them, say $h(vec(_1))=vec(d)_1$ and $h(vec(_2))=vec(d)_2$. Now, where $t̂$ is the scalar that we fixed in the first sentence of this paragraph, observe that $h(t̂·vec(_1+)(1-t̂)·vec(_2)) =t̂· h(vec(_1))+(1-t̂)· h(vec(_2)) =t̂·vec(d)_1+(1-t̂)·vec(d)_2$ Thus, any member of $l$ is a member of $h(C)$, and so $h(C)$ is convex.    Let $ h: ℝ^n → ℝ^m $ be a homomorphism.  Show that the image under $ h $ of a line in $ ℝ^n $ is a (possibly degenerate) line in $ ℝ^m $. What happens to a $ k $-dimensional linear surface?    For $ vec(v)_0,vec(v)_1 in ℝ^n $, the line through $ vec(v)_0 $ with direction $ vec(v)_1 $ is the set ${vec{{v}_0+t· vec{{v}_1 such that t in ℝ}$. The image under $h$ of that line ${h(vec{{v}_0+t· vec{{v}_1) such that t in ℝ} ={h(vec{{v}_0)+t· h(vec{{v}_1) such that t in ℝ}$ is the line through $h(vec(v)_0)$ with direction $h(vec(v)_1)$. If $ h(vec(v)_1) $ is the zero vector then this line is degenerate. A $ k $-dimensional linear surface in $ ℝ^n $ maps to a $ k $-dimensional linear surface in $ ℝ^m $ (possibly it is degenerate). The proof is just like that the one for the line.    Prove that the restriction of a homomorphism to a subspace of its domain is another homomorphism.  Suppose that $ h: V → W $ is a homomorphism and suppose that $ S $ is a subspace of $ V $. Consider the map $ map(ĥ){S}{W} $ defined by $ ĥ(vec(s))=h(vec(s)) $. (The only difference between $ĥ$ and $h$ is the difference in domain.) Then this new map is linear: $ ĥ(c_1·vec(s)_1+c_2·vec(s)_2)= h(c_1vec(s)_1+c_2vec(s)_2)=c_1h(vec(s)_1)+c_2h(vec(s)_2)= c_1·ĥ(vec(s)_1)+c_2·ĥ(vec(s)_2) $.   Assume that $ h: V → W $ is linear.  Show that the range space of this map $ {h(vec{{v}) such that vec{{v} in V} $ is a subspace of the codomain $ W $. Show that the null space of this map $ {vec{{v} in V such that h(vec{{v})=0_W} $ is a subspace of the domain $ V $. Show that if $ U $ is a subspace of the domain $ V $ then its image $ {h(vec{{u}) such that vec{{u} in U} $ is a subspace of the codomain $ W $. This generalizes the first item. Generalize the second item.  This will appear as a lemma in the next subsection.  The range is nonempty because $ V $ is nonempty. To finish we need to show that it is closed under combinations. A combination of range vectors has the form, where $ vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_n in V $, $ c_1· h(vec(v)_1)+...+c_n· h(vec(v)_n) = h(c_1vec(v)_1)+...+h(c_nvec(v)_n) = h(c_1· vec(v)_1+...+c_n· vec(v)_n), $ which is itself in the range as $ c_1· vec(v)_1+...+c_n· vec(v)_n $ is a member of domain $ V $. Therefore the range is a subspace. The null space is nonempty since it contains $0_V$, as $ 0_V $ maps to $ 0_W $. It is closed under linear combinations because, where $ vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_n in V $ are elements of the inverse image $ {vec{{v} in V such that h(vec{{v})=0_W} $, for $ c_1,...,c_n in ℝ $ $ 0_W=c_1· h(vec(v)_1)+...+c_n· h(vec(v)_n) =h(c_1· vec(v)_1+...+c_n· vec(v)_n) $ and so $ c_1· vec(v)_1+...+c_n· vec(v)_n $ is also in the inverse image of $ 0_W $. This image of $ U $ nonempty because $ U $ is nonempty. For closure under combinations, where $ vec(u)_1,...,vec(u)_n in U $, $ c_1· h(vec(u)_1)+...+c_n· h(vec(u)_n) = h(c_1· vec(u)_1)+...+h(c_n· vec(u)_n) = h(c_1· vec(u)_1+...+c_n· vec(u)_n) $ which is itself in $ h(U) $ as $ c_1· vec(u)_1+...+c_n· vec(u)_n $ is in $ U $. Thus this set is a subspace. The natural generalization is that the inverse image of a subspace of is a subspace.  Suppose that $ X $ is a subspace of $ W $. Note that $ 0_W in X $ so that the set $ {vec{{v} in V such that h(vec{{v}) in X} $ is not empty. To show that this set is closed under combinations, let $ vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_n $ be elements of $ V $ such that $ h(vec(v)_1)=vec(x)_1 $, ..., $ h(vec(v)_n)=vec(x)_n $ and note that $ h(c_1· vec(v)_1+...+c_n· vec(v)_n) =c_1· h(vec(v)_1)+...+c_n· h(vec(v)_n) =c_1· vec(x)_1+...+c_n· vec(x)_n $ so a linear combination of elements of $ h^{-1}(X) $ is also in $ h^{-1}(X) $.    Consider the set of isomorphisms from a vector space to itself. Is this a subspace of the space $ linmaps(V){V} $ of homomorphisms from the space to itself?  No; the set of isomorphisms does not contain the zero map (unless the space is trivial).   Does need that $sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n}$ is a basis? That is, can we still get a well-defined and unique homomorphism if we drop either the condition that the set of $vec(β)$'s be linearly independent, or the condition that it span the domain?  If $sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n}$ doesn't span the space then the map needn't be unique. For instance, if we try to define a map from $ ℝ^2$ to itself by specifying only that $vec(e)_1$ maps to itself, then there is more than one homomorphism possible; both the identity map and the projection map onto the first component fit this condition.  If we drop the condition that $sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n}$ is linearly independent then we risk an inconsistent specification (i.e, there could be no such map). An example is if we consider $sequence{vec(e)_2,vec(e)_1,2vec(e)_1}$, and try to define a map from $ ℝ^2$ to itself that sends $vec(e)_2$ to itself, and sends both $vec(e)_1$ and $2vec(e)_1$ to $vec(e)_1$. No homomorphism can satisfy these three conditions.   Let $ V $ be a vector space and assume that the maps $ f_1,f_2: V → ℝ^1 $ are linear.  Define a map $ F: V → ℝ^2 $ whose component functions are the given linear ones. $ vec(v)↦[f_1( vec{v]) f_2(vec(v))} $ Show that $ F $ is linear. Does the converse hold- is any linear map from $ V $ to $ ℝ^2 $ made up of two linear component maps to $ ℝ^1 $? Generalize.    Briefly, the check of linearity is this. $ F(r_1· vec(v)_1+r_2· vec(v)_2) =[f_1(r_1 vec{v]_1+r_2vec(v)_2) f_2(r_1vec(v)_1+r_2vec(v)_2)} =r_1[f_1( vec{v]_1) f_2(vec(v)_1)} +r_2[f_1( vec{v]_2) f_2(vec(v)_2)} =r_1· F(vec(v)_1)+r_2· F(vec(v)_2) $ Yes. Let $ π_1: ℝ^2 → ℝ^1 $ and $ π_2: ℝ^2 → ℝ^1 $ be the projections $ [x y]π_1 ↓ x and [x y]π_2 ↓ y $ onto the two axes. Now, where $ f_1(vec(v))=π_1(F(vec(v))) $ and $ f_2(vec(v))=π_2(F(vec(v))) $ we have the desired component functions. $ F(vec(v))= [f_1( vec{v]) f_2(vec(v))} $ They are linear because they are the composition of linear functions, and the fact that the composition of linear functions is linear was part of the proof that isomorphism is an equivalence relation (alternatively, the check that they are linear is straightforward). In general, a map from a vector space $ V $ to an $ ℝ^n $ is linear if and only if each of the component functions is linear. The verification is as in the prior item.                    Isomorphisms and homomorphisms both preserve structure. The difference is that homomorphisms have fewer restrictions, since they needn't be onto and needn't be one-to-one. We will examine what can happen with homomorphisms that cannot happen with isomorphisms.  First consider the fact that homomorphisms need not be onto. Of course, each function is onto some set, namely its range. For example, the injection map $ ι: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3 $ $ [x y] ↦ [x y 0] $ is a homomorphism, and is not onto $ ℝ^3$. But it is onto the $xy$-plane.    Under a homomorphism, the image of any subspace of the domain is a subspace of the codomain. In particular, the image of the entire space, the range of the homomorphism, is a subspace of the codomain.      Let $h: V → W$ be linear and let $S$ be a subspace of the domain $V$. The image $h(S)$ is a subset of the codomain $W$, which is nonempty because $S$ is nonempty. Thus, to show that $h(S)$ is a subspace of $W$ we need only show that it is closed under linear combinations of two vectors. If $h(vec(s)_1)$ and $h(vec(s)_2)$ are members of $h(S)$ then $c_1· h(vec(s)_1)+c_2· h(vec(s)_2) = h(c_1· vec(s)_1)+h(c_2· vec(s)_2) = h(c_1· vec(s)_1+c_2· vec(s)_2)$ is also a member of $h(S)$ because it is the image of $ c_1· vec(s)_1+c_2· vec(s)_2 $ from $ S $.      The range space of a homomorphism $ h: V → W $ is $ h={h(vec{{v}) such that vec{{v} in V} $ sometimes denoted $ h(V) $. The dimension of the range space is the map's rank.    We shall soon see the connection between the rank of a map and the rank of a matrix.  For example For the derivative map $ d/dx: polyspace(_3) → polyspace(_3) $ given by $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 ↦ a_1+2a_2x+3a_3x^2 $ the range space $ d/dx $ is the set of quadratic polynomials $ {r+sx+tx^2 such that r,s,t in ℝ } $. Thus, this map's rank is~$ 3 $.   For example With this homomorphism $ map(h){M_{N by N}}{polyspace(_3)} $ $ ([ a b c d ]) ↦ (a+b+2d)+cx^2+cx^3 $ an image vector in the range can have any constant term, must have an $x$ coefficient of zero, and must have the same coefficient of $x^2$ as of $x^3$. That is, the range space is $ h={r+sx^2+sx^3 such that r,s in ℝ} $ and so the rank is~$ 2 $.   The prior result shows that, in passing from the definition of isomorphism to the more general definition of homomorphism, omitting the onto requirement doesn't make an essential difference. Any homomorphism is onto some space, namely its range.  However, omitting the one-to-one condition does make a difference. A homomorphism may have many elements of the domain that map to one element of the codomain. Below is a bean sketch of a many-to-one map between sets.spacefactor=1000 It shows three elements of the codomain that are each the image of many members of the domain. (Rather than picture lots of individual $↦$ arrows, each association of many inputs with one output shows only one such arrow.)     Recall that for any function $h: V → W$, the set of elements of $V$ that map to $ vec(w) in W $ is the inverse image  $h^{-1}(vec(w))={vec{{v} in V such that h(vec{{v})=vec{{w}}$. Above, the left side shows three inverse image sets.   For example Consider the projection $ π: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2 $ $ [x y z] π ↓ [x y] $ which is a homomorphism that is many-to-one. An inverse image set is a vertical line of vectors in the domain.    One example is this. $ π^{-1}([1 3])={[1 3 z] such that z in ℝ} $   For example This homomorphism $h: ℝ^2 → ℝ^1$ $ [x y] h ↓ x+y $ is also many-to-one. For a fixed $w in ℝ^1$ the inverse image $h^{-1}(w)$    is the set of plane vectors whose components add to $w$.             In generalizing from isomorphisms to homomorphisms by dropping the one-to-one condition we lose the property that, intuitively, the domain is ``the same'' as the range. We lose, that is, that the domain corresponds perfectly to the range. The examples below illustrate that what we retain is that a homomorphism describes how the domain is ``analogous to'' or ``like'' the range.  For example We think of $ ℝ^3$ as like $ ℝ^2$ except that vectors have an extra component. That is, we think of the vector with components $x$, $y$, and~$z$ as like the vector with components $x$ and~$y$. Defining the projection map $π$ makes precise which members of the domain we are thinking of as related to which members of the codomain.  To understanding how the preservation conditions in the definition of homomorphism show that the domain elements are like the codomain elements, start by picturing $ ℝ^2$ as the $xy$-plane inside of $ ℝ^3$ (the $xy$~plane inside of $ ℝ^3$ is a set of three-tall vectors with a third component of zero and so does not precisely equal the set of two-tall vectors~$ ℝ^2$, but this embedding makes the picture much clearer). The preservation of addition property says that vectors in $ ℝ^3 $ act like their shadows in the plane.     [1.5ex] { $[x_1 y_1 z_1]$ above $[x_1 y_1]$} { plus } { $[x_2 y_2 z_2]$ above $[x_2 y_2]$} { equals } { $[x_1+y_1 y_1+y_2 z_1+z_2]$ above $[x_1+x_2 y_1+y_2]$}    Thinking of $π(vec(v))$ as the ``shadow'' of $vec(v)$ in the plane gives this restatement: the sum of the shadows $π(vec(v)_1)+π(vec(v)_2)$ equals the shadow of the sum $π(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)$. Preservation of scalar multiplication is similar.  Drawing the codomain $ ℝ^2$ on the right gives a picture that is uglier but is more faithful to the bean sketch above.    Again, the domain vectors that map to $vec(w)_1$ lie in a vertical line; one is drawn, in gray. Call any member of this inverse image $π^{-1}(vec(w)_1)$ a ``$vec(w)_1$~vector.'' Similarly, there is a vertical line of ``$vec(w)_2$~vectors'' and a vertical line of ``$vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2$~vectors.'' Now, saying that $π$ is a homomorphism is recognizing that if $π(vec(v)_1)=vec(w)_1$ and $π(vec(v)_2)=vec(w)_2$ then $π(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)=π(vec(v)_1)+π(vec(v)_2) =vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2$. That is, the classes add:~any $ vec(w)_1 $~vector plus any $ vec(w)_2 $~vector equals a $ vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2 $~vector. Scalar multiplication is similar.  So although $ ℝ^3$ and $ ℝ^2$ are not isomorphic $π$ describes a way in which they are alike:~vectors in $ ℝ^3$ add as do the associated vectors in $ ℝ^2$- vectors add as their shadows add.   For example A homomorphism can express an analogy between spaces that is more subtle than the prior one. For the map from $ [x y] h ↓ x+y $ fix two numbers in the range $w_1, w_2 in ℝ$. A $vec(v)_1$ that maps to $w_1$ has components that add to $w_1$, so the inverse image $h^{-1}(w_1)$ is the set of vectors with endpoint on the diagonal line $x+y=w_1$. Think of these as ``$w_1$ vectors.'' Similarly we have ``$w_2$ vectors'' and ``$w_1+w_2$ vectors.'' The addition preservation property says this.     [1.5ex] { a ``$w_1$ vector''} { plus} { a ``$w_2$ vector''} { equals} { a ``$w_1+w_2$ vector''}   Restated, if we add a $w_1$~vector to a $w_2$~vector then $h$ maps the result to a $w_1+w_2$ vector. Briefly, the sum of the images is the image of the sum. Even more briefly, $ h(vec(v)_1)+h(vec(v)_2)=h(vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2) $.     For example The inverse images can be structures other than lines. For the linear map $ h: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2 $ $ [x y z] ↦ [x x] $ the inverse image sets are planes $x=0$, $x=1$, etc., perpendicular to the $ x $-axis.      We won't describe how every homomorphism that we will use is an analogy because the formal sense that we make of ``alike in that~...'' is `a homomorphism exists such that~...'. Nonetheless, the idea that a homomorphism between two spaces expresses how the domain's vectors fall into classes that act like the range's vectors is a good way to view homomorphisms.  Another reason that we won't treat all of the homomorphisms that we see as above is that many vector spaces are hard to draw, e.g., a space of polynomials. But there is nothing wrong with leveraging spaces that we can draw: from the three examples , , and~ we draw two insights.  The first insight is that in all three examples the inverse image of the range's zero vector is a line or plane through the origin. It is therefore a subspace of the domain.    For any homomorphism the inverse image of a subspace of the range is a subspace of the domain. In particular, the inverse image of the trivial subspace of the range is a subspace of the domain.    (The examples above consider inverse images of single vectors but this result is about inverse images of sets $h^{-1}(S)={vec{{v} in V such that h(vec{{v}) in S}$. We use the same term for both by taking the inverse image of a single element $h^{-1}(vec(w))$ to be the inverse image of the one-element set $h^{-1}({vec{{w}})$.)    Let $h: V → W$ be a homomorphism and let $S$ be a subspace of the range space of $h$. Consider the inverse image of $S$. It is nonempty because it contains $0_V$, since $ h(0_V)=0_W $ and $ 0_W $ is an element of $S$ as $S$ is a subspace. To finish we show that $h^{-1}(S)$ is closed under linear combinations. Let $ vec(v)_1 $ and $ vec(v)_2 $ be two of its elements, so that $h(vec(v)_1)$ and $h(vec(v)_2)$ are elements of $S$. Then $c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2$ is an element of the inverse image $h^{-1}(S)$ because $h(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2) =c_1h(vec(v)_1)+c_2h(vec(v)_2)$ is a member of $S$.      The null space or kernel of a linear map $ h: V → W $ is the inverse image of $0_W$. $ νllspace{h}=h^{-1}(0_W)={vec{{v} in V such that h(vec{{v})=0_W} $ The dimension of the null space is the map's nullity .        For example The map from has this null space $ νllspace{d/dx}={a_0+0x+0x^2+0x^3 such that a_0 in ℝ} $ so its nullity is $1$.   For example The map from has this null space, and nullity $2$. $ νllspace{h}={([ a b 0 -(a+b)/2 ]) such that a,b in ℝ} $   Now for the second insight from the above examples. In each of the vertical lines squashes down to a single point- in passing from the domain to the range, $π$ takes all of these one-dimensional vertical lines and maps them to a point, leaving the range smaller than the domain by one dimension. Similarly, in the two-dimensional domain compresses to a one-dimensional range by breaking the domain into the diagonal lines and maps each of those to a single member of the range. Finally, in the domain breaks into planes which get squashed to a point and so the map starts with a three-dimensional domain but ends two smaller, with a one-dimensional range. (The codomain is two-dimensional but the range is one-dimensional and the dimension of the range is what matters.)     A linear map's rank plus its nullity equals the dimension of its domain.      Let $ h: V → W $ be linear and let $ B_N=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_k} $ be a basis for the null space. Expand that to a basis $ B_V=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_k, vec(β)_{k+1},...,vec(β)_n} $ for the entire domain, using Corollary~Two.III.. We shall show that $ B_R=sequence{ h(vec(β)_{k+1}),...,h(vec(β)_n)} $ is a basis for the range space. Then counting the size of the bases gives the result.    To see that $ B_R $ is linearly independent, consider $ 0_W=c_{k+1}h(vec(β)_{k+1})+...+c_nh(vec(β)_n) $. We have $ 0_W=h(c_{k+1}vec(β)_{k+1}+...+c_nvec(β)_n) $ and so $ c_{k+1}vec(β)_{k+1}+...+c_nvec(β)_n $ is in the null space of $h$. As $ B_N$ is a basis for the null space there are scalars $ c_1,...,c_k $ satisfying this relationship. $ c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_kvec(β)_k = c_{k+1}vec(β)_{k+1}+...+c_nvec(β)_n $ But this is an equation among members of $ B_V $, which is a basis for $ V $, so each $c_i$ equals $0$. Therefore $ B_R $ is linearly independent.    To show that $ B_R $ spans the range space consider a member of the range space $ h(vec(v)) $. Express $ vec(v) $ as a linear combination $vec(v)=c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n$ of members of $ B_V $. This gives $h(vec(v))=h(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n) =c_1h(vec(β)_1)+...+c_kh(vec(β)_k) +c_{k+1}h(vec(β)_{k+1})+...+c_nh(vec(β)_n)$ and since $vec(β)_1$, ..., $vec(β)_k$ are in the null space, we have that $h(vec(v))=0+...+0 +c_{k+1}h(vec(β)_{k+1})+...+c_nh(vec(β)_n)$. Thus, $h(vec(v))$ is a linear combination of members of $ B_R $, and so $B_R$ spans the range space.    For example Where $ h: ℝ^3 → ℝ^4 $ is $ [x y z] h ↓ [x 0 y 0] $ the range space and null space are $ h= {[a 0 b 0] such that a,b in ℝ } and νllspace{h}= {[0 0 z] such that z in ℝ } $ and so the rank of $h$ is $2$ while the nullity is $1$.   For example If $ t: ℝ → ℝ $ is the linear transformation $ x↦ -4x, $ then the range is $ t= ℝ $. The rank is $1$ and the nullity is $0$.     The rank of a linear map is less than or equal to the dimension of the domain. Equality holds if and only if the nullity of the map is $0$.   We know that an isomorphism exists between two spaces if and only if the dimension of the range equals the dimension of the domain. We have now seen that for a homomorphism to exist a necessary condition is that the dimension of the range must be less than or equal to the dimension of the domain. For instance, there is no homomorphism from $ ℝ^2 $ onto $ ℝ^3 $. There are many homomorphisms from $ ℝ^2 $ into $ ℝ^3 $, but none onto.  The range space of a linear map can be of dimension strictly less than the dimension of the domain and so linearly independent sets in the domain may map to linearly dependent sets in the range. ('s derivative transformation on $polyspace(_3)$ has a domain of dimension~$4$ but a range of dimension~$3$ and the derivative sends ${1,x,x^2,x^3}$ to ${0,1,2x,3x^2}$). That is, under a homomorphism independence may be lost. In contrast, dependence stays.    Under a linear map, the image of a linearly dependent set is linearly dependent.      Suppose that $ c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_nvec(v)_n=0_V $ with some $c_i$ nonzero. Apply $h$ to both sides: $ h(c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_nvec(v)_n)=c_1h(vec(v)_1)+...+c_nh(vec(v)_n) $ and $ h(0_V)=0_W $. Thus we have $c_1h(vec(v)_1)+...+c_nh(vec(v)_n)=0_W$ with some $c_i$ nonzero.    When is independence not lost? The obvious sufficient condition is when the homomorphism is an isomorphism. This condition is also necessary; see . We will finish this subsection comparing homomorphisms with isomorphisms by observing that a one-to-one homomorphism is an isomorphism from its domain onto its range.            For example This one-to-one homomorphism $ ι: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3 $ $ [x y] ι ↓ [x y 0] $ gives a correspondence between $ ℝ^2 $ and the $ xy $-plane subset of $ ℝ^3 $.       Where $ V $ is an $ n $-dimensional vector space, these are equivalent statements about a linear map $ h: V → W $.  $ h $ is one-to-one $ h $ has an inverse from its range to its domain that is a linear map $ νllspace{h}={0} $, that is, $ νllity(h)=0 $ $ rank(h)=n $ if $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ is a basis for $ V $ then $ sequence{h(vec(β)_1),...,h(vec(β)_n)} $ is a basis for $ h $       We will first show that $ (1) Longleftrightarrow(2) $. We will then show that $ (1)⇒ (3)⇒ (4)⇒ (5)⇒ (2) $.    For $ (1) --> (2) $, suppose that the linear map $h$ is one-to-one, and therefore has an inverse $map{h^{-1}}{h}{V}$. The domain of that inverse is the range of $h$ and thus a linear combination of two members of it has the form $c_1h(vec(v)_1)+c_2h(vec(v)_2)$. On that combination, the inverse $ h^{-1} $ gives this. $ h^{-1}(c_1h(vec(v)_1)+c_2h(vec(v)_2)) =h^{-1}(h(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2)) =∘{h^{-1}}{h}(c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2) =c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2   =c_1· h^{-1}(h(vec(v)_1))+c_2· h^{-1}(h(vec(v)_2)) $ Thus if a linear map has an inverse then the inverse must be linear. But this also gives the $ (2) --> (1) $ implication, because the inverse itself must be one-to-one.    Of the remaining implications, $ (1)⇒ (3) $ holds because any homomorphism maps $ 0_V $ to $ 0_W $, but a one-to-one map sends at most one member of $ V $ to $ 0_W $.  Next, $ (3) ⇒ (4) $ is true since rank plus nullity equals the dimension of the domain.    For $ (4) ⇒ (5) $, to show that $ sequence{h(vec(β)_1),...,h(vec(β)_n)} $ is a basis for the range space we need only show that it is a spanning set, because by assumption the range has dimension $n$. Consider $h(vec(v)) inh$. Expressing $vec(v)$ as a linear combination of basis elements produces $ h(vec(v))=h(Linear combination of c{vec(β)}) $, which gives that $ h(vec(v))=c_1h(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nh(vec(β)_n) $, as desired.    Finally, for the $ (5)⇒ (2) $ implication, assume that $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ is a basis for $ V $ so that $ sequence{h(vec(β)_1),...,h(vec(β)_n)} $ is a basis for $ h $. Then every $ vec(w) inh $ has the unique representation $ vec(w)=c_1h(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nh(vec(β)_n) $. Define a map from $ h $ to $V$ by $ vec(w) ↦ Linear combination of c{vec(β)} $ (uniqueness of the representation makes this well-defined). Checking that it is linear and that it is the inverse of $h$ are easy.    We have seen that a linear map expresses how the structure of the domain is like that of the range. We can think of such a map as organizing the domain space into inverse images of points in the range. In the special case that the map is one-to-one, each inverse image is a single point and the map is an isomorphism between the domain and the range.     Let $ h: polyspace(_3) → polyspace(_4) $ be given by $ p(x)↦ x· p(x) $. Which of these are in the null space? Which are in the range space?  $ x^3 $ $ 0 $ $ 7 $ $ 12x-0.5x^3 $ $ 1+3x^2-x^3 $   First, to answer whether a polynomial is in the null space, we have to consider it as a member of the domain $polyspace(_3)$. To answer whether it is in the range space, we consider it as a member of the codomain $polyspace(_4)$. That is, for $p(x)=x^4$, the question of whether it is in the range space is sensible but the question of whether it is in the null space is not because it is not even in the domain.  The polynomial $x^3 inpolyspace(_3)$ is not in the null space because $h(x^3)=x^4$ is not the zero polynomial in $polyspace(_4)$. The polynomial $x^3 inpolyspace(_4)$ is in the range space because $x^2 inpolyspace(_3)$ is mapped by $h$ to $x^3$. The answer to both questions is, ``Yes, because $h(0)=0$.'' The polynomial $0 inpolyspace(_3)$ is in the null space because it is mapped by $h$ to the zero polynomial in $polyspace(_4)$. The polynomial $0 inpolyspace(_4)$ is in the range space because it is the image, under $h$, of $0 inpolyspace(_3)$. The polynomial $7 inpolyspace(_3)$ is not in the null space because $h(7)=7x$ is not the zero polynomial in $polyspace(_4)$. The polynomial $7 inpolyspace(_4)$ is not in the range space because there is no member of the domain that when multiplied by $x$ gives the constant polynomial $p(x)=7$. The polynomial $12x-0.5x^3 inpolyspace(_3)$ is not in the null space because $h(12x-0.5x^3)=12x^2-0.5x^4$. The polynomial $12x-0.5x^3 inpolyspace(_4)$ is in the range space because it is the image of $12-0.5x^2$. The polynomial $1+3x^2-x^3 inpolyspace(_3)$ is not in the null space because $h(1+3x^2-x^3)=x+3x^3-x^4$. The polynomial $1+3x^2-x^3 inpolyspace(_4)$ is not in the range space because of the constant term.   Find the range space and the rank of each homomorphism.   $h: polyspace(_3) → ℝ^2$ given by $ ax^2+bx+c↦ [a+b a+c] $ $f: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3$ given by $ [x y]↦[0 x-y 3y] $     The range of $h$ is all of the codomain~$ ℝ^2$ because given $ [x y] in ℝ^2 $ it is the image under~$h$ of the domain vector $0x^2+bx+c$. So the rank of~$h$ is~$2$.  The range is the $yz$~plane. Any $ [0 a b] $ is the image under~$f$ of this domain vector. $ [a+b/3 b/3] $ So the rank of the map is~$2$.    Find the range space and rank of each map.  $ h: ℝ^2 → polyspace(_3) $ given by $ [a b]↦ a+ax+ax^2 $ $ map(h){matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ} $ given by $ ([ a b c d ]) ↦ a+d $ $ map(h){matspace(_){N by N}}{polyspace(_2)} $ given by $ ([ a b c d ]) ↦ a+b+c+dx^2 $ the zero map $ Z: ℝ^3 → ℝ^4 $    The range space is $ h ={a+ax+ax^2 inpolyspace(_3) such that a,b in ℝ} ={a·(1+x+x^2) such that a in ℝ} $ and so the rank is one. The range space $ h= {a+d such that a,b,c,d in ℝ} $ is all of $ ℝ$ (we can get any real number by taking $d$ to be $0$ and taking $a$ to be the desired number). Thus, the rank is one. The range space is $h={r+sx^2 such that r,s in ℝ}$. The rank is two. The range space is the trivial subspace of $ ℝ^4 $ so the rank is zero.    For each linear map in the prior exercise, find the null space and nullity.   The null space is $ νllspace{h} ={[a b] in ℝ^2 such that a+ax+ax^2+0x^3=0+0x+0x^2+0x^3} ={[0 b] such that b in ℝ} $ and so the nullity is one. The null space is this. $ νllspace{h} ={([ a b c d ]) such that a+d=0} ={([ -d b c d ]) such that b,c,d in ℝ } $ Thus, the nullity is three. The range space is $h={r+sx^2 such that r,s in ℝ}$. Thus, the rank is two. The range space is the trivial subspace of $ ℝ^4 $ so the rank is zero.    Find the nullity of each map below.  $ h: ℝ^5 → ℝ^8 $ of rank five $ h: polyspace(_3) → polyspace(_3) $ of rank one $ h: ℝ^6 → ℝ^3 $, an onto map $ map(h){matspace(_){N by N}}{matspace(_){N by N}} $, onto   For each, use the result that the rank plus the nullity equals the dimension of the domain.  $0$ $3$ $3$ $0$    What is the null space of the differentiation transformation $ d/dx: polyspace(_n) → polyspace(_n) $? What is the null space of the second derivative, as a transformation of $ polyspace(_n) $? The $ k $-th derivative?  Because $ (d/dx)(a_0+a_1x+·s+a_nx^n) =a_1+2a_2x+3a_3x^2+·s+na_nx^{n-1} $ we have this. $ νllspace{(d/dx)} ={a_0+·s+a_nx^n such that a_1+2a_2x+·s+na_nx^{{n-1} =0+0x+·s+0x^{n-1}} ={a_0+·s+a_nx^n such that $a_1=0$, and $a_2=0$, ..., $a_n=0$} ={a_0+0x+0x^2+·s+0x^n such that a_0 in ℝ} $ In the same way, $ νllspace{(d^k/dx^k)} ={a_0+a_1x+·s+a_nx^n such that a_0,...,a_{{k-1} in ℝ} $ for $ k≤ n $.   restates the first condition in the definition of homomorphism as `the shadow of a sum is the sum of the shadows'. Restate the second condition in the same style.  The shadow of a scalar multiple is the scalar multiple of the shadow.   For the homomorphism $ h: polyspace(_3) → polyspace(_3) $ given by $ h(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3)=a_0+(a_0+a_1)x+(a_2+a_3)x^3 $ find these.  $ νllspace{h} $ $ h^{-1}(2-x^3) $ $ h^{-1}(1+x^2) $    Setting $a_0+(a_0+a_1)x+(a_2+a_3)x^3=0+0x+0x^2+0x^3$ gives $a_0=0$ and $a_0+a_1=0$ and $a_2+a_3=0$, so the null space is $ {-a_3x^2+a_3x^3 such that a_3 in ℝ} $. Setting $a_0+(a_0+a_1)x+(a_2+a_3)x^3=2+0x+0x^2-x^3$ gives that $a_0=2$, and $a_1=-2$, and $a_2+a_3=-1$. Taking $a_3$ as a parameter, and renaming it $a_3=a$ gives this set description $ {2-2x+(-1-a)x^2+ax^3 such that a in ℝ} ={(2-2x-x^2)+a·(-x^2+x^3) such that a in ℝ} $. This set is empty because the range of $h$ includes only those polynomials with a $0x^2$ term.    For the map $ f: ℝ^2 → ℝ $ given by $ f([x y])=2x+y $ sketch these inverse image sets:~$ f^{-1}(-3) $, $ f^{-1}(0) $, and $ f^{-1}(1) $.  All inverse images are lines with slope $-2$.      Each of these transformations of $ polyspace(_3) $ is one-to-one. For each, find the inverse.  $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3↦ a_0+a_1x+2a_2x^2+3a_3x^3 $ $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3↦ a_0+a_2x+a_1x^2+a_3x^3 $ $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3↦ a_1+a_2x+a_3x^2+a_0x^3 $ $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3↦ a_0+(a_0+a_1)x+(a_0+a_1+a_2)x^2+(a_0+a_1+a_2+a_3)x^3 $   These are the inverses.  $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3↦ a_0+a_1x+(a_2/2)x^2+(a_3/3)x^3 $ $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3↦ a_0+a_2x+a_1x^2+a_3x^3 $ $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3↦ a_3+a_0x+a_1x^2+a_2x^3 $ $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3↦ a_0+(a_1-a_0)x+(a_2-a_1)x^2+(a_3-a_2)x^3 $  For instance, for the second one, the map given in the question sends $0+1x+2x^2+3x^3↦ 0+2x+1x^2+3x^3$ and then the inverse above sends $0+2x+1x^2+3x^3↦ 0+1x+2x^2+3x^3$. So this map is actually self-inverse.   Describe the null space and range space of a transformation given by $ vec(v)↦ 2vec(v) $.  For any vector space $V$, the null space $ {vec{{v} in V such that 2vec{{v}=0} $ is trivial, while the range space $ {vec{{w} in V such that $vec{w=2vec(v)$ for some $vec(v) in V$}} $ is all of $ V $, because every vector $vec(w)$ is twice some other vector, specifically, it is twice $(1/2)vec(w)$. (Thus, this transformation is actually an automorphism.)   List all pairs $ (rank(h),nullity(h)) $ that are possible for linear maps from $ ℝ^5$ to $ ℝ^3$.  Because the rank plus the nullity equals the dimension of the domain (here, five), and the rank is at most three, the possible pairs are:~$ (3,2) $, $ (2,3) $, $ (1,4) $, and~$ (0,5) $. Coming up with linear maps that show that each pair is indeed possible is easy.   Does the differentiation map $ d/dx: polyspace(_n) → polyspace(_n) $ have an inverse?  No (unless $ polyspace(_n) $ is trivial), because the two polynomials $ f_0(x)=0 $ and $ f_1(x)=1 $ have the same derivative; a map must be one-to-one to have an inverse.   Find the nullity of this map $ h: polyspace(_n) → ℝ $. $ a_0+a_1x+...+a_nx^n↦ int_{x=0}^{x=1}a_0+a_1x+...+a_nx^ndx $  The null space is this. $ {a_0+a_1x+...+a_nx^n such that a_0(1)+( a_1/ 2)(1^2) +... +( a_n/ n+1)(1^{n+1})=0} ={a_0+a_1x+...+a_nx^n such that a_0+(a_1/2)+...+(a_{n}/n+1)=0} $ Thus the nullity is $ n $.    Prove that a homomorphism is onto if and only if its rank equals the dimension of its codomain. Conclude that a homomorphism between vector spaces with the same dimension is one-to-one if and only if it is onto.    One direction is obvious:~if the homomorphism is onto then its range is the codomain and so its rank equals the dimension of its codomain. For the other direction assume that the map's rank equals the dimension of the codomain. Then the map's range is a subspace of the codomain, and has dimension equal to the dimension of the codomain. Therefore, the map's range must equal the codomain, and the map is onto. (The `therefore' is because there is a linearly independent subset of the range that is of size equal to the dimension of the codomain, but any such linearly independent subset of the codomain must be a basis for the codomain, and so the range equals the codomain.) By , a homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if its nullity is zero. Because rank plus nullity equals the dimension of the domain, it follows that a homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if its rank equals the dimension of its domain. But this domain and codomain have the same dimension, so the map is one-to-one if and only if it is onto.    Show that a linear map is one-to-one if and only if it preserves linear independence.  We are proving that $ h: V → W $ is one-to-one if and only if for every linearly independent subset $ S $ of $ V $ the subset $ h(S)={h(vec{{s}) such that vec{{s} in S} $ of $ W $ is linearly independent.  One half is easy- by , if $ h $ is not one-to-one then its null space is nontrivial, that is, it contains more than just the zero vector. So where $ vec(v) ≠0_V $ is in that null space, the singleton set $ {vec{{v}} $ is independent while its image $ {h(vec{{v})}={0_W} $ is not.  For the other half, assume that $ h $ is one-to-one and so by has a trivial null space. Then for any $ vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_n in V $, the relation $ 0_W= c_1· h(vec(v)_1)+...+c_n· h(vec(v)_n) =h(c_1· vec(v)_1+...+c_n· vec(v)_n) $ implies the relation $ c_1· vec(v)_1+...+c_n· vec(v)_n=0_V $. Hence, if a subset of $ V $ is independent then so is its image in $ W $.  Remark. The statement is that a linear map is one-to-one if and only if it preserves independence for all sets (that is, if a set is independent then its image is also independent). A map that is not one-to-one may well preserve some independent sets. One example is this map from $ ℝ^3$ to $ ℝ^2$. $ [x y z]↦[x+y+z 0] $ Linear independence is preserved for this set $ {[1 0 0]}↦{[1 0]} $ and (in a somewhat more tricky example) also for this set $ {[1 0 0],[0 1 0]} ↦{[1 0]} $ (recall that in a set, repeated elements do not appear twice). However, there are sets whose independence is not preserved under this map $ {[1 0 0],[0 2 0]} ↦{[1 0],[2 0]} $ and so not all sets have independence preserved.   says that for there to be an onto homomorphism from a vector space $V$ to a vector space $W$, it is necessary that the dimension of $W$ be less than or equal to the dimension of $V$. Prove that this condition is also sufficient; use to show that if the dimension of $W$ is less than or equal to the dimension of $V$, then there is a homomorphism from $V$ to $W$ that is onto.  (We use the notation from .) Fix a basis $sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n}$ for $V$ and a basis $sequence{vec(w)_1,...,vec(w)_k}$ for $W$. If the dimension $k$ of $W$ is less than or equal to the dimension $n$ of $V$ then the theorem gives a linear map from $V$ to $W$ determined in this way. $ vec(β)_1↦vec(w)_1,...,vec(β)_k↦vec(w)_k and vec(β)_{k+1}↦vec(w)_k, ...,vec(β)_n↦vec(w)_k $ We need only to verify that this map is onto.  We can write any member of $W$ as a linear combination of basis elements $c_1· vec(w)_1+...+c_k· vec(w)_k$. This vector is the image, under the map described above, of $c_1· vec(β)_1+...+c_k· vec(β)_k +0· vec(β)_{k+1}...+0· vec(β)_n$. Thus the map is onto.   Recall that the null space is a subset of the domain and the range space is a subset of the codomain. Are they necessarily distinct? Is there a homomorphism that has a nontrivial intersection of its null space and its range space?  Yes. For the transformation of $ ℝ^2 $ given by $ [x y]h ↓[0 x] $ we have this. $ νllspace{h}={[0 y] such that y in ℝ} =h $ Remark. We will see more of this in the fifth chapter.   Prove that the image of a span equals the span of the images. That is, where $ h: V → W $ is linear, prove that if $ S $ is a subset of $ V $ then $ h(span(S)) $ equals $ span(h(S)) $. This generalizes since it shows that if $ U $ is any subspace of $ V $ then its image $ {h(vec{{u}) such that vec{{u} in U} $ is a subspace of $ W $, because the span of the set $U$ is $U$.  This is a simple calculation. $ h(span(S)) ={h(c_1vec{{s}_1+...+c_nvec{{s}_n) such that text{$ c_1,...,c_n in ℝ $ and $ vec(s)_1,...,vec(s)_n in S $} } ={c_1h(vec{{s}_1)+...+c_nh(vec{{s}_n) such that text{$ c_1,...,c_n in ℝ $ and $ vec(s)_1,...,vec(s)_n in S $} } =span(h(S)) $    Prove that for any linear map $ h: V → W $ and any $ vec(w) in W $, the set $ h^{-1}(vec(w)) $ has the form $ {vec{{v}+vec{{n} such that vec{{n} inνllspace{{h} } $ for $ vec(v) in V $ with $ h(vec(v))=vec(w) $ (if $ h $ is not onto then this set may be empty). Such a set is a coset of $ νllspace{h} $ and we denote it as $ vec(v)+νllspace{h} $. Consider the map $ t: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ given by $ [x y] t ↓ [ax+by cx+dy] $ for some scalars $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. Prove that $ t $ is linear.  Conclude from the prior two items that for any linear system of the form $ $ ax + by = e cx + dy = f $ $ we can write the solution set (the vectors are members of $ ℝ^2$) $ {vec{{p}+vec{{h} such that $ vec(h $ satisfies the associated homogeneous system) } $ where $ vec(p) $ is a particular solution of that linear system (if there is no particular solution then the above set is empty). Show that this map $ h: ℝ^n → ℝ^m $ is linear $ [x_1 ... x_n] ↦ [a_{1,1]x_1+...+a_{1,n}x_n ... a_{m,1}x_1+...+a_{m,n}x_n} $ for any scalars $ a_{1,1} $, ..., $ a_{m,n} $. Extend the conclusion made in the prior item. Show that the $ k $-th derivative map is a linear transformation of $ polyspace(_n) $ for each $ k $. Prove that this map is a linear transformation of the space $ f↦ (d^k/dx^k)f+c_{k-1}frac{d^{k-1}}{dx^{k-1}}f +...+ c_1(d/dx)f+c_0f $ for any scalars $ c_k $, ..., $ c_0 $. Draw a conclusion as above.     We will show the sets are equal $h^{-1}(vec(w)) ={vec{{v}+vec{{n} such that vec{{n} inνllspace{{h} }$ by mutual inclusion. For the ${vec{{v}+vec{{n} such that vec{{n} inνllspace{{h} } ⊆ h^{-1}(vec(w))$ direction, just note that $h(vec(v)+vec(n))=h(vec(v))+h(vec(n))$ equals $vec(w)$, and so any member of the first set is a member of the second. For the $h^{-1}(vec(w)) ⊆{vec{{v}+vec{{n} such that vec{{n} inνllspace{{h} }$ direction, consider $vec(u) in h^{-1}(vec(w))$. Because $ h $ is linear, $ h(vec(u))=h(vec(v)) $ implies that $ h(vec(u)-vec(v))=0 $. We can write $ vec(u)-vec(v) $ as $ vec(n) $, and then we have that $vec(u) in{vec{{v}+vec{{n} such that vec{{n} inνllspace{{h} }$, as desired, because $vec(u)=vec(v)+(vec(u)-vec(v))$. This check is routine. This is immediate. For the linearity check, briefly, where $ c,d $ are scalars and $ vec(x),vec(y) in ℝ^n $ have components $ x_1,...,x_n $ and $ y_1,...,y_n $, we have this. $ h(c· vec(x)+d· vec(y)) =[a_{1,1](cx_1+dy_1)+...+a_{1,n}(cx_n+dy_n) ... a_{m,1}(cx_1+dy_1)+...+a_{m,n}(cx_n+dy_n)} =[a_{1,1]cx_1+...+a_{1,n}cx_n ... a_{m,1}cx_1+...+a_{m,n}cx_n} +[a_{1,1]dy_1+...+a_{1,n}dy_n ... a_{m,1}dy_1+...+a_{m,n}dy_n} =c· h(vec(x))+d· h(vec(y)) $ The appropriate conclusion is that $ General=Particular+Homogeneous $. Each power of the derivative is linear because of the rules $ (d^k/dx^k)(f(x)+g(x))=(d^k/dx^k)f(x) +(d^k/dx^k)g(x) and (d^k/dx^k)rf(x)=r(d^k/dx^k)f(x) $ from calculus. Thus the given map is a linear transformation of the space because any linear combination of linear maps is also a linear map by . The appropriate conclusion is $ General=Particular+Homogeneous $, where the associated homogeneous differential equation has a constant of $ 0 $.    Prove that for any transformation $ t: V → V $ that is rank one, the map given by composing the operator with itself $ map{∘{t}{t}}{V}{V} $ satisfies $ ∘{t}{t}=r· t $ for some real number $ r $.  Because the rank of $ t $ is one, the range space of $ t $ is a one-dimensional set. Taking $sequence{h(vec(v))}$ as a basis (for some appropriate $vec(v)$), we have that for every $vec(w) in V$, the image $h(vec(w)) in V$ is a multiple of this basis vector- associated with each $vec(w)$ there is a scalar $ c_{vec(w)} $ such that $ t(vec(w))=c_{vec(w)}t(vec(v)) $. Apply $ t $ to both sides of that equation and take $ r $ to be $ c_{t(vec(v))} $ $ ∘{t}{t}(vec(w)) =t(c_{vec(w)}· t(vec(v))) =c_{vec(w)}·∘{t}{t}(vec(v)) =c_{vec(w)}· c_{t(vec(v))}· t(vec(v)) =c_{vec(w)}· r· t(vec(v)) =r· c_{vec(w)}· t(vec(v)) =r· t(vec(w)) $ to get the desired conclusion.   Let $ h: V → ℝ $ be a homomorphism, but not the zero homomorphism. Prove that if $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ is a basis for the null space and if $ vec(v) in V $ is not in the null space then $ sequence{vec(v),vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ is a basis for the entire domain $ V $.  By assumption, $ h $ is not the zero map and so a vector $ vec(v) in V $ exists that is not in the null space. Note that $ sequence{h(vec(v))} $ is a basis for $ ℝ $, because it is a size-one linearly independent subset of $ ℝ $. Consequently $ h $ is onto, as for any $ r in ℝ $ we have $ r=c· h(vec(v)) $ for some scalar $ c $, and so $ r=h(cvec(v)) $.  Thus the rank of $ h $ is one. Because the nullity is $n$, the dimension of the domain of $ h $, the vector space $ V $, is $ n+1 $. We can finish by showing $ {vec{{v},vec{{β}_1,...,vec{{β}_n} $ is linearly independent, as it is a size~$n+1$ subset of a dimension~$n+1$ space. Because $ {vec{{β}_1,...,vec{{β}_n} $ is linearly independent we need only show that $ vec(v) $ is not a linear combination of the other vectors. But $ c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n=vec(v) $ would give $ -vec(v)+c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n=0 $ and applying $ h $ to both sides would give a contradiction.   Show that for any space $ V $ of dimension $ n $, the dual space $ linmaps(V){ ℝ}={map{{h}{{V}{{ ℝ} such that {$ h $ is linear} $ is isomorphic to $ ℝ^n $. It is often denoted $V^ast$. Conclude that $ V^ast≅ V $.  Fix a basis $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ for $ V $. We shall prove that this map $ hPhi↓ [h( vec{β]_1) ... h(vec(β)_n)} $ is an isomorphism from $ V^ast$ to $ ℝ^n $.  To see that $Phi$ is one-to-one, assume that $h_1$ and $h_2$ are members of $V^ast$ such that $Phi(h_1)=Phi(h_2)$. Then $ [h_1( vec{β]_1) ... h_1(vec(β)_n)} =[h_2( vec{β]_1) ... h_2(vec(β)_n)} $ and consequently, $h_1(vec(β)_1)=h_2(vec(β)_1)$, etc. But a homomorphism is determined by its action on a basis, so $ h_1=h_2 $, and therefore $ Phi$ is one-to-one.  To see that $Phi$ is onto, consider $ [x_1 ... x_n] $ for $ x_1,...,x_n in ℝ $. This function $h$ from $V$ to $ ℝ$ $ c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n h ↓ c_1x_1+...+c_nx_n $ is linear and $Phi$ maps it to the given vector in $ ℝ^n$, so $ Phi$ is onto.  The map $ Phi$ also preserves structure:~where $ c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n h_1 ↓ c_1h_1(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nh_1(vec(β)_n) c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n h_2 ↓ c_1h_2(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nh_2(vec(β)_n) $ we have $ (r_1h_1+r_2h_2)(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n) $ = c_1(r_1h_1(vec(β)_1)+r_2h_2(vec(β)_1)) +... +c_n(r_1h_1(vec(β)_n)+r_2h_2(vec(β)_n)) = r_1(c_1h_1(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nh_1(vec(β)_n)) + r_2(c_1h_2(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nh_2(vec(β)_n)) $ $ so $ Phi(r_1h_1+r_2h_2)=r_1Phi(h_1)+r_2Phi(h_2) $.   Show that any linear map is the sum of maps of rank one.  Let $ h: V → W $ be linear and fix a basis $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ for $ V $. Consider these $ n $ maps from $ V $ to $ W $ $ h_1(vec(v))=c_1· h(vec(β)_1),  h_2(vec(v))=c_2· h(vec(β)_2), ... , h_n(vec(v))=c_n· h(vec(β)_n) $ for any $ vec(v)=c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n $. Clearly $ h $ is the sum of the $ h_i $'s. We need only check that each $ h_i $ is linear:~where $ vec(u)=d_1vec(β)_1+...+d_nvec(β)_n $ we have $ h_i(rvec(v)+svec(u))=rc_i+sd_i=rh_i(vec(v))+sh_i(vec(u)) $.   Is `is homomorphic to' an equivalence relation? (Hint:~the difficulty is to decide on an appropriate meaning for the quoted phrase.)  Either yes (trivially) or no (nearly trivially).  If we take $ V $ `is homomorphic to' $ W $ to mean there is a homomorphism from $ V $ into (but not necessarily onto) $ W $, then every space is homomorphic to every other space as a zero map always exists.  If we take $ V $ `is homomorphic to' $ W $ to mean there is an onto homomorphism from $ V $ to $ W $ then the relation is not an equivalence. For instance, there is an onto homomorphism from $ ℝ^3 $ to $ ℝ^2 $ (projection is one) but no homomorphism from $ ℝ^2 $ onto $ ℝ^3 $ by , so the relation is not reflexive.   Show that the range spaces and null spaces of powers of linear maps $ t: V → V $ form descending $ V⊇ t⊇t^2⊇... $ and ascending $ {vec{{0}}⊆νllspace{t}⊆νllspace{t^2}⊆... $ chains. Also show that if $ k $ is such that $ t^k=rangespace{t^{k+1}} $ then all following range spaces are equal: $ t^k=rangespace{t^{k+1}}=rangespace{t^{k+2}}... $. Similarly, if $ νllspace{t^k}=νllspace{t^{k+1}} $ then $ νllspace{t^k}=νllspace{t^{k+1}}=νllspace{t^{k+2}}=... $.  That they form the chains is obvious. For the rest, we show here that $ rangespace{t^{j+1}}=rangespace{t^{j}} $ implies that $ rangespace{t^{j+2}}=rangespace{t^{j+1}} $. Induction then applies.  Assume that $ rangespace{t^{j+1}}=rangespace{t^{j}} $. Then $ map(t){rangespace{t^{j+1}}}{rangespace{t^{j+2}}} $ is the same map, with the same domain, as $ map(t){rangespace{t^{j}}}{rangespace{t^{j+1}}} $. Thus it has the same range: $ rangespace{t^{j+2}}=rangespace{t^{j+1}} $.         The prior section shows that a linear map is determined by its action on a basis. The equation $ h(vec(v)) =h(c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_n·vec(β)_n) =c_1· h(vec(β)_1)+... +c_n· h(vec(β)_n) $ describes how we get the value of the map on any vector $vec(v)$ by starting from the value of the map on the vectors $vec(β)_i$ in a basis and extending linearly.    This section gives a convenient scheme based on matrices to use the representations of $ h(vec(β)_1) $, ..., $ h(vec(β)_n) $ to compute, from the representation of a vector in the domain $rep{vec(v)}{B}$, the representation of that vector's image in the codomain $rep{h(vec(v))}{D}$.                 For example For the spaces $ ℝ^2$ and $ ℝ^3$ fix these bases. $ B=sequence{ [2 0], [1 4]}  D=sequence{ [1 0 0], [0 -2 0], [1 0 1]} $ Consider the map $h: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3$ that is determined by this association. $ [2 0] h ↓ [1 1 1]  [1 4] h ↓ [1 2 0] $ To compute the action of this map on any vector at all from the domain we first represent the vector $h(vec(β)_1)$ $ [1 1 1]= 0[1 0 0] -(1/2)[0 -2 0] +1[1 0 1]  rep{ h(vec(β)_1) }{D}=[0 -1/2 1]_D $ and the vector $h(vec(β)_2)$. $ [1 2 0]= 1[1 0 0] -1[0 -2 0] +0[1 0 1]  rep{ h(vec(β)_2) }{D}=[1 -1 0]_D $ With these, for any member $vec(v)$ of the domain we can compute $h(vec(v))$. $ h(vec(v)) =h(c_1· [2 0]+c_2· [1 4]) =c_1· h([2 0])+c_2· h([1 4]) =c_1· ( 0[1 0 0] -(1/2)[0 -2 0] +1[1 0 1] ) +c_2· ( 1[1 0 0] -1[0 -2 0] +0[1 0 1] ) =(0c_1+1c_2)· [1 0 0] +(-(1/2)c_1-1c_2)· [0 -2 0] +(1c_1+0c_2)· [1 0 1] $ Thus,  if $rep{vec(v)}{B}=[c_1 c_2]$ then $rep{h(vec(v))}{D} =[0c_1+1c_2 -(1/2)c_1-1c_2 1c_1+0c_2]$.  For instance,  since $Representation of ([4 8])=[1 2]_B$ we have $Representation of (h([4 8])) =[2 -5/2 1]$.    We express computations like the one above with a matrix notation. $ ([ 0 1 -1/2 -1 1 0 ])_{B,D} [c_1 c_2]_B = [0c_1+1c_2 (-1/2)c_1-1c_2 1c_1+0c_2]_D $ In the middle is the argument $vec(v)$ to the map, represented with respect to the domain's basis $B$ by the column vector with components $c_1$ and $c_2$. On the right is the value of the map on that argument $h(vec(v))$, represented with respect to the codomain's basis $D$. The matrix on the left is the new thing. We will use it to represent the map and we will think of the above equation as representing an application of the map to the matrix.  That matrix consists of the coefficients from the vector on the right, $0$ and $1$ from the first row, $-1/2$ and $-1$ from the second row, and $1$ and $0$ from the third row. That is, we make it by adjoining the vectors representing the $h(vec(β)_i)$'s. $ ($ ... ... rep{h(vec(β)_1)}{D} rep{h(vec(β)_2)}{D} ... ... $) $    Suppose that $ V $ and $ W $ are vector spaces of dimensions $ n $ and $ m $ with bases $ B $ and $ D $, and that $ h: V → W $ is a linear map. If $ rep{h( vec(β)_1 )}{D} = [h_{1,1] h_{2,1} ... h_{m,1}}_D ... rep{h( vec(β)_n )}{D} = [h_{1,n] h_{2,n} ... h_{m,n}}_D $ then $ Representation of (h)=general_matrix(h, n, m)_{B,D} $ is the matrix representation of $ h $ with respect to $ B, D $.      In that matrix the number of columns~$n$ is the dimension of the map's domain while the number of rows~$m$ is the dimension of the codomain.  We use lower case letters for a map, upper case for the matrix, and lower case again for the entries of the matrix. Thus for the map $ h $, the matrix representing it is $ H $, with entries $ h_{i,j} $.  For example If $ h: ℝ^3 → polyspace(_1) $ is $ [a_1 a_2 a_3] h ↓ (2a_1+a_2)+(-a_3)x $ then where $ B= sequence{[0 0 1], [0 2 0], [2 0 0] }  D= 1+x,-1+x $ the action of $ h $ on $ B $ is this. $ [0 0 1]h ↓-x [0 2 0]h ↓2 [2 0 0]h ↓4 $ A simple calculation $ Representation of (-x)=[-1/2 -1/2]_D Representation of (2)=[1 -1]_D Representation of (4)=[2 -2]_D $ shows that this is the matrix representing $h$ with respect to the bases. $ Representation of (h) = ([ -1/2 1 2 -1/2 -1 -2 ])_{B,D} $     Assume that $ V $ and $ W $ are vector spaces of dimensions $ n $ and $ m $ with bases $ B $ and $ D $, and that $ h: V → W $ is a linear map. If $ h $ is represented by $ Representation of (h)=general_matrix(h, n, m)_{B,D} $ and $ vec(v) in V $ is represented by $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=[c_1 c_2 ... c_n]_B $ then the representation of the image of $vec(v)$ is this. $ rep{ h(vec(v)) }{D} = [h_{1,1]c_1+h_{1,2}c_2+...+h_{1,n}c_n h_{2,1}c_1+h_{2,2}c_2+...+h_{2,n}c_n ... h_{m,1}c_1+h_{m,2}c_2+...+h_{m,n}c_n}_D $      This formalizes . See .      The matrix-vector product  of a $ N by M $ matrix and a $ N by M $ vector is this. $ general_matrix(a, n, m) [c_1 ... c_n] = [a_{1,1]c_1+...+a_{1,n}c_n a_{2,1}c_1+...+a_{2,n}c_n ... a_{m,1}c_1+...+a_{m,n}c_n} $      Briefly, application of a linear map is represented by the matrix-vector product of the map's representative and the vector's representative.   is not surprising, because we chose the matrix representative in def:MatRepMap precisely to make the theorem true- if the theorem were not true then we would adjust the definition to make it so. Nonetheless, we need the verification.   For example For the matrix from we can calculate where that map sends this vector. $ vec(v)=[4 1 0] $ With respect to the domain basis $B$ the representation of this vector is $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=[0 1/2 2]_B $ and so the matrix-vector product gives the representation of the value $h(vec(v))$ with respect to the codomain basis $D$. $ rep{h(vec(v))}{D} =([ -1/2 1 2 -1/2 -1 -2 ])_{B,D} [0 1/2 2]_B =colvec{(-1/2)· 0+1· (1/2) + 2· 2 (-1/2)· 0-1· (1/2) - 2· 2}_D =[9/2 -9/2]_D $ To find $h(vec(v))$ itself, not its representation, take $(9/2)(1+x)-(9/2)(-1+x)=9$.   For example Let $ π: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2 $ be projection onto the $ xy $-plane. To give a matrix representing this map, we first fix some bases. $ B=sequence{ [1 0 0], [1 1 0], [-1 0 1] }  D=sequence{ [2 1], [1 1] } $ For each vector in the domain's basis, find its image under the map. $ [1 0 0]π ↓[1 0]  [1 1 0]π ↓[1 1]  [-1 0 1]π ↓[-1 0] $ Then find the representation of each image with respect to the codomain's basis. $ Representation of ([1 0])=[1 -1]  Representation of ([1 1])=[0 1]  Representation of ([-1 0])=[-1 1] $ Finally, adjoining these representations gives the matrix representing $ π $ with respect to $ B,D $. $ Representation of (π) =([ 1 0 -1 -1 1 1 ])_{B,D} $ We can illustrate by computing the matrix-vector product representing this action by the projection map. $ π( [2 2 1] )=[2 2] $ Represent the domain vector with respect to the domain's basis $ Representation of ([2 2 1])= [1 2 1]_B $ to get this matrix-vector product. $ Representation of ( π([2 2 1]))= ([ 1 0 -1 -1 1 1 ])_{B,D} [1 2 1]_B = [0 2]_D $ Expanding this into a linear combination of vectors from $ D $ $ 0·[2 1] +2·[1 1] = [2 2] $ checks that the map's action is indeed reflected in the operation of the matrix. We will sometimes compress these three displayed equations into one. $ [2 2 1]=[1 2 1]_B overset(h){H under ↦} [0 2]_D=[2 2] $   We now have two ways to compute the effect of projection, the straightforward formula that drops each three-tall vector's third component to make a two-tall vector, and the above formula that uses representations and matrix-vector multiplication. The second way may seem complicated compared to the first, but it has advantages. The next example shows that for some maps this new scheme simplifies the formula.  For example To represent a rotation map $map{t_{θ}}{ ℝ^2}{ ℝ^2}$ that turns all vectors in the plane counterclockwise through an angle $θ$    we start by fixing the standard bases $stdbasis(_2)$ for both the domain and codomain basis, Now find the image under the map of each vector in the domain's basis. $ [1 0]t_θ ↓[ cosθ sinθ]  [0 1]t_θ ↓[- sinθ cosθ]  $ Represent these images with respect to the codomain's basis. Because this basis is $stdbasis(_2)$, vectors represent themselves. Adjoin the representations to get the matrix representing the map. $ Representation of (t_θ) = ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) sin(θ) cos(θ) ]) $ The advantage of this scheme is that we get a formula for the image of any vector at all just by knowing in~($*$) how to represent the image of the two basis vectors. For instance, here we rotate a vector by $θ=π/6$. $ [3 -2] = [3 -2]_{stdbasis(_2)}mapsunder{t_{π/6}} ([ √{3}/2 -1/2 1/2 √{3}/2 ]) [3 -2] ≈ [3.598 -0.232]_{stdbasis(_2)} = [3.598 -0.232] $ More generally, we have a formula for rotation by $θ=π/6$. $ [x y] mapsunder{t_{π/6}} ([ √{3}/2 -1/2 1/2 √{3}/2 ]) [x y] = [(√{3]/2)x-(1/2)y (1/2)x+(√{3}/2)y } $   For example In the definition of matrix-vector product the width of the matrix equals the height of the vector. Hence, this product is not defined. $ ([ 1 0 0 4 3 1 ]) [1 0] $ It is undefined for a reason:~the three-wide matrix represents a map with a three-dimensional domain while the two-tall vector represents a member of a two-dimensional space. So the vector cannot be in the domain of the map.   Nothing in def:MatrixVecProd forces us to view matrix-vector product in terms of representations. We can get some insights by focusing on how the entries combine.  A good way to view matrix-vector product is that it is formed from the dot products of the rows of the matrix with the column vector. $ ([ ... a_{i,1} a_{i,2} ... a_{i,n} ... ]) [c_1 c_2 ... c_n] = [... a_{i,1]c_1+a_{i,2}c_2+·s+a_{i,n}c_n ...} $ Looked at in this row-by-row way, this new operation generalizes dot product.  We can also view the operation column-by-column. $ general_matrix(h, n, m) [c_1 c_2 ... c_n] =[h_{1,1]c_1+h_{1,2}c_2+...+h_{1,n}c_n h_{2,1}c_1+h_{2,2}c_2+...+h_{2,n}c_n ... h_{m,1}c_1+h_{m,2}c_2+...+h_{m,n}c_n} =c_1[h_{1,1] h_{2,1} ... h_{m,1}}  +... +c_n[h_{1,n] h_{2,n} ... h_{m,n}} $ The result is the columns of the matrix weighted by the entries of the vector.  For example $ ([ 1 0 -1 2 0 3 ]) [2 -1 1] = 2[1 2] -1[0 0] +1[-1 3] = [1 7] $   This way of looking at matrix-vector product brings us back to the objective stated at the start of this section, to compute $ h(c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n) $ as $ c_1h(vec(β)_1)+...+c_nh(vec(β)_n) $.  We began this section by noting that the equality of these two enables us to compute the action of $h$ on any argument knowing only $h(vec(β)_1)$, ..., $h(vec(β)_n)$. We have developed this into a scheme to compute the action of the map by taking the matrix-vector product of the matrix representing the map with the vector representing the argument. In this way, with respect to any bases, for any linear map there is a matrix representation. The next subsection will show the converse, that if we fix bases then for any matrix there is an associated linear map.     Multiply the matrix $ ([ 1 3 1 0 -1 2 1 1 0 ]) $ by each vector, or state ``not defined.''  $ [2 1 0] $ $ [-2 -2] $ $ [0 0 0] $    $ colvec{1· 2+3· 1+1· 0 0· 2+(-1)· 1+2· 0 1· 2+1· 1+0· 0} =[5 -1 3] $ Not defined. $ [0 0 0] $    Perform, if possible, each matrix-vector multiplication.  $([ 2 1 3 -1/2 ]) [4 2]$ $([ 1 1 0 -2 1 0 ]) [1 3 1]$ $([ 1 1 -2 1 ]) [1 3 1]$    $colvec{2· 4 +1· 2 3· 4-(1/2)· 2} =[10 11]$ $[4 1]$ Not defined.    Solve this matrix equation. $ ([ 2 1 1 0 1 3 1 -1 2 ]) [x y z] =[8 4 4] $  Matrix-vector multiplication gives rise to a linear system. $ $ 2x + y + z = 8 y + 3z = 4 x - y + 2z = 4 $ $ Gaussian reduction shows that $ z=1 $, $ y=1 $, and $ x=3 $.   For a homomorphism from $ polyspace(_2) $ to $ polyspace(_3) $ that sends $ 1↦ 1+x,  x↦ 1+2x, and x^2↦ x-x^3 $ where does $ 1-3x+2x^2 $ go?  Here are two ways to get the answer.  First, obviously $1-3x+2x^2=1· 1-3· x+2· x^2$, and so we can apply the general property of preservation of combinations to get $h(1-3x+2x^2) =h(1· 1-3· x+2· x^2) =1· h(1)-3· h(x)+2· h(x^2) =1· (1+x)-3· (1+2x)+2· (x-x^3) =-2-3x-2x^3$.  The other way uses the computation scheme developed in this subsection. Because we know where these elements of the space go, we consider this basis $ B=1,x,x^2 $ for the domain. Arbitrarily, we can take $ D=1,x,x^2,x^3 $ as a basis for the codomain. With those choices, we have that $ Representation of (h) =([ 1 1 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 ])_{B,D} $ and, as $ Representation of (1-3x+2x^2)=[1 -3 2]_B $ the matrix-vector multiplication calculation gives this. $ Representation of (h(1-3x+2x^2))= ([ 1 1 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 ])_{B,D} [1 -3 2]_B =[-2 -3 0 -2]_D $ Thus, $ h(1-3x+2x^2) =-2· 1-3· x+0· x^2-2· x^3 =-2-3x-2x^3 $, as above.   Assume that $ h: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3 $ is determined by this action. $ [1 0]↦[2 2 0]  [0 1]↦[0 1 -1] $ Using the standard bases, find  the matrix representing this map; a general formula for $ h(vec(v)) $.   Again, as recalled in the subsection, with respect to $stdbasis(_i)$, a column vector represents itself.  To represent $ h $ with respect to $ stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_3) $ take the images of the basis vectors from the domain, and represent them with respect to the basis for the codomain. The first is this $ rep{h(vec(e)_1)}{stdbasis(_3)} =Representation of ([2 2 0]) =[2 2 0] $ while the second is this. $ rep{h(vec(e)_2)}{stdbasis(_3)} =Representation of ([0 1 -1]) =[0 1 -1] $ Adjoin these to make the matrix. $ Representation of (h)= ([ 2 0 2 1 0 -1 ]) $ For any $ vec(v) $ in the domain $ ℝ^2 $, $ rep{vec(v)}{stdbasis(_2)} =Representation of ([v_1 v_2]) =[v_1 v_2] $ and so $ rep{h(vec(v))}{stdbasis(_3)} =([ 2 0 2 1 0 -1 ]) [v_1 v_2] =[2v_1 2v_1+v_2 -v_2] $ is the desired representation.   Represent the homomorphism $h: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2$ given by this formula and with respect to these bases. $ [x y z]↦[x+y x+z]  B=sequence{[1 1 1], [1 1 0], [1 0 0]}  D=sequence{[1 0], [0 2]} $  The action of the map on the domain's basis vectors is this. $ [1 1 1]↦[2 2]  [1 1 0]↦[2 1]  [1 0 0]↦[1 1] $ Represent those with respect to the codomain's basis. $ Representation of ([2 2])=[2 1]_D  Representation of ([2 1])=[2 1/2]_D  Representation of ([1 1])=[1 1/2]_D $ Concatenate them together into a matrix. $ Representation of (h)= ([ 2 2 1 1 1/2 1/2 ]) $   Let $ d/dx: polyspace(_3) → polyspace(_3) $ be the derivative transformation.  Represent $ d/dx $ with respect to $ B,B $ where $ B=1,x,x^2,x^3 $. Represent $ d/dx $ with respect to $ B,D $ where $ D=1,2x,3x^2,4x^3 $.     We must first find the image of each vector from the domain's basis, and then represent that image with respect to the codomain's basis. $ (d1/dx){B}=[0 0 0 0]  (dx/dx){B}=[1 0 0 0]  (dx^2/dx){B}=[0 2 0 0]  (dx^3/dx){B}=[0 0 3 0] $ Those representations are then adjoined to make the matrix representing the map. $ (d/dx){B,B}= ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Proceeding as in the prior item, we represent the images of the domain's basis vectors $ (d1/dx){D}=[0 0 0 0]  (dx/dx){D}=[1 0 0 0]  (dx^2/dx){D}=[0 1 0 0]  (dx^3/dx){D}=[0 0 1 0] $ and adjoin to make the matrix. $ (d/dx){B,D}= ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]) $    Represent each linear map with respect to each pair of bases.  $ d/dx: polyspace(_n) → polyspace(_n) $ with respect to $ B,B $ where $ B=1,x,...,x^n $, given by $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+...+a_nx^n ↦ a_1+2a_2x+...+na_nx^{n-1} $ $ map( int){polyspace(_n)}{polyspace(_){n+1}} $ with respect to $ B_n,B_{n+1} $ where $ B_i=1,x,...,x^i $, given by $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+...+a_nx^n ↦ a_0x+(a_1/2)x^2+...+(a_n/n+1)x^{n+1} $ $ int^1_0: polyspace(_n) → ℝ $ with respect to $ B,stdbasis(_1) $ where $ B=1,x,...,x^n $ and $ stdbasis(_1)=1 $, given by $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+...+a_nx^n ↦ a_0+(a_1/2)+...+(a_n/n+1) $ $ eval_3: polyspace(_n) → ℝ $ with respect to $ B,stdbasis(_1) $ where $ B=1,x,...,x^n $ and $ stdbasis(_1)=1 $, given by $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+...+a_nx^n ↦ a_0+a_1· 3+a_2· 3^2+...+a_n· 3^n $ $ map{slide_{-1}}{polyspace(_n)}{polyspace(_n)} $ with respect to $ B,B $ where $ B=1,x,...,x^n $, given by $ a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+...+a_nx^n ↦ a_0+a_1· (x+1)+...+a_n· (x+1)^n $   For each, we must find the image of each of the domain's basis vectors, represent each image with respect to the codomain's basis, and then adjoin those representations to get the matrix.  The basis vectors from the domain have these images $ 1↦ 0 x↦ 1 x^2↦ 2x ... $ and these images are represented with respect to the codomain's basis in this way. $ Representation of (0)=[0 0 0 ... ]  Representation of (1)=[1 0 0 ... ]  Representation of (2x)=[0 2 0 ... ] ... rep{nx^{n-1}}{B}=[0 0 0 ... n 0] $ The matrix $ (d/dx){B,B} =([ 0 1 0 ... 0 0 0 2 ... 0 ... 0 0 0 ... n 0 0 0 ... 0 ]) $ has $n+1$ rows and columns. Once the images under this map of the domain's basis vectors are determined $ 1↦ x x↦ x^2/2 x^2↦ x^3/3 ... $ then they can be represented with respect to the codomain's basis $ x{B_{n+1}}=[0 1 0 ... ]  x^2/2{B_{n+1}}=[0 0 1/2 ... ] ... rep{x^{n+1}/(n+1)}{B_{n+1}} =[0 0 0 ... 1/(n+1)] $ and put together to make the matrix. $ int{B_{n},B_{n+1}} =([ 0 0 ... 0 0 1 0 ... 0 0 0 1/2 ... 0 0 ... 0 0 ... 0 1/(n+1) ]) $ The images of the basis vectors of the domain are $ 1↦ 1 x↦ 1/2 x^2↦ 1/3 ... $ and they are represented with respect to the codomain's basis as $ Representation of (1)=1 Representation of (1/2)=1/2 ... $ so the matrix is $ Representation of ( int) =([ 1 1/2 ·s 1/n 1/(n+1) ]) $ (this is an $nbym(1){(n+1)}$ matrix). Here, the images of the domain's basis vectors are $ 1↦ 1 x↦ 3 x^2↦ 9 ... $ and they are represented in the codomain as $ Representation of (1)=1 Representation of (3)=3 Representation of (9)=9 ... $ and so the matrix is this. $ Representation of ( int_0^1) =([ 1 3 9 ·s 3^n ]) $ The images of the basis vectors from the domain are $1↦ 1$, and $x↦ x+1=1+x$, and $x^2↦ (x+1)^2=1+2x+x^2$, and $x^3↦ (x+1)^3=1+3x+3x^2+x^3$, etc. The representations are here. $ Representation of (1)=[1 0 0 0 ... 0]  Representation of (1+x)=[1 1 0 0 ... 0]  Representation of (1+2x+x^2)=[1 2 1 0 ... 0] ... $ The resulting matrix $  rep{slide_{-1}}{B,B} =([ 1 1 1 1 ... 1 0 1 2 3 ... (n choose 1) 0 0 1 3 ... (n choose 2) ... 0 0 0 ... 1 ]) $ is Pascal's triangle (recall that $(n choose r)$ is the number of ways to choose $r$ things, without order and without repetition, from a set of size $n$).    Represent the identity map on any nontrivial space with respect to $ B,B $, where $ B $ is any basis.  Where the space is $ n $-dimensional, $ Representation of (id)= ([ 1 0 ... 0 0 1 ... 0 ... 0 0 ... 1 ])_{B,B} $ is the $N by N$ identity matrix.   Represent, with respect to the natural basis, the transpose transformation on the space $ matspace(_){N by N} $ of $N by N$ matrices.  Taking this as the natural basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2,vec(β)_3,vec(β)_4} =sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 1 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 1 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } $ the transpose map acts in this way $ vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_1 vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3 vec(β)_3↦vec(β)_2 vec(β)_4↦vec(β)_4 $ so that representing the images with respect to the codomain's basis and adjoining those column vectors together gives this. $ Representation of (trans)= ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ])_{B,B} $   Assume that $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2,vec(β)_3,vec(β)_4} $ is a basis for a vector space. Represent with respect to $ B,B $ the transformation that is determined by each.  $ vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2 $, $ vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3 $, $ vec(β)_3↦vec(β)_4 $, $ vec(β)_4↦0 $ $ vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2 $, $ vec(β)_2↦0 $, $ vec(β)_3↦vec(β)_4 $, $ vec(β)_4↦0 $ $ vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2 $, $ vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3 $, $ vec(β)_3↦0 $, $ vec(β)_4↦0 $    With respect to the basis of the codomain, the images of the members of the basis of the domain are represented as $ rep{vec(β)_2}{B}=[0 1 0 0]  rep{vec(β)_3}{B}=[0 0 1 0]  rep{vec(β)_4}{B}=[0 0 0 1]  Representation of (0)=[0 0 0 0] $ and consequently, the matrix representing the transformation is this. $ ([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $  $([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ])$  $([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])$    shows how to represent the rotation transformation of the plane with respect to the standard basis. Express these other transformations also with respect to the standard basis.  the dilation map $d_s$, which multiplies all vectors by the same scalar $s$ the reflection map $f_l$, which reflects all all vectors across a line $l$ through the origin    The picture of $d_s: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2$ is this.    This map's effect on the vectors in the standard basis for the domain is $ [1 0]d_s ↓[s 0]  [0 1]d_s ↓[0 s] $ and those images are represented with respect to the codomain's basis (again, the standard basis) by themselves. $ Representation of ([s 0])=[s 0]  Representation of ([0 s])=[0 s] $ Thus the representation of the dilation map is this. $ Representation of (d_s) =([ s 0 0 s ]) $ The picture of $f_l: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2$ is this.    Some calculation (see Exercise~I.) shows that when the line has slope $k$ $ [1 0] f_l ↓[(1-k^2)/(1+k^2) 2k/(1+k^2)]  [0 1] f_l ↓[2k/(1+k^2) -(1-k^2)/(1+k^2)] $ (the case of a line with undefined slope is separate but easy) and so the matrix representing reflection is this. $ Representation of (f_l) =(1/1+k^2)·([ 1-k^2 2k 2k -(1-k^2) ]) $    Consider a linear transformation of $ ℝ^2 $ determined by these two. $ [1 1]↦[2 0]  [1 0]↦[-1 0] $  Represent this transformation with respect to the standard bases. Where does the transformation send this vector? $ [0 5] $ Represent this transformation with respect to these bases. $ B=[1 -1],[1 1]  D=[2 2],[-1 1] $ Using $ B $ from the prior item, represent the transformation with respect to $ B,B $.   Call the map $ t: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $.  To represent this map with respect to the standard bases, we must find, and then represent, the images of the vectors $vec(e)_1$ and $vec(e)_2$ from the domain's basis. The image of $vec(e)_1$ is given.  One way to find the image of $vec(e)_2$ is by eye- we can see this. $ [1 1]-[1 0]=[0 1] t ↓ [2 0]-[-1 0]=[3 0] $  A more systematic way to find the image of $vec(e)_2$ is to use the given information to represent the transformation, and then use that representation to determine the image. Taking this for a basis, $ C=[1 1],[1 0] $ the given information says this. $ Representation of (t) ([ 2 -1 0 0 ]) $ As $ rep{vec(e)_2}{C}=[1 -1]_C $ we have that $ rep{t(vec(e)_2)}{stdbasis(_2)} =([ 2 -1 0 0 ])_{C,stdbasis(_2)} [1 -1]_C =[3 0]_{stdbasis(_2)} $ and consequently we know that $t(vec(e)_2)=3·vec(e)_1$ (since, with respect to the standard basis, this vector is represented by itself). Therefore, this is the representation of $t$ with respect to $stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)$. $ Representation of (t) =([ -1 3 0 0 ])_{stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)} $ To use the matrix developed in the prior item, note that $ Representation of ([0 5])=[0 5]_{stdbasis(_2)} $ and so we have this is the representation, with respect to the codomain's basis, of the image of the given vector. $ Representation of (t([0 5])) =([ -1 3 0 0 ])_{stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)} [0 5]_{stdbasis(_2)} =[15 0]_{stdbasis(_2)} $ Because the codomain's basis is the standard one, and so vectors in the codomain are represented by themselves, we have this. $ t([0 5]) =[15 0] $ We first find the image of each member of $ B $, and then represent those images with respect to $ D $. For the first step, we can use the matrix developed earlier. $ Representation of ([1 -1]) =([ -1 3 0 0 ])_{stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)} [1 -1]_{stdbasis(_2)} =[-4 0]_{stdbasis(_2)} so t([1 -1])=[-4 0] $ Actually, for the second member of $B$ there is no need to apply the matrix because the problem statement gives its image. $ t([1 1])=[2 0] $ Now representing those images with respect to $D$ is routine. $ Representation of ([-4 0])=[-1 2]_D and Representation of ([2 0])=[1/2 -1]_D $ Thus, the matrix is this. $ Representation of (t)= ([ -1 1/2 2 -1 ])_{B,D} $ We know the images of the members of the domain's basis from the prior item. $ t([1 -1])=[-4 0]  t([1 1])=[2 0] $ We can compute the representation of those images with respect to the codomain's basis. $ Representation of ([-4 0])=[-2 -2]_B and Representation of ([2 0])=[1 1]_B $ Thus this is the matrix. $ Representation of (t)= ([ -2 1 -2 1 ])_{B,B} $    Suppose that $ h: V → W $ is one-to-one so that by , for any basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n}⊆ V $ the image $ h(B)=sequence{h(vec(β)_1),...,h(vec(β)_n)} $ is a basis for $ W $.  Represent the map $h$ with respect to $B,h(B)$. For a member $vec(v)$ of the domain, where the representation of $vec(v)$ has components $c_1$, ..., $c_n$, represent the image vector $ h(vec(v)) $ with respect to the image basis $h(B)$.    The images of the members of the domain's basis are $ vec(β)_1↦ h(vec(β)_1)  vec(β)_2↦ h(vec(β)_2) ... vec(β)_n↦ h(vec(β)_n) $ and those images are represented with respect to the codomain's basis in this way. $ rep{h(vec(β)_1)}{h(B)}=[1 0 ... 0]  rep{h(vec(β)_2)}{h(B)}=[0 1 ... 0] ... rep{h(vec(β)_n)}{h(B)}=[0 0 ... 1] $ Hence, the matrix is the identity. $ Representation of (h) =([ 1 0 ... 0 0 1 0 ... 0 0 1 ]) $ Using the matrix in the prior item, the representation is this. $ rep{h(vec(v))}{h(B)} =[c_1 ... c_n]_{h(B)} $    Give a formula for the product of a matrix and $ vec(e)_i $, the column vector that is all zeroes except for a single one in the $ i $-th position.  The product $ ([ h_{1,1} ... h_{1,i} ... h_{1,n} h_{2,1} ... h_{2,i} ... h_{2,n} ... h_{m,1} ... h_{m,i} ... h_{1,n} ]) [0 ... 1 ... 0] = [h_{1,i] h_{2,i} ... h_{m,i}} $ gives the $ i $-th column of the matrix.   For each vector space of functions of one real variable, represent the derivative transformation with respect to $ B,B $.  $ {acos(x+b)sin(x) such that a,b in ℝ} $, $ B=cos(x),sin(x) $ $ {ae^x+be^{{2x} such that a,b in ℝ} $, $ B=sequence{e^x,e^{2x}} $ $ {a+bx+ce^x+dxe^{{x} such that a,b,c,d in ℝ} $, $ B=sequence{1,x,e^x,xe^{x}} $    The images of the basis vectors for the domain are $ cos(xd/dx) ↓-sin(x) $ and $ sin(xd/dx) ↓cos(x) $. Representing those with respect to the codomain's basis (again, $B$) and adjoining the representations gives this matrix. $ (d/dx){B,B}= ([ 0 1 -1 0 ])_{B,B} $ The images of the vectors in the domain's basis are $ e^xd/dx ↓e^x $ and $ e^{2x}d/dx ↓2e^{2x} $. Representing with respect to the codomain's basis and adjoining gives this matrix. $ (d/dx){B,B}= ([ 1 0 0 2 ])_{B,B} $ The images of the members of the domain's basis are $ 1d/dx ↓0 $, $ xd/dx ↓1 $, $ e^{x}d/dx ↓e^{x} $, and $ xe^{x}d/dx ↓e^x+xe^x $. Representing these images with respect to $B$ and adjoining gives this matrix. $ (d/dx){B,B}= ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 ])_{B,B} $    Find the range of the linear transformation of $ ℝ^2 $ represented with respect to the standard bases by each matrix.  $([ 1 0 0 0 ])$ $([ 0 0 3 2 ])$ a matrix of the form $([ a b 2a 2b ])$    It is the set of vectors of the codomain represented with respect to the codomain's basis in this way. $ { ([ 1 0 0 0 ]) [x y] such that x,y in ℝ} ={[x 0] such that x,y in ℝ} $ As the codomain's basis is $stdbasis(_2)$, and so each vector is represented by itself, the range of this transformation is the $x$-axis. It is the set of vectors of the codomain represented in this way. $ { ([ 0 0 3 2 ]) [x y] such that x,y in ℝ} ={[0 3x+2y] such that x,y in ℝ} $ With respect to $stdbasis(_2)$ vectors represent themselves so this range is the $y$~axis. The set of vectors represented with respect to $stdbasis(_2)$ as $ { ([ a b 2a 2b ]) [x y] such that x,y in ℝ} ={[ax+by 2ax+2by] such that x,y in ℝ} ={(ax+by)·[1 2] such that x,y in ℝ} $ is the line $y=2x$, provided either $a$ or $b$ is not zero, and is the set consisting of just the origin if both are zero.    Can one matrix represent two different linear maps? That is, can $ Representation of (h)=rep(ĥ){B̂,D̂} $?  Yes, for two reasons.  First, the two maps $h$ and $ĥ$ need not have the same domain and codomain. For instance, $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) $ represents a map $ h: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ with respect to the standard bases that sends $ [1 0]↦[1 3] and [0 1]↦[2 4] $ and also represents a $ map(ĥ){polyspace(_1)}{ ℝ^2} $ with respect to $ 1,x $ and $ stdbasis(_2) $ that acts in this way. $ 1↦[1 3] and x↦[2 4] $  The second reason is that, even if the domain and codomain of $ h $ and $ ĥ $ coincide, different bases produce different maps. An example is the $N by N$ identity matrix $ I=([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ which represents the identity map on $ ℝ^2$ with respect to $stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)$. However, with respect to $stdbasis(_2)$ for the domain but the basis $D=sequence{vec(e)_2,vec(e)_1}$ for the codomain, the same matrix $I$ represents the map that swaps the first and second components $ [x y]↦[y x] $ (that is, reflection about the line $y=x$).   Prove .  We mimic , just replacing the numbers with letters.  Write $ B $ as $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ and $ D $ as $ sequence{vec(δ)_1,...,vec(δ)_m} $. By definition of representation of a map with respect to bases, the assumption that $ Representation of (h) =([ h_{1,1} ... h_{1,n} ... ... h_{m,1} ... h_{m,n} ]) $ means that $h(vec(β)_i)=h_{i,1}vec(δ)_1+...+h_{i,n}vec(δ)_n$. And, by the definition of the representation of a vector with respect to a basis, the assumption that $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=[c_1 ... c_n] $ means that $ vec(v)=c_1vec(β)_1+·s+c_nvec(β)_n $. Substituting gives $ h(vec(v)) =h(c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_n·vec(β)_n) =c_1· h(vec(β)_1)+...+c_n· vec(β)_n =c_1· (h_{1,1}vec(δ)_1+...+h_{m,1}vec(δ)_m) +... +c_n· (h_{1,n}vec(δ)_1+...+h_{m,n}vec(δ)_m) =(h_{1,1}c_1+...+h_{1,n}c_n)·vec(δ)_1 +·s +(h_{m,1}c_1+...+h_{m,n}c_n)·vec(δ)_m $ and so $h(vec(v))$ is represented as required.   shows how to represent rotation of all vectors in the plane through an angle $ θ $ about the origin, with respect to the standard bases.  Rotation of all vectors in three-space through an angle $ θ $ about the $ x $-axis is a transformation of $ ℝ^3$. Represent it with respect to the standard bases. Arrange the rotation so that to someone whose feet are at the origin and whose head is at $ (1,0,0) $, the movement appears clockwise. Repeat the prior item, only rotate about the $ y $-axis instead. (Put the person's head at $vec(e)_2$.) Repeat, about the $ z $-axis. Extend the prior item to $ ℝ^4 $. (Hint: we can restate `rotate about the $ z $-axis' as `rotate parallel to the $ xy $-plane'.)    The picture is this.    The images of the vectors from the domain's basis $ [1 0 0]↦[1 0 0]  [0 1 0]↦[0 cosθ - sinθ]  [0 0 1]↦[0 sinθ cosθ] $ are represented with respect to the codomain's basis (again, $stdbasis(_3)$) by themselves, so adjoining the representations to make the matrix gives this. $ Representation of (r_θ)= ([ 1 0 0 0 cos(θ) sin(θ) 0 -sin(θ) cos(θ) ]) $ The picture is similar to the one in the prior answer. The images of the vectors from the domain's basis $ [1 0 0]↦[ cosθ 0 sinθ]  [0 1 0]↦[0 1 0]  [0 0 1]↦[- sinθ 0 cosθ] $ are represented with respect to the codomain's basis $stdbasis(_3)$ by themselves, so this is the matrix. $ ([ cos(θ) 0 -sin(θ) 0 1 0 sin(θ) 0 cos(θ) ]) $ To a person standing up, with the vertical $z$-axis, a rotation of the $xy$-plane that is clockwise proceeds from the positive $y$-axis to the positive $x$-axis. That is, it rotates opposite to the direction in . The images of the vectors from the domain's basis $ [1 0 0]↦[ cosθ - sinθ 0]  [0 1 0]↦[ sinθ cosθ 0]  [0 0 1]↦[0 0 1] $ are represented with respect to $stdbasis(_3)$ by themselves, so the matrix is this. $ ([ cos(θ) sin(θ) 0 -sin(θ) cos(θ) 0 0 0 1 ]) $  $([ cos(θ) sin(θ) 0 0 -sin(θ) cos(θ) 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ])$   (Schur's Triangularization Lemma)   Let $ U $ be a subspace of $ V $ and fix bases $ B_U⊆ B_V $. What is the relationship between the representation of a vector from $ U $ with respect to $ B_U $ and the representation of that vector (viewed as a member of $ V $) with respect to $ B_V $? What about maps? Fix a basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ for $ V $ and observe that the spans $ span(mptyset)={0}⊆span({vec{{β)_1}} ⊆span({vec{{β)_1,vec{{β}_2}} ⊆ ·s ⊆span(B)=V $ form a strictly increasing chain of subspaces. Show that for any linear map $ h: V → W $ there is a chain $ W_0={0}⊆ W_1⊆ ... ⊆ W_m =W $ of subspaces of $ W $ such that $ h(span({vec{{β)_1,...,vec{{β}_i}})⊆ W_i $ for each $ i $. Conclude that for every linear map $ h: V → W $ there are bases $ B,D $ so the matrix representing $ h $ with respect to $ B,D $ is upper-triangular (that is, each entry $ h_{i,j} $ with $ i>j $ is zero). Is an upper-triangular representation unique?     Write the basis $ B_U $ as $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_k} $ and then write $B_V$ as the extension $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_k, vec(β)_{k+1},...,vec(β)_n} $. If $ rep{vec(v)}{B_U}=[c_1 ... c_k] $ so that $vec(v)=c_1·vec(β)_1+·s+c_k·vec(β)_k$ then $ rep{vec(v)}{B_V}=[c_1 ... c_k 0 ... 0] $ because $vec(v)=c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_k·vec(β)_k +0·vec(β)_{k+1}+...+0·vec(β)_n$.  We must first decide what the question means. Compare $ h: V → W $ with its restriction to the subspace $ map{restrictionmap(h){U}}{U}{W} $. The range space of the restriction is a subspace of $ W $, so fix a basis $ D_{h(U)} $ for this range space and extend it to a basis $ D_V $ for $ W $. We want the relationship between these two. $ Representation of (h) and rep{restrictionmap(h){U}}{B_U,D_{h(U)}} $ The answer falls right out of the prior item:~if $ rep{restrictionmap(h){U}}{B_U,D_{h(U)}} =([ h_{1,1} ... h_{1,k} ... ... h_{p,1} ... h_{p,k} ]) $ then the extension is represented in this way. $ Representation of (h) =([ h_{1,1} ... h_{1,k} h_{1,k+1} ... h_{1,n} ... ... h_{p,1} ... h_{p,k} h_{p,k+1} ... h_{p,n} 0 ... 0 h_{p+1,k+1} ... h_{p+1,n} ... ... 0 ... 0 h_{m,k+1} ... h_{m,n} ]) $ Take $ W_i $ to be the span of $ {h(vec{{β}_1),...,h(vec{{β}_i)} $. Apply the answer from the second item to the third item. No. For instance $ π_x: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $, projection onto the $ x $~axis, is represented by these two upper-triangular matrices $ Representation of (π_x)= ([ 1 0 0 0 ]) and Representation of (π_x)= ([ 0 1 0 0 ]) $ where $ C=sequence{vec(e)_2,vec(e)_1} $.                       The prior subsection shows that the action of a linear map $h$ is described by a matrix $H$, with respect to appropriate bases, in this way. $ vec(v)=[v_1 ... v_n]_B overset(h){H under ↦} h(vec(v))= [h_{1,1]v_1+...+h_{1,n}v_n ... h_{m,1}v_1+...+h_{m,n}v_n}_D  $ Here we will show the converse, that each matrix represents a linear map.    So we start with a matrix $ H=general_matrix(h, n, m) $ and we will describe how it defines a map~$h$. We require that the map be represented by the matrix so first note that in ($*$) the dimension of the map's domain is the number of columns~$n$ of the matrix and the dimension of the codomain is the number of rows~$m$. Thus, for $h$'s domain fix an $ n $-dimensional vector space $V$ and for the codomain fix an $ m $-dimensional space $W$. Also fix bases $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ and $ D=sequence{vec(δ)_1,...,vec(δ)_m} $ for those spaces.    Now let $ h: V → W $ be:~where $vec(v)$ in the domain has the representation $ rep{vec(v)}{B} =[v_1 ... v_n]_B $ then its image $ h(vec(v)) $ is the member the codomain with this representation. $ rep{h(vec(v))}{D} =[h_{1,1]v_1+...+h_{1,n}v_n ... h_{m,1}v_1+...+h_{m,n}v_n}_D $ That is, to compute the action of $h$ on any $vec(v) in V$, first express $vec(v)$ with respect to the basis $vec(v)=v_1vec(β)_1+...+v_nvec(β)_n$ and then $h(vec(v))= (h_{1,1}v_1+...+h_{1,n}v_n)·vec(δ)_1 +...+ (h_{m,1}v_1+...+h_{m,n}v_n)·vec(δ)_m$.    Above we have made some choices; for instance $V$ can be any $n$-dimensional space and $B$ could be any basis for $V$, so $H$ does not define a unique function. However, note once we have fixed $V$, $B$, $W$, and $D$ then $h$ is well-defined since $vec(v)$ has a unique representation with respect to the basis $B$  and the calculation of $vec(w)$ from its representation is also uniquely determined.   For example Consider this matrix. $ H= ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]) $ It is $N by M$ so any map that it defines must carry a dimension~$2$ domain to a dimension~$3$ codomain. We can choose the domain and codomain to be $ ℝ^2$ and $polyspace(_2)$, with these bases. $ B=[1 1], [1 -1]  D=x^2, x^2+x, x^2+x+1 $ Then let $h: ℝ^2 → polyspace(_2)$ be the function defined by~$H$. We will compute the image under $h$ of this member of the domain. $ vec(v)=[-3 2] $ The computation is straightforward. $ rep{h(vec(v))}{D} =H·rep{vec(v)}{B} = ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]) [-1/2 -5/2] =[-11/2 -23/2 -35/2] $ From its representation, computation of $vec(w)$ is routine $(-11/2)(x^2)-(23/2)(x^2+x)-(35/2)(x^2+x+1) =(-69/2)x^2-(58/2)x-(35/2)$.      Any matrix represents a homomorphism between vector spaces of appropriate dimensions, with respect to any pair of bases.      We must check that for any matrix $H$ and any domain and codomain bases $B,D$, the defined map $ h $ is linear. If $vec(v), vec(u) in V$ are such that $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=[v_1 ... v_n]  rep{vec(u)}{B}=[u_1 ... u_n] $ and $ c,d in ℝ $ then the calculation $ h(cvec(v)+dvec(u)) =[(h_{1,1}(cv_1+du_1)+...+ h_{1,n}(cv_n+du_n)])·vec(δ)_1+ ·s+[(h_{m,1}(cv_1+du_1)+... +h_{m,n}(cv_n+du_n)])·vec(δ)_m =c· h(vec(v))+d· h(vec(u)) $ supplies that check.    For example Even if the domain and codomain are the same, the map that the matrix represents depends on the bases that we choose. If $ H= ([ 1 0 0 0 ]),  B_1=D_1=[1 0],[0 1] , and B_2=D_2=[0 1],[1 0] , $ then $ h_1: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ represented by $ H $ with respect to $ B_1,D_1 $ maps $ [c_1 c_2] =[c_1 c_2]_{B_1}  ↦  [c_1 0]_{D_1} = [c_1 0] $ while $ h_2: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ represented by $ H $ with respect to $ B_2,D_2 $ is this map. $ [c_1 c_2] =[c_2 c_1]_{B_2}  ↦  [c_2 0]_{D_2} = [0 c_2] $ These are different functions. The first is projection onto the $ x $-axis while the second is projection onto the $y$-axis.     This result means that when convenient we can work solely with matrices, just doing the computations without having to worry whether a matrix of interest represents a linear map on some pair of spaces.  When we are working with a matrix but we do not have particular spaces or bases in mind then we can take the domain and codomain to be $ ℝ^n$ and $ ℝ^m$, with the standard bases. This is convenient because with the standard bases vector representation is transparent- the representation of $vec(v)$ is $vec(v)$. (In this case the column space of the matrix equals the range of the map and consequently the column space of $ H $ is often denoted by $ H $.)      Given a matrix, to come up with an associated map we can choose among many domain and codomain spaces, and many bases for those. So a matrix can represent many maps. We finish this section by illustrating how the matrix can give us information about the associated maps.     The rank of a matrix equals the rank of any map that it represents.      Suppose that the matrix $ H $ is $ N by M $. Fix domain and codomain spaces $V$ and $W$ of dimension $n$ and~$m$ with bases $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ and $ D $. Then $ H $ represents some linear map $h$ between those spaces with respect to these bases whose range space $ {h(vec{{v}) such that vec{{v} in V} ={h(c_1vec{{β}_1+...+c_nvec{{β}_n) such that c_1,...,c_n in ℝ} ={c_1h(vec{{β}_1)+...+c_nh(vec{{β}_n) such that c_1,...,c_n in ℝ} $ is the span $span({h(vec{{β)_1),...,h(vec{{β}_n)}}$. The rank of the map $h$ is the dimension of this range space.    The rank of the matrix is the dimension of its column space, the span of the set of its columns $span({rep{{h(vec{{β)_1)}{{D},...,rep{{h(vec{{β}_n)}{{D}}}$.    To see that the two spans have the same dimension, recall from the proof of Lemma~I. that if we fix a basis then representation with respect to that basis gives an isomorphism $Rep_D: W → ℝ^m$. Under this isomorphism there is a linear relationship among members of the range space if and only if the same relationship holds in the column space, e.g, $0=c_1· h(vec(β)_1)+...+c_n· h(vec(β)_n)$ if and only if $0=c_1·rep{h(vec(β)_1)}{D}+...+c_n·rep{h(vec(β)_n)}{D}$. Hence, a subset of the range space is linearly independent if and only if the corresponding subset of the column space is linearly independent. Therefore the size of the largest linearly independent subset of the range space equals the size of the largest linearly independent subset of the column space, and so the two spaces have the same dimension.    That settles the apparent ambiguity in our use of the same word `rank' to apply both to matrices and to maps.  For example Any map represented by $ ([ 1 2 2 1 2 1 0 0 3 0 0 2 ]) $ must have three-dimensional domain and a four-dimensional codomain. In addition, because the rank of this matrix is two (we can spot this by eye or get it with Gauss's Method), any map represented by this matrix has a two-dimensional range space.     Let $h$ be a linear map represented by a matrix $H$. Then $h$ is onto if and only if the rank of $H$ equals the number of its rows, and $h$ is one-to-one if and only if the rank of $H$ equals the number of its columns.      For the onto half, the dimension of the range space of $h$ is the rank of $h$, which equals the rank of $H$ by the theorem. Since the dimension of the codomain of $h$ equals the number of rows in $H$, if the rank of $H$ equals the number of rows then the dimension of the range space equals the dimension of the codomain. But a subspace with the same dimension as its superspace must equal that superspace (because any basis for the range space is a linearly independent subset of the codomain whose size is equal to the dimension of the codomain, and thus so this basis for the range space must also be a basis for the codomain).    For the other half, a linear map is one-to-one if and only if it is an isomorphism between its domain and its range, that is, if and only if its domain has the same dimension as its range. The number of columns in $H$ is the dimension of $h$'s domain and by the theorem the rank of $H$ equals the dimension of $h$'s range.      A linear map that is one-to-one and onto is nonsingular , otherwise it is singular . That is, a linear map is nonsingular if and only if it is an isomorphism.     Some authors use `nonsingular' as a synonym for one-to-one while others use it the way that we have here. The difference is slight because any map is onto its range space, so a one-to-one map is an isomorphism with its range.   In the first chapter we defined a matrix to be nonsingular if it is square and is the matrix of coefficients of a linear system with a unique solution. The next result justifies our dual use of the term.      A nonsingular linear map is represented by a square matrix. A square matrix represents nonsingular maps if and only if it is a nonsingular matrix. Thus, a matrix represents isomorphisms if and only if it is square and nonsingular.      Assume that the map $h: V → W$ is nonsingular. says that for any matrix $H$ representing that map, because $h$ is onto the number of rows of $H$ equals the rank of $H$, and because $h$ is one-to-one the number of columns of~$H$ is also equal to the rank of~$H$. Hence $H$ is square.    Next assume that $H$ is square, $N by N$. The matrix~$H$ is nonsingular if and only if its row rank is~$n$, which is true if and only if $H$'s rank is~$n$ by Theorem~Two.III., which is true if and only if $h$'s rank is~$n$ by , which is true if and only if $h$ is an isomorphism by Theorem~I.. (This last holds because the domain of $h$ is $n$-dimensional as it is the number of columns in $H$.)     For example Any map from $ ℝ^2 $ to $ polyspace(_1) $ represented with respect to any pair of bases by $ ([ 1 2 0 3 ]) $ is nonsingular because this matrix has rank two.   For example Any map $ g: V → W $ represented by $ ([ 1 2 3 6 ]) $ is singular because this matrix is singular.   We've now seen that the relationship between maps and matrices goes both ways:~for a particular pair of bases, any linear map is represented by a matrix and any matrix describes a linear map. That is, by fixing spaces and bases we get a correspondence between maps and matrices. In the rest of this chapter we will explore this correspondence. For instance, we've defined for linear maps the operations of addition and scalar multiplication and we shall see what the corresponding matrix operations are. We shall also see the matrix operation that represent the map operation of composition. And, we shall see how to find the matrix that represents a map's inverse.     Let $h$ be the linear map defined by this matrix on the domain~$polyspace(_1)$ and codomain~$ ℝ^2$ with respect to the given bases. $ H= ([ 2 1 4 2 ])  B=1+x,x, D=[1 1],[1 0] $ What is the image under $h$ of the vector $vec(v)=2x-1$?  With respect to $B$ the vector's representation is this. $ Representation of (2x-1)=[-1 3] $ Using the matrix-vector product we can compute $rep{h(vec(v))}{D}$ $ Representation of (h(2x-1)) = ([ 2 1 4 2 ]) [-1 3]_B = [1 2]_D $ From that representation we can compute $h(vec(v))$. $ h(2x-1)=1·[1 1]+2·[1 0] =[3 1] $   Decide if each vector lies in the range of the map from $ ℝ^3 $ to $ ℝ^2 $ represented with respect to the standard bases by the matrix.  $ ([ 1 1 3 0 1 4 ]) $,~$ [1 3] $ $ ([ 2 0 3 4 0 6 ]) $,~$ [1 1] $   As described in the subsection, with respect to the standard bases, representations are transparent, and so, for instance, the first matrix describes this map. $ [1 0 0]=[1 0 0]_{stdbasis(_3)} ↦[1 0]_{stdbasis(_2)}=[1 0]    [0 1 0] ↦[1 1]    [0 0 1] ↦[3 4] $ So, for this first one, we are asking whether there are scalars such that $ c_1[1 0]+c_2[1 1] +c_3[3 4]=[1 3] $ that is, whether the vector is in the column space of the matrix.  Yes. We can get this conclusion by setting up the resulting linear system and applying Gauss's Method, as usual. Another way to get it is to note by inspection of the equation of columns that taking $c_3=3/4$, and $c_1=-5/4$, and $c_2=0$ will do. Still a third way to get this conclusion is to note that the rank of the matrix is two, which equals the dimension of the codomain, and so the map is onto- the range is all of $ ℝ^2$ and in particular includes the given vector. No; note that all of the columns in the matrix have a second component that is twice the first, while the vector does not. Alternatively, the column space of the matrix is $ {c_1[2 4] +c_2[0 0] +c_3[3 6] such that c_1,c_2,c_3 in ℝ} ={c[1 2] such that c in ℝ} $ (which is the fact already noted, but we got it by calculation rather than inspiration), and the given vector is not in this set.    Consider this matrix, representing a transformation of $ ℝ^2$, and these bases for that space. $ (1/2)· ([ 1 1 -1 1 ])  B=[0 1],[1 0]  D=[1 1],[1 -1] $  To what vector in the codomain is the first member of $B$ mapped? The second member? Where is a general vector from the domain (a vector with components $x$ and $y$) mapped? That is, what transformation of $ ℝ^2 $ is represented with respect to $ B,D $ by this matrix?    The first member of the basis $ [0 1]=[1 0]_B $ maps to $ [1/2 -1/2]_D $ which is this member of the codomain. $ (1/2)·[1 1] -(1/2)·[1 -1] =[0 1] $ The second member of the basis maps $ [1 0]=[0 1]_B ↦ [(1/2 1/2]_D $ to this member of the codomain. $ (1/2)·[1 1] +(1/2)·[1 -1] =[1 0] $ Because the map that the matrix represents is the identity map on the basis, it must be the identity on all members of the domain. We can come to the same conclusion in another way by considering $ [x y]=[y x]_B $ which maps to $ [(x+y)/2 (x-y)/2]_D $ which represents this member of $ ℝ^2$. $ (x+y/2)·[1 1] +(x-y/2)·[1 -1] =[x y] $    What transformation of $ F={acos(θ+b)sin(θ) such that a,b in ℝ} $ is represented with respect to $ B=cos(θ-)sin(θ),sin(θ) $ and $ D=cos(θ+)sin(θ),cos(θ) $ by this matrix? $ ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $  A general member of the domain, represented with respect to the domain's basis as $ acos(θ+b)sin(θ)=[a a+b]_B $ maps to $ [0 a]_D representing 0·(cos(θ+)sin(θ))+a·(cos(θ)) $ and so the linear map represented by the matrix with respect to these bases $ acos(θ+b)sin(θ) ↦ acos(θ) $ is projection onto the first component.   Decide whether $1+2x$ is in the range of the map from $ ℝ^3$ to $polyspace(_2)$ represented with respect to $stdbasis(_3)$ and $1,1+x^2,x$ by this matrix. $ ([ 1 3 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]) $  Denote the given basis of $polyspace(_2)$ by $B$. Application of the linear map is represented by matrix-vector multiplication. Thus the first vector in $stdbasis(_3)$ maps to the element of $polyspace(_2)$ represented with respect to~$B$ by $ ([ 1 3 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]) [1 0 0] = [1 0 1] $ and that element is $1+x$. Calculate the other two images of basis vectors in the same way. $ ([ 1 3 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]) [0 1 0] = [3 1 0]=Representation of (4+x^2)  ([ 1 3 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]) [0 0 1] = [0 0 1]=Representation of (x) $ So the range of $h$ is the span of three polynomials $1+x$, $4+x^2$, and $x$. We can thus decide if $1+2x$ is in the range of the map by looking for scalars $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$ such that $ c_1·(1+x)+c_2·(4+x^2)+c_3·(x)=1+2x $ and obviously $c_1=1$, $c_2=0$, and $c_3=1$ suffice. Thus $1+2x$ is in the range, since it is the image of this vector. $ 1·[1 0 0]+0·[0 1 0] +1·[0 0 1] $  Comment. A slicker argument is to note that the matrix is nonsingular, so it has rank~$3$, so the range has dimension~$3$, and since the codomain has dimension~$3$ the map is onto. Thus every polynomial is the image of some vector and in particular~$1+2x$ is the image of a vector in the domain.   gives a matrix that is nonsingular and is therefore associated with maps that are nonsingular.  Find the set of column vectors representing the members of the null space of any map represented by this matrix. Find the nullity of any such map. Find the set of column vectors representing the members of the range space of any map represented by this matrix. Find the rank of any such map. Check that rank plus nullity equals the dimension of the domain.   Let the matrix be $G$, and suppose that it represents $g: V → W$ with respect to bases $B$ and $D$. Because $G$ has two columns, $V$ is two-dimensional. Because $G$ has two rows, $W$ is two-dimensional. The action of $g$ on a general member of the domain is this. $ [x y]_B ↦ [x+2y 3x+6y]_D $  The only representation of the zero vector in the codomain is $ Representation of (0)=[0 0]_D $ and so the set of representations of members of the null space is this. $ {[x y]_B such that {$x+2y=0$ and $3x+6y=0$} ={y·[-1/2 1]_D such that y in ℝ} $ The representation map $Rep_D: W → ℝ^2$ and its inverse are isomorphisms, and so preserve the dimension of subspaces. The subspace of $ ℝ^2$ that is in the prior item is one-dimensional. Therefore, the image of that subspace under the inverse of the representation map- the null space of $G$, is also one-dimensional. The set of representations of members of the range space is this. $ {[x+2y 3x+6y]_D such that x,y in ℝ} ={k·[1 3]_D such that k in ℝ} $ Of course, gives that the rank of the map equals the rank of the matrix, which is one. Alternatively, the same argument that we used above for the null space gives here that the dimension of the range space is one. One plus one equals two.    Take each matrix to represent $h: ℝ^m → ℝ^n$ with respect to the standard bases. For each (i)~state $m$ and~$n$. Then set up an augmented matrix with the given matrix on the left and a vector representing a range space element on the right (e.g., if the codomain is~$ ℝ^3$ then in the right-hand column put the three entries $a$, $b$, and $c$). Perform Gauss-Jordan reduction. Use that to (ii)~find $h$ and $rank(h)$ (and state whether the underlying map is onto), and (iii)~find $νllspace{h}$ and $νllity(h)$ (and state whether the underlying map is one-to-one).  $ ([ 2 1 -1 3 ])$  $([ 0 1 3 2 3 4 -2 -1 2 ])$  $([ 1 1 2 1 3 1 ])$     (i)~The dimension of the domain space is the number of columns~$m=2$. The dimension of the codomain space is the number of rows~$n=2$.  For the rest, we consider this matrix-vector equation. $ ([ 2 1 -1 3 ]) [x y] = [a b]  $ We solve for $x$ and~$y$. $ ([ 2 1 a -1 3 b ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ for step $-(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 (3/7)a-(1/7)b 0 1 (1/7)a+(2/7)b ]) $ (ii)~For all $ [a b] in ℝ^2 $ in equation~($*$) the system has a solution, by the calculation. So the range space is all of the codomain~$h= ℝ^2$. The map's rank is the dimension of the range,~$2$. The map is onto because the range space is all of the codomain.  (iii)~Again by the calculation, to find the nullspace, setting $a=b=0$ in equation~($*$) gives that $x=y=0$. The null space is the trivial subspace of the domain. $ νllspace{h}={[0 0]} $ The nullity is the dimension of that null space,~$0$. The map is one-to-one because the null space is trivial.  (i)~The dimension of the domain space is the number of matrix columns,~$m=3$, and the dimension of the codomain space is the number of rows,~$n=3$.  The calculation is this. $ ([ 0 1 3 a 2 3 4 b -2 -1 2 c ]) for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ for step $ρ_1+ρ_3$ for step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ for step $-(3/2)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 -5/2 -(3/2)a+(1/2)b 0 1 3 a 0 0 0 -2a+b+c ]) $ (ii)~There are codomain triples $ [a b c] in ℝ^3 $ for which the system does not have a solution, specifically the system only has a solution if $-2a+b+c=0$. $ h={[a b c] such that a=(b+c)/2} ={[1/2 1 0]b +[1/2 0 1]c such that b,c in ℝ} $ The map's rank is the range's dimension,~$2$. The map is not onto because the range space is not all of the codomain.  (iii)~Setting $a=b=c=0$ in the calculation gives infinitely many solutions. Paramatrizing using the free variable~$z$ leads to this description of the nullspace. $ νllspace{h}={[x y z] such that $y=-3z$ and $x=(5/2)z$} ={[5/2 -3 1]z such that z in ℝ} $ The nullity is the dimension of that null space,~$1$. The map is not one-to-one because the null space is not trivial.  (i)~The domain has dimension $m=2$ while the codomain has dimension~$n=3$. Here is the calculation. $ ([ 1 1 a 2 1 b 3 1 c ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ for step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ for step $-ρ_2$ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 -a+b 0 1 2a-b 0 0 a-2b+c ]) $  (ii)~The range is this subspace of the codomain. $ h={[2b-c b c] such that b,c in ℝ} ={[2 1 0]b+[-1 0 1]c such that b,c in ℝ} $ The rank is~$2$. The map is not onto.  (iii)~The null space is the trivial subspace of the domain. $ νllspace{h}={[x y]=[0 0]} $ The nullity is~$0$. The map is one-to-one.   Use the method from the prior exercise on each.   $([ 1 0 -1 2 1 0 2 2 2 ])$ Verify that the map represented by this matrix is an isomorphism. $ ([ 2 1 0 3 1 1 7 2 1 ]) $     Here is the Gauss-Jordan reduction. $ ([ 1 0 -1 a 2 1 0 b 2 2 2 c ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 -1 a 0 1 2 -2a+b 0 2 4 -2a+c ]) for step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 -1 a 0 1 2 -2a+b 0 0 0 2a-2b+c ]) $ (i)~The dimensions are $m=n=3$. (ii)~The range space is the set containing all of the members of the codomain for which this system has a solution. $ h={[b-(1/2)c b c] such that b,c in ℝ} $ The rank is 2. Because the rank is less than the dimension~$n=3$ of the codomain, the map is not onto.  (iii)~The null space is the set of members of the domain that map to $a=0$, $b=0$, and~$c=0$. $ νllspace{h}={[z -2z z] such that z in ℝ} $ The nullity is~$1$. Because the nullity is not~$0$ the map is not one-to-one. Here, (i)~the domain and codomain are each of dimension~$3$. To show (ii) and~(iii), that the map is an isomorphism, we must show it is both onto and one-to-one. For that we don't need to augment the matrix with $a$, $b$, and~$c$; this calculation $ ([ 2 1 0 3 1 1 7 2 1 ]) for step $-(3/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ for step $-3ρ_2+ρ_3$ for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ for step $2ρ_3+ρ_2$ for step $-(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $ gives that for each codomain vector there is one and only one associated domain vector.   This is an alternative proof of . Given an $N by N$ matrix $H$, fix a domain~$V$ and codomain~$W$ of appropriate dimension~$n$, and bases $B,D$ for those spaces, and consider the map~$h$ represented by the matrix.   Show that $h$ is onto if and only if there is at least one $rep{vec(v)}{B}$ associated by $H$ with each $rep{vec(w)}{D}$.  Show that $h$ is one-to-one if and only if there is at most one $rep{vec(v)}{B}$ associated by $H$ with each $rep{vec(w)}{D}$.  Consider the linear system $H·rep{vec(v)}{B}=rep{vec(w)}{D}$. Show that $H$ is nonsingular if and only if there is exactly one solution~$rep{vec(v)}{B}$ for each $rep{vec(w)}{D}$.     The defined map $h$ is onto if and only if for every $vec(w) in W$ there is a $vec(v) in V$ such that $h(vec(v))=vec(w)$. Since for every vector there is exactly one representation, converting to representations gives that $h$ is onto if and only if for every representation $rep{vec(w)}{D}$ there is a representation $rep{vec(v)}{B}$ such that $H·rep{vec(v)}{B}=rep{vec(w)}{D}$.  This is just like the prior part.  As described at the start of this subsection, by definition the map $h$ defined by the matrix $H$ associates this domain vector $vec(v)$ with this codomain vector $vec(w)$. $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=[v_1 ... v_n]  rep{vec(w)}{D} = H·rep{vec(v)}{B} =[h_{1,1]v_1+...+h_{1,n}v_n ... h_{m,1}v_1+...+h_{m,n}v_n} $ Fix $vec(w) in W$ and consider the linear system defined by the above equation. $   $ h_{1,1}v_1 + ·s + h_{1,n}v_n = w_1 h_{2,1}v_1 + ·s + h_{2,n}v_n = w_2 ... h_{n,1}v_1 + ·s + h_{n,n}v_n = w_n $ $ (Again, here the $w_i$ are fixed and the $v_j$ are unknowns.) Now, $H$ is nonsingular if and only if for all $w_1$, ..., $w_n$ this system has a solution and the solution is unique. By the first two parts of this exercise this is true if and only if the map $h$ is onto and one-to-one. This in turn is true if and only if $h$ is an isomorphism.    Because the rank of a matrix equals the rank of any map it represents, if one matrix represents two different maps $ H=Representation of (h)=rep(ĥ){B̂,D̂} $ (where $ map(h,ĥ){V}{W} $) then the dimension of the range space of $ h $ equals the dimension of the range space of $ ĥ $. Must these equal-dimensioned range spaces actually be the same?  No, the range spaces may differ. shows this.   Let $ V $ be an $ n $-dimensional space with bases $ B $ and $ D $. Consider a map that sends, for $ vec(v) in V$, the column vector representing $ vec(v) $ with respect to $ B $ to the column vector representing $ vec(v) $ with respect to $ D $. Show that map is a linear transformation of $ ℝ^n $.  Recall that the representation map $ Vmapsunder{Rep_{B}} ℝ^n $ is an isomorphism. Thus, its inverse map $map{Rep_B^{-1}}{ ℝ^n}{V}$ is also an isomorphism. The desired transformation of $ ℝ^n$ is then this composition. $ ℝ^nmapsunder{Rep_{B}^{-1}} Vmapsunder{Rep_{D}} ℝ^n $ Because a composition of isomorphisms is also an isomorphism, this map $∘{Rep_{D}}{Rep_{B}^{-1}}$ is an isomorphism.   shows that changing the pair of bases can change the map that a matrix represents, even though the domain and codomain remain the same. Could the map ever not change? Is there a matrix $ H $, vector spaces $ V $ and $ W $, and associated pairs of bases $ B_1,D_1 $ and $ B_2,D_2 $ (with $ B_1 ≠ B_2 $ or $ D_1 ≠ D_2 $ or both) such that the map represented by $ H $ with respect to $ B_1,D_1 $ equals the map represented by $ H $ with respect to $ B_2,D_2 $?  Yes. Consider $ H=([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ representing a map from $ ℝ^2 $ to $ ℝ^2 $. With respect to the standard bases $ B_1=stdbasis(_2), D_1=stdbasis(_2) $ this matrix represents the identity map. With respect to $ B_2=D_2=[1 1],[1 -1] $ this matrix again represents the identity. In fact, as long as the starting and ending bases are equal- as long as $ B_i=D_i $- then the map represented by $H$ is the identity.   A square matrix is a diagonal matrix if it is all zeroes except possibly for the entries on its upper-left to lower-right diagonal- its $ 1,1 $ entry, its $ 2,2 $ entry, etc. Show that a linear map is an isomorphism if there are bases such that, with respect to those bases, the map is represented by a diagonal matrix with no zeroes on the diagonal.  This is immediate from .   Describe geometrically the action on $ ℝ^2 $ of the map represented with respect to the standard bases $stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)$ by this matrix. $ ([ 3 0 0 2 ]) $ Do the same for these. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 ])  ([ 0 1 1 0 ])  ([ 1 3 0 1 ]) $  The first map $ [x y]=[x y]_{stdbasis(_2)} ↦ [3x 2y]_{stdbasis(_2)}=[3x 2y] $ stretches vectors by a factor of three in the $ x $~direction and by a factor of two in the $ y $~direction. The second map $ [x y]=[x y]_{stdbasis(_2)} ↦ [x 0]_{stdbasis(_2)}=[x 0] $ projects vectors onto the $ x $~axis. The third $ [x y]=[x y]_{stdbasis(_2)} ↦ [y x]_{stdbasis(_2)}=[y x] $ interchanges first and second components (that is, it is a reflection about the line $ y=x $). The last $ [x y]=[x y]_{stdbasis(_2)} ↦ [x+3y y]_{stdbasis(_2)}=[x+3y y] $ stretches vectors parallel to the $ y $~axis, by an amount equal to three times their distance from that axis (this is a skew.)   The fact that for any linear map the rank plus the nullity equals the dimension of the domain shows that a necessary condition for the existence of a homomorphism between two spaces, onto the second space, is that there be no gain in dimension. That is, where $h: V → W$ is onto, the dimension of $W$ must be less than or equal to the dimension of $V$.  Show that this (strong) converse holds: no gain in dimension implies that there is a homomorphism and, further, any matrix with the correct size and correct rank represents such a map. Are there bases for $ ℝ^3$ such that this matrix $ H=([ 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $ represents a map from $ ℝ^3$ to $ ℝ^3$ whose range is the $xy$~plane subspace of $ ℝ^3$?    This is immediate from . Yes. This is immediate from the prior item.  To give a specific example, we can start with $stdbasis(_3)$ as the basis for the domain, and then we require a basis $D$ for the codomain $ ℝ^3$. The matrix $H$ gives the action of the map as this $ [1 0 0]=[1 0 0]_{stdbasis(_3)} ↦[1 2 0]_D  [0 1 0]=[0 1 0]_{stdbasis(_3)} ↦[0 0 1]_D  [0 0 1]=[0 0 1]_{stdbasis(_3)} ↦[0 0 0]_D $ and there is no harm in finding a basis $D$ so that $ Representation of ([1 0 0])=[1 2 0]_D and Representation of ([0 1 0])=[0 0 1]_D $ that is, so that the map represented by $H$ with respect to $stdbasis(_3),D$ is projection down onto the $xy$~plane. The second condition gives that the third member of $D$ is $vec(e)_2$. The first condition gives that the first member of $D$ plus twice the second equals $vec(e)_1$, and so this basis will do. $ D=sequence{[0 -1 0], [1/2 1/2 0], [0 1 0]} $    Let $ V $ be an $ n $-dimensional space and suppose that $ vec(x) in ℝ^n $. Fix a basis $ B $ for $ V $ and consider the map $ map{h_{vec(x)}}{V}{ ℝ} $ given $vec(v)↦vec(x)dot product of rep{vec(v)}{B}$ by the dot product.  Show that this map is linear. Show that for any linear map $ g: V → ℝ $ there is an $ vec(x) in ℝ^n $ such that $ g=h_{vec(x)} $. In the prior item we fixed the basis and varied the $ vec(x) $ to get all possible linear maps. Can we get all possible linear maps by fixing an $ vec(x) $ and varying the basis?    Recall that the representation map $map{Rep_{B}}{V}{ ℝ^n}$ is linear (it is actually an isomorphism, but we do not need that it is one-to-one or onto here). Considering the column vector $x$ to be a $N by M$ matrix gives that the map from $ ℝ^n$ to $ ℝ$ that takes a column vector to its dot product with $vec(x)$ is linear (this is a matrix-vector product and so applies). Thus the map under consideration $h_{vec(x)}$ is linear because it is the composition of two linear maps. $ vec(v)↦ rep{vec(v)}{B} ↦ vec(x)·rep{vec(v)}{B} $ Any linear map $g: V → ℝ$ is represented by some matrix $ ([ g_1 g_2 ·s g_n ]) $ (the matrix has $n$ columns because $V$ is $n$-dimensional and it has only one row because $ ℝ$ is one-dimensional). Then taking $vec(x)$ to be the column vector that is the transpose of this matrix $ vec(x)=[g_1 ... g_n] $ has the desired action. $ vec(v)=[v_1 ... v_n] ↦ [g_1 ... g_n]dot product of [v_1 ... v_n] =g_1v_1+...+g_nv_n $ No. If $ vec(x) $ has any nonzero entries then $ h_{vec(x)} $ cannot be the zero map (and if $ vec(x) $ is the zero vector then $ h_{vec(x)} $ can only be the zero map).    Let $ V,W,X $ be vector spaces with bases $ B,C,D $.  Suppose that $ h: V → W $ is represented with respect to $ B,C $ by the matrix $ H $. Give the matrix representing the scalar multiple $ rh $ (where $ r in ℝ $) with respect to $ B,C $ by expressing it in terms of $ H $. Suppose that $ h,g: V → W $ are represented with respect to $ B,C $ by $ H $ and $ G $. Give the matrix representing $ h+g $ with respect to $ B,C $ by expressing it in terms of $ H $ and $ G $. Suppose that $ h: V → W $ is represented with respect to $ B,C $ by $ H $ and $ g: W → X $ is represented with respect to $ C,D $ by $ G $. Give the matrix representing $ ∘{g}{h} $ with respect to $ B,D $ by expressing it in terms of $ H $ and $ G $.   See the following section.         The prior section shows how matrices represent linear maps. We now explore how this representation interacts with things that we already know. First we will see how the representation of a scalar product $r· f$ of a linear map relates to the representation of $f$, and also how the representation of a sum $f+g$ relates to the representations of the two summands. Later we will do the same comparison for the map operations of composition and inverse.       For example Let $ f: V → W $ be a linear function represented with respect to some bases by this matrix. $ Representation of (f) = ([ 1 0 1 1 ]) $ Consider the map that is the scalar multiple $5f: V → W$. We will relate the representation $Representation of (5f)$ with $Representation of (f)$.  Let $f$ associate $vec(v)↦ vec(w)$ with these representations. $ rep{vec(v)}{B} =[v_1 v_2]  rep{vec(w)}{D} =[w_1 w_2] $ Where the codomain's basis is $D=sequence{vec(δ)_1,vec(δ)_2}$, that representation gives that the output vector is $vec(w)=w_1vec(δ)_1+w_2vec(δ)_2$.  The action of the map $5f$ is $vec(v)↦ 5vec(w)$ and $5vec(w)=5·(w_1vec(δ)_1+w_2vec(δ)_2) =(5w_1)vec(δ)_1+(5w_2)vec(δ)_2$. So $5f$ associates the input vector $vec(v)$ with the output vector having this representation. $ rep{5vec(w)}{D} =[5w_1 5w_2] $ Changing from the map $f$ to the map $5f$ has the effect on the representation of the output vector of multiplying each entry by $5$.  Because of that, $ Representation of (5f) $ is this matrix. $ Representation of (5f)·[v_1 v_2] = [5v_1 5v_1+5v_2]  Representation of (5f) = ([ 5 0 5 5 ]) $ Therefore, going from the matrix representing $f$ to the one representing $5f$ means multiplying all the matrix entries by $5$.   For example We can do a similar exploration for the sum of two maps. Suppose that two linear maps with the same domain and codomain $ f,g: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ are represented with respect to bases $B$ and~$D$ by these matrices. $ Representation of (f)= ([ 1 3 2 0 ])  Representation of (g)= ([ -2 -1 2 4 ]) $ Recall the definition of sum: if $f$~does $vec(v)↦vec(u)$ and $g$~does $vec(v)↦vec(w)$ then $f+g$ is the function whose action is $vec(v)↦vec(u)+vec(w)$. Let these be the representations of the input and output vectors. $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=[v_1 v_2]  rep{vec(u)}{D}=[u_1 u_2]  rep{vec(w)}{D}=[w_1 w_2] $ Where $D=sequence{vec(δ)_1,vec(δ)_2}$ we have $vec(u)+vec(w)=(u_1vec(δ)_1+u_2vec(δ)_2) +(w_1vec(δ)_1+w_2vec(δ)_2) =(u_1+w_1)vec(δ)_1+(u_2+w_2)vec(δ)_2$ and so this is the representation of the vector sum. $ rep{vec(u)+vec(w)}{D}=[u_1+w_1 u_2+w_2] $ Thus, since these represent the actions of of the maps $f$ and~$g$ on the input~$vec(v)$ $ ([ 1 3 2 0 ]) [v_1 v_2] =[v_1+3v_2 2v_1]  ([ -2 -1 2 4 ]) [v_1 v_2] =[-2v_1-v_2 2v_1+4v_2] $ adding the entries represents the action of the map $f+g$. $ Representation of (f+g)·[v_1 v_2] = [-v_1+2v_2 4v_1+4v_2] $ Therefore, we compute the matrix representing the function sum by adding the entries of the matrices representing the functions. $ Representation of (f+g)= ([ -1 2 4 4 ]) $     The scalar multiple of a matrix is the result of entry-by-entry scalar multiplication. The sum of two same-sized matrices is their entry-by-entry sum.    These operations extend the first chapter's operations of addition and scalar multiplication of vectors.  We need a result that proves these matrix operations do what the examples suggest that they do.    Let $ h,g: V → W $ be linear maps represented with respect to bases $ B,D $ by the matrices $ H $ and $ G $ and let $r$ be a scalar. Then with respect to $ B,D $ the map $ r· h: V → W $ is represented by $ rH $ and the map $ h+g: V → W $ is represented by $ H+G $.     Generalize the examples. This is .    These two operations on matrices are simple. But we did not define them in this way because they are simple. We defined them in this way because they represent function addition and function scalar multiplication. That is, our program is to define matrix operations by referencing function operations. Simplicity is a pleasant bonus.                We will see this again in the next subsection, where we will define the operation of multiplying matrices. Since we've just defined matrix scalar multiplication and matrix sum to be entry-by-entry operations, a naive thought is to define matrix multiplication to be the entry-by-entry product. In theory we could do whatever we please but we will instead be practical and combine the entries in the way that represents the function operation of composition.   A special case of scalar multiplication is multiplication by zero. For any map $0· h$ is the zero homomorphism and for any matrix $0· H$ is the matrix with all entries zero.    A zero matrix has all entries $0$. We write $Z_{N by M}$ or simply $Z$ (another common notation is $0_{N by M}$ or just $0$).    For example The zero map from any three-dimensional space to any two-dimensional space is represented by the $ N by M $ zero matrix $ Z=([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ no matter what domain and codomain bases we use.       Perform the indicated operations, if defined.  $ ([ 5 -1 2 6 1 1 ]) + ([ 2 1 4 3 0 5 ]) $ $ 6·([ 2 -1 -1 1 2 3 ]) $ $ ([ 2 1 0 3 ]) + ([ 2 1 0 3 ]) $ $ 4([ 1 2 3 -1 ]) + 5([ -1 4 -2 1 ]) $ $ 3([ 2 1 3 0 ]) +2 ([ 1 1 4 3 0 5 ]) $    $ ([ 7 0 6 9 1 6 ]) $ $ ([ 12 -6 -6 6 12 18 ]) $ $ ([ 4 2 0 6 ]) $ $ ([ -1 28 2 1 ]) $ Not defined.    Prove .  Prove that matrix addition represents addition of linear maps. Prove that matrix scalar multiplication represents scalar multiplication of linear maps.   Represent the domain vector $vec(v) in V$ and the maps $g,h: V → W$ with respect to bases $B,D$ in the usual way.  The representation of $(g+h)(vec(v))=g(vec(v))+h(vec(v))$ $ [( (g_{1,1}v_1+...+g_{1,n}v_n)vec(δ)_1 +·s +(g_{m,1}v_1+...+g_{m,n}v_n)vec(δ)_m ]) +[( (h_{1,1}v_1+·s+h_{1,n}v_n)vec(δ)_1 +·s +(h_{m,1}v_1+...+h_{m,n}v_n)vec(δ)_m ]) $ regroups $ =((g_{1,1}+h_{1,1})v_1+...+ (g_{1,1}+h_{1,n})v_n)·vec(δ)_1 +·s +((g_{m,1}+h_{m,1})v_1+...+ (g_{m,n}+h_{m,n})v_n)·vec(δ)_m $ to the entry-by-entry sum of the representation of $ g(vec(v)) $ and the representation of $ h(vec(v)) $. The representation of $(r· h)(vec(v))=r· [(h(vec(v))])$ $ r· [( (h_{1,1}v_1+h_{1,2}v_2+...+h_{1,n}v_n)vec(δ)_1 +... +(h_{m,1}v_1+h_{m,2}v_2+...+h_{m,n}v_n)vec(δ)_m]) =(rh_{1,1}v_1+...+rh_{1,n}v_n)·vec(δ)_1 +... +(rh_{m,1}v_1+...+rh_{m,n}v_n)·vec(δ)_m $ is the entry-by-entry multiple of $ r $ and the representation of $ h $.    Prove each, assuming that the operations are defined, where $ G $, $ H $, and $ J $ are matrices, where $ Z $ is the zero matrix, and where $ r $ and $ s $ are scalars.  Matrix addition is commutative $ G+H=H+G $. Matrix addition is associative $ G+(H+J)=(G+H)+J $. The zero matrix is an additive identity $ G+Z=G $. $ 0· G=Z $ $ (r+s)G=rG+sG $ Matrices have an additive inverse $ G+(-1)· G=Z $. $ r(G+H)=rG+rH $ $ (rs)G=r(sG) $   First, each of these properties is easy to check in an entry-by-entry way. For example, writing $ G= ([ g_{1,1} ... g_{1,n} ... ... g_{m,1} ... g_{m,n} ])  H= ([ h_{1,1} ... h_{1,n} ... ... h_{m,1} ... h_{m,n} ]) $ then, by definition we have $ G+H= ([ g_{1,1}+h_{1,1} ... g_{1,n}+h_{1,n} ... ... g_{m,1}+h_{m,1} ... g_{m,n}+h_{m,n} ]) $ and $ H+G= ([ h_{1,1}+g_{1,1} ... h_{1,n}+g_{1,n} ... ... h_{m,1}+g_{m,1} ... h_{m,n}+g_{m,n} ]) $ and the two are equal since their entries are equal $g_{i,j}+h_{i,j}=h_{i,j}+g_{i,j}$. That is, each of these is easy to check by using def:SumScalarProdMats alone.  However, each property is also easy to understand in terms of the represented maps, by applying as well as the definition.  The two maps $g+h$ and $h+g$ are equal because $g(vec(v))+h(vec(v))=h(vec(v))+g(vec(v))$, as addition is commutative in any vector space. Because the maps are the same, they must have the same representative. As with the prior answer, except that here we apply that vector space addition is associative. As before, except that here we note that $g(vec(v))+z(vec(v))=g(vec(v))+0=g(vec(v))$. Apply that $0· g(vec(v))=0=z(vec(v))$. Apply that $(r+s)· g(vec(v))=r· g(vec(v))+s· g(vec(v))$. Apply the prior two items with $r=1$ and $s=-1$. Apply that $r· (g(vec(v))+h(vec(v)))=r· g(vec(v))+r· h(vec(v))$. Apply that $(rs)· g(vec(v))=r·(s· g(vec(v)))$.    Fix domain and codomain spaces. In general, one matrix can represent many different maps with respect to different bases. However, prove that a zero matrix represents only a zero map. Are there other such matrices?  For any $ V,W $ with bases $ B,D $, the (appropriately-sized) zero matrix represents this map. $ vec(β)_1↦ 0·vec(δ)_1+...+0·vec(δ)_m ·s vec(β)_n↦ 0·vec(δ)_1+...+0·vec(δ)_m $ This is the zero map.  There are no other matrices that represent only one map. For, suppose that $ H $ is not the zero matrix. Then it has a nonzero entry; assume that $ h_{i,j} ≠ 0 $. With respect to bases $B,D$, it represents $ h_1: V → W $ sending $ vec(β)_j↦ h_{1,j}vec(δ)_1+...+h_{i,j}vec(δ)_i +...+h_{m,j}vec(δ)_m $ and with respect to $B,2· D$ it also represents $ h_2: V → W $ sending $ vec(β)_j↦ h_{1,j}·(2vec(δ)_1)+...+h_{i,j}·(2vec(δ)_i) +...+h_{m,j}·(2vec(δ)_m) $ (the notation $2· D$ means to double all of the members of D). These maps are easily seen to be unequal.   Let $ V $ and $ W $ be vector spaces of dimensions $ n $ and $ m $. Show that the space $ linmaps(V){W} $ of linear maps from $ V $ to $ W $ is isomorphic to $ matspace(_){N by M} $.  Fix bases $ B $ and $ D $ for $ V $ and $ W $, and consider $ map{Rep_{B,D}}{linmaps(V){W}}{matspace(_){N by M}} $ associating each linear map with the matrix representing that map $h↦ Representation of (h)$. From the prior section we know that (under fixed bases) the matrices correspond to linear maps, so the representation map is one-to-one and onto. That it preserves linear operations is .   Show that it follows from the prior questions that for any six transformations $ t_1,...,t_6: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ there are scalars $ c_1,...,c_6 in ℝ $ such that $ c_1t_1+...+c_6t_6 $ is the zero map. (Hint:~the six is slightly misleading.)  Fix bases and represent the transformations with $ N by N $ matrices. The space of matrices $ matspace(_){N by N} $ has dimension four, and hence the above six-element set is linearly dependent. By the prior exercise that extends to a dependence of maps. (The misleading part is only that there are six transformations, not five, so that we have more than we need to give the existence of the dependence.)   The trace of a square matrix is the sum of the entries on the main diagonal (the $ 1,1 $ entry plus the $ 2,2 $ entry, etc.; we will see the significance of the trace in Chapter Five). Show that $ trace(H+G)=trace(H)+trace(G) $. Is there a similar result for scalar multiplication?  That the trace of a sum is the sum of the traces holds because both $ trace(H+G) $ and $ trace(H)+trace(G) $ are the sum of $ h_{1,1}+g_{1,1} $ with $ h_{2,2}+g_{2,2} $, etc. For scalar multiplication we have $ trace(r· H)=r·trace(H) $; the proof is easy. Thus the trace map is a homomorphism from $matspace(_){N by N}$ to $ ℝ$.   Recall that the transpose  of a matrix $M$ is another matrix, whose $i,j$ entry is the $j,i$ entry of $M$. Verify these identities.  $ (G+H)ᵀ=Gᵀ+Hᵀ $ $ (r· H)ᵀ=r·Hᵀ $    The $ i,j $ entry of $ (G+H)ᵀ $ is $ g_{j,i}+h_{j,i} $. That is also the $ i,j $ entry of $ Gᵀ+Hᵀ $. The $ i,j $ entry of $ (r· H)ᵀ $ is $ rh_{j,i} $, which is also the $ i,j $ entry of $ r·Hᵀ $.    A square matrix is symmetric if each $ i,j $ entry equals the $ j,i $ entry, that is, if the matrix equals its transpose.  Prove that for any square~$H$, the matrix $ H+Hᵀ $ is symmetric. Does every symmetric matrix have this form? Prove that the set of $ N by N $ symmetric matrices is a subspace of $ matspace(_){N by N} $.    For $ H+Hᵀ $, the $ i,j $ entry is $ h_{i,j}+h_{j,i} $ and the $ j,i $ entry of is $ h_{j,i}+h_{i,j} $. The two are equal and thus $ H+Hᵀ $ is symmetric.  Every symmetric matrix does have that form, since we can write $ H=(1/2)·(H+Hᵀ) $. The set of symmetric matrices is nonempty as it contains the zero matrix. Clearly a scalar multiple of a symmetric matrix is symmetric. A sum $ H+G $ of two symmetric matrices is symmetric because $ h_{i,j}+g_{i,j}=h_{j,i}+g_{j,i} $ (since $ h_{i,j}=h_{j,i} $ and $ g_{i,j}=g_{j,i} $). Thus the subset is nonempty and closed under the inherited operations, and so it is a subspace.     How does matrix rank interact with scalar multiplication- can a scalar product of a rank~$ n $ matrix have rank less than $ n $? Greater? How does matrix rank interact with matrix addition- can a sum of rank~$ n $ matrices have rank less than $ n $? Greater?    Scalar multiplication leaves the rank of a matrix unchanged except that multiplication by zero leaves the matrix with rank zero. (This follows from the first theorem of the book, that multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar doesn't change the solution set of the associated linear system.) A sum of rank $ n $ matrices can have rank less than $ n $. For instance, for any matrix $ H $, the sum $ H+(-1)· H $ has rank zero.  A sum of rank $ n $ matrices can have rank greater than $ n $. Here are rank~one matrices that sum to a rank~two matrix. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]) +([ 0 0 0 1 ]) =([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $                After representing addition and scalar multiplication of linear maps in the prior subsection, the natural next operation to consider is function composition.    The composition of linear maps is linear.     textit{(Note: this argument has already appeared, as part of the proof of Theorem~I..)}  Let $h: V → W$ and $g: W → U$ be linear. The calculation $ ∘{g}{h}[(c_1·vec(v)_1+c_2·vec(v)_2]) =g[(h(c_1· vec(v)_1+c_2·vec(v)_2)]) =g[(c_1· h(vec(v)_1)+c_2· h(vec(v)_2)]) =c_1· g[(h(vec(v)_1))+c_2· g(h(vec(v)_2)]) =c_1· (∘{g}{h})(vec(v)_1) +c_2· (∘{g}{h})(vec(v)_2) $ shows that $map{∘{g}{h}}{V}{U}$ preserves linear combinations, and so is linear.    As we did with the operation of matrix addition and scalar multiplication, we will see how the representation of the composite relates to the representations of the compositors by first considering an example.  For example Let $h: ℝ^4 → ℝ^2$ and $g: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3$, fix bases $ B⊆ ℝ^4 $, $ C⊆ ℝ^2 $, $ D⊆ ℝ^3 $, and let these be the representations. $ H=Representation of (h) =([ 4 6 8 2 5 7 9 3 ])_{B,C}  G=Representation of (g) =([ 1 1 0 1 1 0 ])_{C,D} $ To represent the composition $ map{∘{g}{h}}{ ℝ^4}{ ℝ^3} $ we start with a $vec(v)$, represent $h$ of $vec(v)$, and then represent $g$ of that. The representation of $h(vec(v))$ is the product of $h$'s matrix and $vec(v)$'s vector. $ rep{h(vec(v))}{C} = ([ 4 6 8 2 5 7 9 3 ])_{B,C} [v_1 v_2 v_3 v_4]_B = [4v_1+6v_2+8v_3+2v_4 5v_1+7v_2+9v_3+3v_4]_C $ The representation of $g(h(vec(v)))$ is the product of $g$'s matrix and $h(vec(v))$'s vector. $ rep{g(h(vec(v)))}{D} =([ 1 1 0 1 1 0 ])_{C,D} [4v_1+6v_2+8v_3+2v_4 5v_1+7v_2+9v_3+3v_4]_C =colvec{1·(4v_1+6v_2+8v_3+2v_4)+1·(5v_1+7v_2+9v_3+3v_4) 0·(4v_1+6v_2+8v_3+2v_4)+1·(5v_1+7v_2+9v_3+3v_4) 1·(4v_1+6v_2+8v_3+2v_4)+0·(5v_1+7v_2+9v_3+3v_4)}_D $ Distributing and regrouping on the $v$'s gives $ = colvec{(1·4+1·5)v_1+ (1·6+1·7)v_2+ (1·8+1·9)v_3+ (1·2+1·3)v_4 (0·4+1·5)v_1+ (0·6+1·7)v_2+ (0·8+1·9)v_3+ (0·2+1·3)v_4 (1·4+0·5)v_1+ (1·6+0·7)v_2+ (1·8+0·9)v_3+ (1·2+0·3)v_4}_D $ which is this matrix-vector product. $ = ([ 1·4+1·5 1·6+1·7 1·8+1·9 1·2+1·3 0·4+1·5 0·6+1·7 0·8+1·9 0·2+1·3 1·4+0·5 1·6+0·7 1·8+0·9 1·2+0·3 ])_{B,D} [v_1 v_2 v_3 v_4]_D $ The matrix representing $∘{g}{h}$ has the rows of $G$ combined with the columns of $H$.     The matrix-multiplicative product  of the $ N by M $ matrix~$ G $ and the $ N by M $ matrix~$ H $ is the $ N by M $ matrix~$ P $, where $ p_{i,j} = g_{i,1}h_{1,j}+g_{i,2}h_{2,j}+...+g_{i,r}h_{r,j} $ so that the $ i,j $-th entry of the product is the dot product of the $ i $-th row of the first matrix with the $ j $-th column of the second. $ GH= ([ ... g_{i,1} g_{i,2} ·s g_{i,r} ... ]) ([ h_{1,j} ·s h_{2,j} ·s ... h_{r,j} ]) = ([ ... ·s p_{i,j} ·s ... ]) $    For example $ ([ 2 0 4 6 8 2 ]) ([ 1 3 5 7 ]) = ([ 2· 1+0· 5 2· 3+0· 7 4· 1+6· 5 4· 3+6· 7 8· 1+2· 5 8· 3+2· 7 ]) = ([ 2 6 34 54 18 38 ]) $    For example Some products are not defined, such as the product of a $N by M$ matrix with a $N by N$, because the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second. But the product of two $N by N$ matrices is always defined. Here are two $N by N$'s. $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) ([ -1 0 2 -2 ]) = ([ 1· (-1)+2· 2 1· 0+2· (-2) 3· (-1)+4· 2 3· 0+4· (-2) ]) = ([ 3 -4 5 -8 ]) $    For example The matrices from combine in this way. $ ([ 1 1 0 1 1 0 ]) ([ 4 6 8 2 5 7 9 3 ]) $ =([ 1·4+1·5 1·6+1·7 1·8+1·9 1·2+1·3 0·4+1·5 0·6+1·7 0·8+1·9 0·2+1·3 1·4+0·5 1·6+0·7 1·8+0·9 1·2+0·3 ]) =([ 9 13 17 5 5 7 9 3 4 6 8 2 ]) $ $          A composition of linear maps is represented by the matrix product of the representatives.     This argument generalizes .  Let $ h: V → W $ and $ g: W → X $ be represented by $ H $ and $ G $ with respect to bases $ B⊆ V $, $ C⊆ W $, and $ D⊆ X $, of sizes $ n $, $ r $, and $ m $. For any $ vec(v) in V $ the $ k $-th component of $ rep{h(vec(v))}{C} $ is $ h_{k,1}v_1+·s+h_{k,n}v_n $ and so the $ i $-th component of $ rep{∘{g}{h}(vec(v))}{D} $ is this. $ g_{i,1}·(h_{1,1}v_1+...+h_{1,n}v_n) +g_{i,2}·(h_{2,1}v_1+...+h_{2,n}v_n) +... +g_{i,r}·(h_{r,1}v_1+...+h_{r,n}v_n) $ Distribute and regroup on the $ v $'s. $ =(g_{i,1} h_{1,1}+g_{i,2} h_{2,1}+...+g_{i,r}h_{r,1})· v_1 +... +(g_{i,1} h_{1,n}+g_{i,2} h_{2,n} +...+g_{i,r} h_{r,n})· v_n $   Finish by recognizing that the coefficient of each $ v_j $ $ g_{i,1}h_{1,j}+g_{i,2}h_{2,j}+...+g_{i,r}h_{r,j} $ matches the definition of the $ i,j $ entry of the product $ GH $.     This arrow diagram pictures the relationship between maps and matrices (`wrt' abbreviates `with respect to').          Above the arrows, the maps show that the two ways of going from $ V $ to $ X $, straight over via the composition or else in two steps by way of $ W $, have the same effect $ vec(v)gcirc(h) ↓g(h(vec(v)))  vec(v)h ↓h(vec(v))g ↓g(h(vec(v))) $ (this is just the definition of composition). Below the arrows, the matrices indicate that multiplying $GH$ into the column vector $rep{vec(v)}{B}$ has the same effect as multiplying the column vector first by $H$ and then multiplying the result by $G$. $ rep{∘{g}{h}}{B,D} =GH  Representation of (g)Representation of (h)=GH $   As mentioned in , because the number of columns on the left does not equal the number of rows on the right, the product as here of a $N by M$ matrix with a $N by N$ matrix is not defined. $ ([ -1 2 0 0 10 1.1 ]) ([ 0 0 0 2 ]) $ The definition requires that the sizes match because we want that the underlying function composition is possible. $ dimension $ n $ space stackrel(h){-->} dimension $ r $ space stackrel(g){-->} dimension $ m $ space  $ Thus, matrix product combines an $N by M$ matrix~$G$ with an $N by M$ matrix~$F$ to yield the $N by M$ result~$GF$. Briefly: $N by M times N by M equals N by M$.   The order in which we write things can be confusing. In `$N by M times N by M equals N by M$' the number written first $m$ is the dimension of $g$'s codomain and is thus the number that appears last in the map dimension description~($*$). The explanation is that while $h$ is done first and is followed by $g$, we write the composition as $∘{g}{h}$, with $g$ on the left, from the notation $g(h(vec(v)))$.   That carries over to matrices, so that $∘{g}{h}$ is represented by $GH$.   We can get insight into matrix-matrix product operation by studying how the entries combine. For instance, an alternative way to understand why we require above that the sizes match is that the row of the left-hand matrix must have the same number of entries as the column of the right-hand matrix, or else some entry will be left without a matching entry from the other matrix.  Another aspect of the combinatorics of matrix multiplication, in the sum defining the $i,j$ entry, is brought out here by the boxing the equal subscripts. $ p_{i,j} = g_{i,$1 $}h_{$1 $,j} +g_{i,$2 $}h_{$2 $,j} +...+g_{i,$r $}h_{$r $,j} $ The highlighted subscripts on the $g$'s are column indices while those on the $h$'s are for rows. That is, the summation takes place over the columns of $G$ but over the rows of $H$- the definition treats left differently than right. So we may reasonably suspect that $ GH $ can be unequal to $ HG $.  For example Matrix multiplication is not commutative. $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) ([ 5 6 7 8 ]) = ([ 19 22 43 50 ])  ([ 5 6 7 8 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) = ([ 23 34 31 46 ]) $     For example Commutativity can fail more dramatically: $ ([ 5 6 7 8 ]) ([ 1 2 0 3 4 0 ]) = ([ 23 34 0 31 46 0 ]) $ while $ ([ 1 2 0 3 4 0 ]) ([ 5 6 7 8 ]) $ isn't even defined.    The fact that matrix multiplication is not commutative can seem odd at first, perhaps because most mathematical operations in prior courses are commutative. But matrix multiplication represents function composition and function composition is not commutative: if $ f(x)=2x $ and $ g(x)=x+1 $ then $ ∘{g}{f}(x)=2x+1 $ while $ ∘{f}{g}(x)=2(x+1)=2x+2 $.      Except for the lack of commutativity, matrix multiplication is algebraically well-behaved. The next result gives some nice properties and more are in and .    If $ F $, $ G $, and $ H $ are matrices, and the matrix products are defined, then the product is associative $(FG)H=F(GH)$ and distributes over matrix addition $F(G+H)=FG+FH$ and $(G+H)F=GF+HF$.      Associativity holds because matrix multiplication represents function composition, which is associative:~the maps $ ∘{(∘{f}{g})}{h} $ and $ ∘{f}{(∘{g}{h})} $ are equal as both send $ vec(v) $ to $ f(g(h(vec(v)))) $.    Distributivity is similar. For instance, the first one goes $ ∘{f}{(g+h)}(vec(v)) =f[((g+h)(vec(v))]) =f[(g(vec(v))+h(vec(v))]) =f(g(vec(v)))+f(h(vec(v))) =∘{f}{g}(vec(v))+∘{f}{h}(vec(v)) $ (the third equality uses the linearity of $f$). Right-distributivity goes the same way.     We could instead prove that result by slogging through indices. For example, for associativity the $ i,j $ entry of $ (FG)H $ is $ MoveEqLeft(f_{i,1}g_{1,1}+f_{i,2}g_{2,1}+...+f_{i,r}g_{r,1})h_{1,j} +(f_{i,1}g_{1,2}+f_{i,2}g_{2,2}+...+f_{i,r}g_{r,2})h_{2,j} ... +(f_{i,1}g_{1,s}+f_{i,2}g_{2,s}+...+f_{i,r}g_{r,s})h_{s,j} $ where $ F $, $ G $, and $ H $ are $ N by M $, $ N by M $, and $ N by M $ matrices. Distribute $ MoveEqLeft(f_){i,1}g_{1,1}h_{1,j}+f_{i,2}g_{2,1}h_{1,j}+ ...+f_{i,r}g_{r,1}h_{1,j} +f_{i,1}g_{1,2}h_{2,j}+f_{i,2}g_{2,2}h_{2,j}+ ...+f_{i,r}g_{r,2}h_{2,j} ... +f_{i,1}g_{1,s}h_{s,j}+f_{i,2}g_{2,s}h_{s,j}+... +f_{i,r}g_{r,s}h_{s,j} $ and regroup around the $ f $'s $ MoveEqLeft(f_){i,1}(g_{1,1}h_{1,j}+g_{1,2}h_{2,j}+...+g_{1,s}h_{s,j}) +f_{i,2}(g_{2,1}h_{1,j}+g_{2,2}h_{2,j}+...+g_{2,s}h_{s,j}) ... +f_{i,r}(g_{r,1}h_{1,j}+g_{r,2}h_{2,j}+...+g_{r,s}h_{s,j}) $ to get the $ i,j $ entry of $ F(GH) $.  Contrast the two proofs. The index-heavy argument is hard to understand in that while the calculations are easy to check, the arithmetic seems unconnected to any idea. The argument in the proof is shorter and also says why this property ``really'' holds. This illustrates the comments made at the start of the chapter on vector spaces- at least sometimes an argument from higher-level constructs is clearer.   We have now seen how to represent the composition of linear maps. The next subsection will continue to explore this operation.    Compute, or state ``not defined''.   $([ 3 1 -4 2 ]) ([ 0 5 0 0.5 ])$ $ ([ 1 1 -1 4 0 3 ]) ([ 2 -1 -1 3 1 1 3 1 1 ]) $ $ ([ 2 -7 7 4 ]) ([ 1 0 5 -1 1 1 3 8 4 ]) $ $ ([ 5 2 3 1 ]) ([ -1 2 3 -5 ]) $     $([ 0 15.5 0 -19 ])$ $ ([ 2 -1 -1 17 -1 -1 ]) $ Not defined. $ ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $    Where $ A= ([ 1 -1 2 0 ])  B= ([ 5 2 4 4 ])  C= ([ -2 3 -4 1 ]) $ compute or state `not defined'.  $ AB $ $ (AB)C $ $ BC $ $ A(BC) $    $ ([ 1 -2 10 4 ]) $ $ ([ 1 -2 10 4 ]) ([ -2 3 -4 1 ])= ([ 6 1 -36 34 ]) $ $ ([ -18 17 -24 16 ]) $ $ ([ 1 -1 2 0 ]) ([ -18 17 -24 16 ])= ([ 6 1 -36 34 ]) $    Which products are defined?  $ N by M $~times~$ N by M $ $ N by M $~times~$ N by M $ $ N by M $~times~$ N by M $ $ N by M $~times~$ N by M $    Yes. Yes. No. No.    Give the size of the product or state ``not defined''.  a $ N by M $ matrix times a $ N by M $ matrix a $ N by M $ matrix times a $ N by M $ matrix a $ N by M $ matrix times a $ N by M $ matrix a $ N by M $ matrix times a $ N by M $ matrix    $ N by M $ $ N by M $ Not defined. $ N by M $    Find the system of equations resulting from starting with $ $ h_{1,1}x_1 + h_{1,2}x_2 + h_{1,3}x_3 = d_1 h_{2,1}x_1 + h_{2,2}x_2 + h_{2,3}x_3 = d_2 $ $ and making this change of variable (i.e., substitution). $ $ x_1 = g_{1,1}y_1 + g_{1,2}y_2 x_2 = g_{2,1}y_1 + g_{2,2}y_2 x_3 = g_{3,1}y_1 + g_{3,2}y_2 $ $  We have $ $ h_{1,1}·(g_{1,1}y_1+g_{1,2}y_2) + h_{1,2}· (g_{2,1}y_1+g_{2,2}y_2) + h_{1,3}· (g_{3,1}y_1+g_{3,2}y_2) = d_1 h_{2,1}·(g_{1,1}y_1+g_{1,2}y_2) + h_{2,2}· (g_{2,1}y_1+g_{2,2}y_2) + h_{2,3}· (g_{3,1}y_1+g_{3,2}y_2) = d_2 $ $ which, after expanding and regrouping about the $y$'s yields this. $ $ (h_{1,1}g_{1,1}+h_{1,2}g_{2,1}+h_{1,3}g_{3,1})y_1 + (h_{1,1}g_{1,2}+h_{1,2}g_{2,2}+h_{1,3}g_{3,2})y_2 = d_1 (h_{2,1}g_{1,1}+h_{2,2}g_{2,1}+h_{2,3}g_{3,1})y_1 + (h_{2,1}g_{1,2}+h_{2,2}g_{2,2}+h_{2,3}g_{3,2})y_2 = d_2 $ $ We can express the starting system and the system used for the substitutions in matrix language, as $ ([ h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{1,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} ]) [x_1 x_2 x_3] =H[x_1 x_2 x_3]=[d_1 d_2] $ and $ ([ g_{1,1} g_{1,2} g_{2,1} g_{2,2} g_{3,1} g_{3,2} ]) [y_1 y_2] =G[y_1 y_2]=[x_1 x_2 x_3] $ and with this, the substitution is $vec(d)=Hvec(x)=H(Gvec(y))=(HG)vec(y)$.  Consider the two linear functions $h: ℝ^3 → polyspace(_2)$ and $map(g){polyspace(_2)}{matspace(_){N by N}}$ given as here. $ [a b c]↦ (a+b)x^2+(2a+2b)x+c  px^2+qx+r↦ ([ p p-2q q 0 ]) $ Use these bases for the spaces. begin(gather*) B=sequence{[1 1 1], [0 1 1], [0 0 1]}  C=1+x,1-x,x^2  D=sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 2 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 3 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 4 ])} end(gather*)  Give the formula for the composition map $map{∘{g}{h}}{ ℝ^3}{matspace(_){N by N}}$ derived directly from the above definition. Represent $h$ and~$g$ with respect to the appropriate bases. Represent the map $∘{g}{h}$ computed in the first part with respect to the appropriate bases. Check that the product of the two matrices from the second part is the matrix from the third part.     Following the definitions gives this. $ [a b c] ↦ (a+b)x^2+(2a+2b)x+c ↦ ([ a+b (a+b)-2(2a+2b) 2a+2b 0 ]) = ([ a+b -3a-3b 2a+2b 0 ]) $  Because $ [1 1 1]↦ 2x^2+4x+1  [0 1 1]↦ x^2+2x+1  [0 0 1]↦ 0x^2+0x+1 $ we get this representation for~$h$. $ Representation of (h) = ([ 5/2 3/2 1/2 -3/2 -1/2 1/2 2 1 0 ]) $ Similarly, because $ 1+x↦ ([ 0 -2 1 0 ])  1-x↦ ([ 0 2 -1 0 ])  x^2↦ ([ 1 1 0 0 ]) $ this is the representation of~$g$. $ Representation of (g)= ([ 0 0 1 -1 1 1/2 1/3 -1/3 0 0 0 0 ]) $  The action of $∘{g}{h}$ on the domain basis is this. $ [1 1 1]↦ ([ 2 -6 4 0 ])  [0 1 1]↦ ([ 1 -3 2 0 ])  [0 0 1]↦ ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) $ We have this. $ rep{∘{g}{h}}{B,D}= ([ 2 1 0 -3 -3/2 0 4/3 2/3 0 0 0 0 ]) $  The matrix multiplication is routine, just take care with the order. $ ([ 0 0 1 -1 1 1/2 1/3 -1/3 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 5/2 3/2 1/2 -3/2 -1/2 1/2 2 1 0 ]) = ([ 2 1 0 -3 -3/2 0 4/3 2/3 0 0 0 0 ]) $    As def:MatMult points out, the matrix product operation generalizes the dot product. Is the dot product of a $ N by M $ row vector and a $ N by M $ column vector the same as their matrix-multiplicative product?  Technically, no. The dot product operation yields a scalar while the matrix product yields a $N by N$ matrix. However, we usually will ignore the distinction.   Represent the derivative map on $ polyspace(_n) $ with respect to $ B,B $ where $ B $ is the natural basis $ 1,x,...,x^n $. Show that the product of this matrix with itself is defined; what map does it represent?  The action of $d/dx$ on $B$ is $1↦0$, $x↦ 1$, $x^2↦ 2x$, ... and so this is its $N by (n+1)$ matrix representation. $ (d/dx){B,B}= ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 ... 0 0 0 n 0 0 0 0 ]) $ The product of this matrix with itself is defined because the matrix is square. $ ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 ... 0 0 0 n 0 0 0 0 ])^2 = ([ 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 ... 0 0 0 n(n-1) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ The map so represented is the composition $ p(d/dx) ↓(dp/dx) (d/dx) ↓(d^2p/dx^2) $ which is the second derivative operation.    Match each type of matrix with all these descriptions that could fit: (i)~can be multiplied by its transpose to make a $N by N$ matrix, (ii)~is similar to the $N by N$ matrix of all zeros, (iii)~can represent a linear map from $ ℝ^3$ to $ ℝ^2$ that is not onto, (iv)~can represent an isomorphism from $ ℝ^3$ to $polyspace$.  a $N by M$ matrix whose rank is~$1$ a $N by N$ matrix that is nonsingular a $N by N$ matrix that is singular an $N by M$ column vector    iii iv None None (or (i) if we allow multiplication from the left)    Show that composition of linear transformations on $ ℝ^1 $ is commutative. Is this true for any one-dimensional space?  It is true for all one-dimensional spaces. Let $f$ and $g$ be transformations of a one-dimensional space. We must show that $∘{g}{f}(vec(v))=∘{f}{g}(vec(v))$ for all vectors. Fix a basis $B$ for the space and then the transformations are represented by $N by N$ matrices. $ F=Representation of (f)=([ f_{1,1} ])  G=Representation of (g)=([ g_{1,1} ]) $ Therefore, the compositions can be represented as $GF$ and $FG$. $ GF=rep{∘{g}{f}}{B,B}=([ g_{1,1}f_{1,1} ])  FG=rep{∘{f}{g}}{B,B}=([ f_{1,1}g_{1,1} ]) $ These two matrices are equal and so the compositions have the same effect on each vector in the space.   Why is matrix multiplication not defined as entry-wise multiplication? That would be easier, and commutative too.  It would not represent linear map composition; would fail.    Prove that $H^pH^q=H^{p+q}$ and $(H^p)^q=H^{pq}$ for positive integers $ p,q $. Prove that $(rH)^p=r^p· H^p$ for any positive integer $ p $ and scalar $ r in ℝ $.   Each follows easily from the associated map fact. For instance, $p$ applications of the transformation $h$, following $q$ applications, is simply $p+q$ applications.    How does matrix multiplication interact with scalar multiplication:~is $ r(GH)=(rG)H $? Is $ G(rH)=r(GH) $? How does matrix multiplication interact with linear combinations:~is $ F(rG+sH)=r(FG)+s(FH) $? Is $(rF+sG)H=rFH+sGH$?   Although we can do these by going through the indices, they are best understood in terms of the represented maps. That is, fix spaces and bases so that the matrices represent linear maps $f,g,h$.  Yes; we have both $r· (∘{g}{h})(vec(v)) =r· g(h(vec(v))) =∘{(r· g)}{h}(vec(v))$ and $∘{g}{(r· h)}(vec(v))=g(r· h(vec(v))) =r· g(h(vec(v))) =r· (∘{g}{h})(vec(v))$ (the second equality holds because of the linearity of $g$). Both answers are yes. First, $∘{f}{(rg+sh)}$ and $r·(∘{f}{g})+s·(∘{f}{h})$ both send $vec(v)$ to $r· f(g(vec(v)))+s· f(h(vec(v)))$; the calculation is as in the prior item (using the linearity of $f$ for the first one). For the other, $∘{(rf+sg)}{h}$ and $r·(∘{f}{h})+s·(∘{g}{h})$ both send $vec(v)$ to $r· f(h(vec(v)))+s· g(h(vec(v)))$.    We can ask how the matrix product operation interacts with the transpose operation.  Show that $ (GH)ᵀ=HᵀGᵀ $. A square matrix is symmetric if each $ i,j $ entry equals the $ j,i $ entry, that is, if the matrix equals its own transpose. Show that the matrices $ HHᵀ $ and $ HᵀH $ are symmetric.    We have not seen a map interpretation of the transpose operation, so we will verify these by considering the entries.  The $ i,j $ entry of $ GHᵀ $ is the $j,i$ entry of $GH$, which is the dot product of the $ j $-th row of $ G $ and the $ i $-th column of $ H $. The $ i,j $ entry of $ HᵀGᵀ $ is the dot product of the $ i $-th row of $ Hᵀ $ and the $ j $-th column of $ Gᵀ $, which is the dot product of the $ i $-th column of $ H $ and the $ j $-th row of $ G $. Dot product is commutative and so these two are equal. By the prior item each equals its transpose, e.g., $trans((HHᵀ))=trans(Hᵀ)Hᵀ=HHᵀ$.    Rotation of vectors in $ ℝ^3 $ about an axis is a linear map. Show that linear maps do not commute by showing geometrically that rotations do not commute.  Consider $ r_x,r_y: ℝ^3 → ℝ^3 $ rotating all vectors $ π/2 $~radians counterclockwise about the $ x $ and $ y $~axes (counterclockwise in the sense that a person whose head is at $ vec(e)_1 $ or $ vec(e)_2 $ and whose feet are at the origin sees, when looking toward the origin, the rotation as counterclockwise).      Rotating $r_x$ first and then $r_y$ is different than rotating $r_y$ first and then $r_x$. In particular, $r_x(vec(e)_3)=-vec(e)_2$ so $∘{r_y}{r_x}(vec(e)_3)=-vec(e)_2$, while $r_y(vec(e)_3)=vec(e)_1$ so $∘{r_x}{r_y}(vec(e)_3)=vec(e)_1$, and hence the maps do not commute.   In the proof of we used some maps. What are the domains and codomains?  It doesn't matter (as long as the spaces have the appropriate dimensions).  For associativity, suppose that $F$ is $N by M$, that $G$ is $N by M$, and that $H$ is $N by M$. We can take any $r$~dimensional space, any $m$~dimensional space, any $n$~dimensional space, and any $k$~dimensional space- for instance, $ ℝ^r$, $ ℝ^m$, $ ℝ^n$, and $ ℝ^k$ will do. We can take any bases $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, for those spaces. Then, with respect to $C,D$ the matrix $H$ represents a linear map $h$, with respect to $B,C$ the matrix $G$ represents a $g$, and with respect to $A,B$ the matrix $F$ represents an $f$. We can use those maps in the proof.  The second half is similar, except that we add $G$ and $H$ and so we must take them to represent maps with the same domain and codomain.   How does matrix rank interact with matrix multiplication?  Can the product of rank $ n $ matrices have rank less than $ n $? Greater? Show that the rank of the product of two matrices is less than or equal to the minimum of the rank of each factor.    The product of rank $ n $ matrices can have rank less than or equal to $ n $ but not greater than $ n $.  To see that the rank can fall, consider the maps $ π_x,π_y: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ projecting onto the axes. Each is rank one but their composition $∘{π_x}{π_y}$, which is the zero map, is rank zero. That translates over to matrices representing those maps in this way. $ Representation of (π_x)·Representation of (π_y)= ([ 1 0 0 0 ]) ([ 0 0 0 1 ])= ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) $  To prove that the product of rank $ n $ matrices cannot have rank greater than $ n $, we can apply the map result that the image of a linearly dependent set is linearly dependent. That is, if $ h: V → W $ and $ g: W → X $ both have rank $ n $ then a set in the range $ rangespace{∘{g}{h}} $ of size larger than $ n $ is the image under $ g $ of a set in $ W $ of size larger than $ n $ and so is linearly dependent (since the rank of $ h $ is $ n $). Now, the image of a linearly dependent set is dependent, so any set of size larger than $ n $ in the range is dependent. (By the way, observe that the rank of $ g $ was not mentioned. See the next part.) Fix spaces and bases and consider the associated linear maps $ f $ and $ g $. Recall that the dimension of the image of a map (the map's rank) is less than or equal to the dimension of the domain, and consider the arrow diagram. $ begin(matrix) V f ↓ f g ↓ rangespace{∘{g}{f}} end(matrix) $ First, the image of $ f $ must have dimension less than or equal to the dimension of $ f $, by the prior sentence. On the other hand, $ f $ is a subset of the domain of $ g $, and thus its image has dimension less than or equal the dimension of the domain of $ g $. Combining those two, the rank of a composition is less than or equal to the minimum of the two ranks.  The matrix fact follows immediately.    Is `commutes with' an equivalence relation among $N by N$ matrices?  The `commutes with' relation is reflexive and symmetric. However, it is not transitive:~for instance, with $ G=([ 1 2 3 4 ])  H=([ 1 0 0 1 ])  J=([ 5 6 7 8 ]) $ $G$ commutes with $H$ and $H$ commutes with $J$, but $G$ does not commute with $J$.   (We will use this exercise in the Matrix Inverses exercises.) Here is another property of matrix multiplication that might be puzzling at first sight.  Prove that the composition of the projections $ π_x,π_y: ℝ^3 → ℝ^3 $ onto the $ x $ and $ y $~axes is the zero map despite that neither one is itself the zero map. Prove that the composition of the derivatives $ d^2/dx^2,d^3/dx^3: polyspace(_4) → polyspace(_4) $ is the zero map despite that neither is the zero map. Give a matrix equation representing the first fact. Give a matrix equation representing the second.  When two things multiply to give zero despite that neither is zero we say that each is a zero divisor.    Either of these. $ [x y z] π_x ↓ [x 0 0] π_y ↓ [0 0 0]  [x y z] π_y ↓ [0 y 0] π_x ↓ [0 0 0] $ The composition is the fifth derivative map $d^5/dx^5$ on the space of fourth-degree polynomials. With respect to the natural bases, $ Representation of (π_x)=([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])  Representation of (π_y)=([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]) $ and their product (in either order) is the zero matrix. Where $ B=1,x,x^2,x^3,x^4 $, $ (d^2/dx^2){B,B}=([ 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])  (d^3/dx^3){B,B}=([ 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 24 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ and their product (in either order) is the zero matrix.    Show that, for square matrices, $ (S+T)(S-T) $ need not equal $ S^2-T^2 $.  Note that $ (S+T)(S-T)=S^2-ST+TS-T^2 $, so a reasonable try is to look at matrices that do not commute so that $-ST$ and $TS$ don't cancel:~with $ S=([ 1 2 3 4 ])  T=([ 5 6 7 8 ]) $ we have the desired inequality. $ (S+T)(S-T)=([ -56 -56 -88 -88 ])  S^2-T^2=([ -60 -68 -76 -84 ]) $   Represent the identity transformation $I: V → V$ with respect to $B,B$ for any basis $B$. This is the identity matrix $I$. Show that this matrix plays the role in matrix multiplication that the number $1$ plays in real number multiplication:~$HI=IH=H$ (for all matrices $H$ for which the product is defined).  Because the identity map acts on the basis $B$ as $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_1$, ..., $vec(β)_n↦vec(β)_n$, the representation is this. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ... 0 0 0 1 ]) $ The second part of the question is obvious from .   In real number algebra, quadratic equations have at most two solutions. That is not so with matrix algebra. Show that the $ N by N $ matrix equation $ T^2=I $ has more than two solutions, where $I$ is the identity matrix (this matrix has ones in its $1,1$ and $2,2$ entries and zeroes elsewhere;~see ).  Here are four solutions. $ T=([ ± 1 0 0 ± 1 ]) $    Prove that for any $ N by N $ matrix $ T $ there are scalars $ c_0,...,c_4 $ that are not all $0$ such that the combination $c_4T^4+c_3T^3+c_2T^2+c_1T+c_0I$ is the zero matrix (where $I$ is the $N by N$ identity matrix, with $1$'s in its $1,1$ and $2,2$ entries and zeroes elsewhere;~see ). Let $ p(x) $ be a polynomial $ p(x)=c_nx^n+...+c_1x+c_0 $. If $ T $ is a square matrix we define $ p(T) $ to be the matrix $ c_nT^n+...+c_1T+c_0I $ (where $I$ is the appropriately-sized identity matrix). Prove that for any square matrix there is a polynomial such that $ p(T) $ is the zero matrix. The minimal polynomial  $m(x)$ of a square matrix is the polynomial of least degree, and with leading coefficient $ 1 $, such that $ m(T) $ is the zero matrix. Find the minimal polynomial of this matrix. $ ([ √{3}/2 -1/2 1/2 √{3}/2 ]) $ (This is the representation with respect to $stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)$, the standard basis, of a rotation through $π/6$~radians counterclockwise.)    The vector space $ matspace(_){N by N} $ has dimension four. The set $ {T^4,...,T,I} $ has five elements and thus is linearly dependent. Where $ T $ is $ N by N $, generalizing the argument from the prior item shows that there is such a polynomial of degree $ n^2 $ or less, since $ {T^{{n^2},...,T,I} $ is a $ n^2+1 $-member subset of the $n^2$-dimensional space $matspace(_){N by N}$. First compute the powers $ T^2= ([ 1/2 -√{3}/2 √{3}/2 1/2 ])  T^3= ([ 0 -1 1 0 ])  T^4= ([ -1/2 -√{3}/2 √{3}/2 -1/2 ]) $ (observe that rotating by $π/6$ three times results in a rotation by $π/2$, which is indeed what $T^3$ represents). Then set $ c_4T^4+c_3T^3+c_2T^2+c_1T+c_0I $ equal to the zero matrix $ ([ -1/2 -√{3}/2 √{3}/2 -1/2 ])c_4 +([ 0 -1 1 0 ])c_3 +([ 1/2 -√{3}/2 √{3}/2 1/2 ])c_2 +([ √{3}/2 -1/2 1/2 √{3}/2 ])c_1 +([ 1 0 0 1 ])c_0 =([ 0 0 0 0 ]) $ to get this linear system. $ $ -(1/2)c_4 + (1/2)c_2 + (√{3}/2)c_1 + c_0 = 0 -(√{3}/2)c_4 - c_3 - (√{3}/2)c_2 - (1/2)c_1 = 0 (√{3}/2)c_4 + c_3 + (√{3}/2)c_2 + (1/2)c_1 = 0 -(1/2)c_4 + (1/2)c_2 + (√{3}/2)c_1 + c_0 = 0 $ $ Apply Gaussian reduction. $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_4$ repeat step $ρ_2+ρ_3$ $ -(1/2)c_4 + (1/2)c_2 + (√{3}/2)c_1 + c_0 = 0 -(√{3}/2)c_4 - c_3 - (√{3}/2)c_2 - (1/2)c_1 = 0  0 = 0  0 = 0 $ grstep{-√{3}ρ_1+ρ_2} $ -(1/2)c_4 + (1/2)c_2 + (√{3}/2)c_1 + c_0 = 0 - c_3 - √{3}c_2 - 2c_1 - √{3}c_0 = 0  0 = 0  0 = 0 $ $ Setting $ c_4 $, $ c_3 $, and $ c_2 $ to zero makes $ c_1 $ and $ c_0 $ also come out to be zero so no degree one or degree zero polynomial will do. Setting $ c_4 $ and $ c_3 $ to zero (and $c_2$ to one) gives a linear system $ $ (1/2) + (√{3}/2)c_1 + c_0 = 0 -√{3} - 2c_1 - √{3}c_0 = 0 $ $ with solution $c_1=-√{3}$ and $c_0=1$. Conclusion:~the polynomial $m(x)=x^2-√{3}x+1$ is minimal for the matrix $T$.    The infinite-dimensional space $polyspace$ of all finite-degree polynomials gives a memorable example of the non-commutativity of linear maps. Let $ d/dx: polyspace→ polyspace$ be the usual derivative and let $ s: polyspace→ polyspace$ be the shift map. $ a_0+a_1x+...+a_nx^n s ↓ 0+a_0x+a_1x^2+...+a_nx^{n+1} $ Show that the two maps don't commute $ ∘{d/dx}{s} ≠ ∘{s}{d/dx} $; in fact, not only is $ (∘{d/dx}{s})-(∘{s}{d/dx}) $ not the zero map, it is the identity map.  The check is routine: $ a_0+a_1x+...+a_nx^ns ↓a_0x+a_1x^2+...+a_nx^{n+1} d/dx ↓ a_0+2a_1x+...+(n+1)a_nx^n $ while $ a_0+a_1x+...+a_nx^n d/dx ↓ a_1+...+na_nx^{n-1} s ↓a_1x+...+a_nx^n $ so that under the map $(∘{d/dx}{s})-(∘{s}{d/dx})$ we have $a_0+a_1x+...+a_nx^n ↦ a_0+a_1x+...+a_nx^n$.   Recall the notation for the sum of the sequence of numbers $ a_1, a_2, ..., a_n $. $ ∑_{i=1}^{n}a_i=a_1+a_2+...+a_n $ In this notation, the $ i,j $ entry of the product of $ G $ and $ H $ is this. $ p_{i,j}=∑_{k=1}^ g_{i,k}h_{k,j} $ Using this notation,  reprove that matrix multiplication is associative; reprove .    Tracing through the remark at the end of the subsection gives that the $ i,j $ entry of $ (FG)H $ is this $ ∑_{t=1}^s[(∑_{k=1}^ f_{i,k}g_{k,t}])h_{t,j} =∑_{t=1}^s∑_{k=1}^ (f_{i,k}g_{k,t})h_{t,j} =∑_{t=1}^s∑_{k=1}^ f_{i,k}(g_{k,t}h_{t,j}) =∑_{k=1}^∑_{t=1}^s f_{i,k}(g_{k,t}h_{t,j}) =∑_{k=1}^f_{i,k}[(∑_{t=1}^s g_{k,t}h_{t,j}]) $ (the first equality comes from using the distributive law to multiply through the $h$'s, the second equality is the associative law for real numbers, the third is the commutative law for reals, and the fourth equality follows on using the distributive law to factor the $f$'s out), which is the $ i,j $ entry of $ F(GH) $. The $ k $-th component of $ h(vec(v))$ is $ ∑_{j=1}^n h_{k,j}v_j $ and so the $ i $-th component of $ ∘{g}{h}(vec(v)) $ is this $ ∑_{k=1}^r g_{i,k}[(∑_{j=1}^n h_{k,j}v_j]) =∑_{k=1}^r ∑_{j=1}^n g_{i,k}h_{k,j}v_j =∑_{k=1}^r ∑_{j=1}^n (g_{i,k}h_{k,j})v_j  =∑_{j=1}^n ∑_{k=1}^r (g_{i,k}h_{k,j})v_j =∑_{j=1}^n (∑_{k=1}^r g_{i,k}h_{k,j})v_j $ (the first equality holds by using the distributive law to multiply the $g$'s through, the second equality represents the use of associativity of reals, the third follows by commutativity of reals, and the fourth comes from using the distributive law to factor the $v$'s out).                          We can consider matrix multiplication as a mechanical process, putting aside for the moment any implications about the underlying maps.  The striking thing about this operation is the way that rows and columns combine. The $ i,j $ entry of the matrix product is the dot product of row~$i$ of the left matrix with column~$j$ of the right one. For instance, here a second row and a third column combine to make a $2,3$~entry. $ setlength(\fboxsep){1.5pt} ([ $ 1 1 $ highlight{${@ 0 1 $}} $ 1 0 $ ]) ([ $ 4 5 $ $ 6 7 $ highlight{ $${@ 8 9 $$ }} $ 2 3 $ ]) = ([ 9 13 17 5 5 7 $9$ 3 4 6 8 2 ]) $ We can view this as the left matrix acting by multiplying its rows into the columns of the right matrix. Or, it is the right matrix using its columns to act on the rows of the left matrix. Below, we will examine actions from the left and from the right for some simple matrices.  Simplest is the zero matrix.  For example Multiplying by a zero matrix from the left or from the right results in a zero matrix. $ ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 1 3 2 -1 1 -1 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])  ([ 2 3 1 4 ]) ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) $   The next easiest matrices are the ones with a single nonzero entry.    A matrix with all $0$'s except for a $1$ in the $ i,j $ entry is an $ i,j $ unit matrix (or matrix unit).    For example This is the $ 1,2 $ unit matrix with three rows and two columns, multiplying from the left. $ ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 5 6 7 8 ]) = ([ 7 8 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Acting from the left, an $ i,j $ unit matrix copies row~$ j $ of the multiplicand into row~$ i $ of the result. From the right an $ i,j $ unit matrix picks out column~$ i $ of the multiplicand and copies it into column~$ j $ of the result. $ ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]) ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]) = ([ 0 1 0 4 0 7 ]) $   For example Rescaling unit matrices simply rescales the result. This is the action from the left of the matrix that is twice the one in the prior example. $ ([ 0 2 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 5 6 7 8 ]) = ([ 14 16 0 0 0 0 ]) $                       Next in complication are matrices with two nonzero entries.  For example There are two cases. If a left-multiplier has entries in different rows then their actions don't interact. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]) =( ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) + ([ 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 ]) ) ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]) =([ 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) + ([ 0 0 0 14 16 18 0 0 0 ]) =([ 1 2 3 14 16 18 0 0 0 ]) $ But if the left-multiplier's nonzero entries are in the same row then that row of the result is a combination. $ ([ 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]) =( ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) + ([ 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) ) ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]) =([ 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) + ([ 14 16 18 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) =([ 15 18 21 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $   parRight(-multiplication) acts in the same way, but with columns.  For example Consider the columns of the product of two $N by N$~matrices. $ ([ g_{1,1} g_{1,2} g_{2,1} g_{2,2} ]) ([ h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} ]) = ([ g_{1,1}h_{1,1}+g_{1,2}h_{2,1} g_{1,1}h_{1,2}+g_{1,2}h_{2,2} g_{2,1}h_{1,1}+g_{2,2}h_{2,1} g_{2,1}h_{1,2}+g_{2,2}h_{2,2} ]) $ Each column is the result of multiplying $G$ by the corresponding column of $H$. $ G[h_{1,1] h_{2,1}} = [g_{1,1]h_{1,1}+g_{1,2}h_{2,1} g_{2,1}h_{1,1}+g_{2,2}h_{2,1}}  G[h_{1,2] h_{2,2}} =[g_{1,1]h_{1,2}+g_{1,2}h_{2,2} g_{2,1}h_{1,2}+g_{2,2}h_{2,2}} $      In a product of two matrices $G$ and $H$, the columns of $GH$ are formed by taking $G$ times the columns of $H$ $ G· ([    ... ... vec(h)_1 ·s vec(h)_n ... ... ]) =([ ... ... G· vec(h)_1 ·s G·vec(h)_n ... ... ]) $ and the rows of $GH$ are formed by taking the rows of $G$ times $H$ $ ([ ·s vec(g)_1 ·s rule[-1.25ex]{0pt}{2ex}  ... [.5ex]  ·s vec(g)_r ·s ])· H =([ ·s vec(g)_1· H ·srule[-1.25ex]{0pt}{2ex}  ...rule[-1ex]{0pt}{2ex} [.5ex]  ·s vec(g)_r· H ·s ]) $ (ignoring the extra parentheses).      We will check that in a product of $N by N$ matrices, the rows of the product equal the product of the rows of~$G$ with the entire matrix~$H$. $ ([ g_{1,1} g_{1,2} g_{2,1} g_{2,2} ]) ([ h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} ]) =([ [g_{1,1] g_{1,2}}H [g_{2,1] g_{2,2}}H ]) = ([ [g_{1,1]h_{1,1}+g_{1,2}h_{2,1} g_{1,1}h_{1,2}+g_{1,2}h_{2,2}} [g_{2,1]h_{1,1}+g_{2,2}h_{2,1} g_{2,1}h_{1,2}+g_{2,2}h_{2,2}} ]) $ We leave the more general check as an exercise.    An application of those observations is that there is a matrix that just copies out the rows and columns.    The main diagonal (or principle diagonal or diagonal) of a square matrix goes from the upper left to the lower right.      An identity matrix is square and every entry is $0$ except for $1$'s in the main diagonal. $ I_{N by N}= ([ 1 0 ... 0 0 1 ... 0 ... 0 0 ... 1 ]) $    For example Here is the $ N by N $ identity matrix leaving its multiplicand unchanged when it acts from the right. $ ([ 1 -2 0 -2 1 -1 4 3 ]) ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 1 -2 0 -2 1 -1 4 3 ]) $   For example Here the $ N by N $ identity leaves its multiplicand unchanged both from the left $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 2 3 6 1 3 8 -7 1 0 ]) = ([ 2 3 6 1 3 8 -7 1 0 ]) $ and from the right. $ ([ 2 3 6 1 3 8 -7 1 0 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 2 3 6 1 3 8 -7 1 0 ]) $   In short, an identity matrix is the identity element of the set of $N by N$ matrices with respect to the operation of matrix multiplication.  We can generalize the identity matrix by relaxing the ones to arbitrary reals. The resulting matrix rescales whole rows or columns.    A diagonal matrix is square and has $0$'s off the main diagonal. $ ([ a_{1,1} 0 ... 0 0 a_{2,2} ... 0 ... 0 0 ... a_{n,n} ]) $    For example From the left, the action of multiplication by a diagonal matrix is to rescales the rows. $ ([ 2 0 0 -1 ]) ([ 2 1 4 -1 -1 3 4 4 ]) = ([ 4 2 8 -2 1 -3 -4 -4 ]) $ From the right such a matrix rescales the columns. $ ([ 1 2 1 2 2 2 ]) ([ 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 -2 ]) = ([ 3 4 -2 6 4 -4 ]) $   We can also generalize identity matrices by putting a single one in each row and column in ways other than putting them down the diagonal.    A permutation matrix  is square and is all $0$'s except for a single~$1$ in each row and column.    For example From the left these matrices permute rows. $ ([ 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]) = ([ 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]) $ From the right they permute columns. $ ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]) ([ 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) = ([ 2 3 1 5 6 4 8 9 7 ]) $   We finish this subsection by applying these observations to get matrices that perform Gauss's Method and Gauss-Jordan reduction. We have already seen how to produce a matrix that rescales rows, and a row swapper.  For example Multiplying by this matrix rescales the second row by three. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 0 2 1 1 0 1/3 1 -1 1 0 2 0 ]) = ([ 0 2 1 1 0 1 3 -3 1 0 2 0 ]) $   For example This multiplication swaps the first and third rows. $ ([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]) ([ 0 2 1 1 0 1 3 -3 1 0 2 0 ]) = ([ 1 0 2 0 0 1 3 -3 0 2 1 1 ]) $   To see how to perform a row combination, we observe something about those two examples. The matrix that rescales the second row by a factor of three arises in this way from the identity. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) for step $3ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 ]) $ Similarly, the matrix that swaps first and third rows arises in this way. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) for step $ρ_1↔ρ_3$ ([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]) $  For example The $ N by N $ matrix that arises as $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) for step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 -2 1 ]) $ will, when it acts from the left, perform the combination operation $ -2ρ_2+ρ_3 $. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 -2 1 ]) ([ 1 0 2 0 0 1 3 -3 0 2 1 1 ]) = ([ 1 0 2 0 0 1 3 -3 0 0 -5 7 ]) $     The elementary reduction matrices  (or just elementary matrices)  result from applying a one Gaussian operation to an identity matrix.  $ Ifor step $kρ_i$M_i(k) $ for $ k ≠ 0 $ $ Ifor step $ρ_i↔ρ_j$P_{i,j} $ for $ i ≠ j $ $ Ifor step $kρ_i+ρ_j$C_{i,j}(k) $ for $ i ≠ j $       Matrix multiplication can do Gaussian reduction.  If $ Hfor step $kρ_i$G $ then $ M_i(k)H=G $. If $ Hfor step $ρ_i↔ρ_j$G $ then $ P_{i,j}H=G $. If $ Hfor step $kρ_i+ρ_j$G $ then $ C_{i,j}(k)H=G $.      Clear.   For example This is the first system, from the first chapter, on which we performed Gauss's Method. $ $ 3x_3 = 9 x_1 + 5x_2 - 2x_3 = 2 (1/3)x_1 + 2x_2 = 3 $ $ We can reduce it with matrix multiplication. Swap the first and third rows, $ ([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]) ([ 0 0 3 9 1 5 -2 2 1/3 2 0 3 ]) = ([ 1/3 2 0 3 1 5 -2 2 0 0 3 9 ]) $ triple the first row, $ ([ 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1/3 2 0 3 1 5 -2 2 0 0 3 9 ]) = ([ 1 6 0 9 1 5 -2 2 0 0 3 9 ]) $ and then add $ -1 $ times the first row to the second. $ ([ 1 0 0 -1 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 6 0 9 1 5 -2 2 0 0 3 9 ]) = ([ 1 6 0 9 0 -1 -2 -7 0 0 3 9 ]) $ Now back substitution will give the solution.   For example Gauss-Jordan reduction works the same way. For the matrix ending the prior example, first turn the leading entries to ones, $ ([ 1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 1/3 ]) ([ 1 6 0 9 0 -1 -2 -7 0 0 3 9 ]) = ([ 1 6 0 9 0 1 2 7 0 0 1 3 ]) $ then clear the third column, and then the second column. $ ([ 1 -6 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 -2 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 6 0 9 0 1 2 7 0 0 1 3 ]) = ([ 1 0 0 3 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 ]) $        For any matrix $ H $ there are elementary reduction matrices $ R_1 $, ..., $ R_r $ such that $ R_r· R_{r-1}·s R_1· H $ is in reduced echelon form.    Until now we have taken the point of view that our primary objects of study are vector spaces and the maps between them, and we seemed to have adopted matrices only for computational convenience. This subsection show that this isn't the entire story.  Understanding matrices operations by understanding the mechanics of how the entries combine is also useful. In the rest of this book we shall continue to focus on maps as the primary objects but we will be pragmatic- if the matrix point of view gives some clearer idea then we will go with it.     Predict the result of each multiplication by an elementary reduction matrix, and then check by multiplying it out.  $ ([ 3 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) $ $ ([ 1 0 0 2 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) $ $ ([ 1 0 -2 1 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) $ $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) ([ 1 -1 0 1 ]) $ $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) ([ 0 1 1 0 ]) $    The second matrix has its first row multiplied by $ 3 $. $ ([ 3 6 3 4 ]) $ The second matrix has its second row multiplied by $ 2 $. $ ([ 1 2 6 8 ]) $ The second matrix undergoes the combination operation of replacing the second row with $ -2 $ times the first row added to the second. $ ([ 1 2 1 0 ]) $ The first matrix undergoes the column operation of:~replace the second column by $-1$ times the first column plus the second. $ ([ 1 1 3 1 ]) $ The first matrix has its columns swapped. $ ([ 2 1 4 3 ]) $    Predict the result of each multiplication by a diagonal matrix, and then check by multiplying it out.  $ ([ 3 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) $ $ ([ 4 0 0 2 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) $    The second matrix has its first row multiplied by $ 3 $ and its second row multiplied by $ 0 $. $ ([ 3 6 0 0 ]) $ The second matrix has its first row multiplied by $ 4 $ and its second row multiplied by $ 2 $. $ ([ 4 8 6 8 ]) $   Produce each.  a $N by N$ matrix that, acting from the left, swaps rows one and two a $N by N$ matrix that, acting from the right, swaps column one and two    This matrix swaps row one and row three. $ ([ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ a b c d e f g h i ]) = ([ d e f a b c g h i ]) $ This matrix swaps column one and two. $ ([ a b c d ]) ([ 0 1 1 0 ]) = ([ b a d c ]) $   Show how to use matrix multiplication to bring this matrix to echelon form. $ ([ 1 2 1 0 2 3 1 -1 7 11 4 -3 ]) $  Multiply by $C_{1,2}(-2)$, then by~$C_{1,3}(-7)$, and then by~$C_{2,3}(-3)$, paying attention to the right-to-left order. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 -3 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 -7 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 -2 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 2 1 0 2 3 1 -1 7 11 4 -3 ]) = ([ 1 2 1 0 0 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 ]) $   Find the product of this matrix with its transpose. $ ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) sin(θ) cos(θ) ]) $  The product is the identity matrix (recall that $cos^2(θ+)sin^2(θ) =1$). An explanation is that the given matrix represents, with respect to the standard bases, a rotation in $ ℝ^2 $ of $ θ $ radians while the transpose represents a rotation of $ -θ $ radians. The two cancel.   The need to take linear combinations of rows and columns in tables of numbers arises often in practice. For instance, this is a map of part of Vermont and New York.   {In part because of Lake Champlain, there are no roads directly connecting some pairs of towns. For instance, there is no way to go from Winooski to Grand Isle without going through Colchester. (To simplify the graph many other roads and towns have been omitted. From top to bottom of this map is about forty miles.)}  { }   The adjacency matrix  of a map is the square matrix whose $ i,j $ entry is the number of roads from city $ i $ to city $ j $ (all $(i,i)$ entries are~$0$). Produce the adjacency matrix of this map, with the cities in alphabetical order. A matrix is symmetric if it equals its transpose. Show that an adjacency matrix is symmetric. (These are all two-way streets. Vermont doesn't have many one-way streets.) What is the significance of the square of the incidence matrix? The cube?    The adjacency matrix is this (e.g, the first row shows that there is only one connection including Burlington, the road to Winooski). $ ([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 ]) $ Because these are two-way roads, any road connecting city~$ i $ to city~$ j $ gives a connection between city~$ j $ and city~$ i $. The square of the adjacency matrix tells how cities are connected by trips involving two roads.    This table gives the number of hours of each type done by each worker, and the associated pay rates. Use matrices to compute the wages due.  [t] \ {regular} {overtime}  Alan 40 12 Betty 35 6 Catherine 40 18 Donald 28 0   [t] {wage}  regular $$ 25.00$ overtime $$ 45.00$   Remark. This illustrates that in practice we often want to compute linear combinations of rows and columns in a context where we really aren't interested in any associated linear maps.  The pay due each person appears in the matrix product of the two arrays.  Express this nonsingular matrix as a product of elementary reduction matrices. $ T=([ 1 2 0 2 -1 0 3 1 2 ]) $  The Gauss-Jordan reduction is routine. $ ([ 1 2 0 2 -1 0 3 1 2 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ for step $-(1/5)ρ_2$ for step $-2ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $ Thus we know elementary reduction matrices $R_1,...,R_6$ such that $R_6· R_5·s R_1· T=I$. Move the matrices to the other side, paying attention to order. For instance, first multiply both sides from the left by $R_6^{-1}$ to get $(R_6^{-1}R_6)· R_5·s R_1· T=R_6^{-1}I$, which simplifies to $R_5·s R_1· T=R_6^{-1}$, etc. $ T= ([ 1 0 0 -2 1 0 0 0 1 ])^{-1} ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 -3 0 1 ])^{-1} ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 -1 1 ])^{-1} · ([ 1 0 0 0 -1/5 0 0 0 1 ])^{-1} ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1/2 ])^{-1} ([ 1 -2 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ])^{-1} $ Then just remember how to take the inverse of an elementary reduction matrix. For instance, $C_{i,j}(k)^{-1}=C_{i,j}(-k)$. $ = ([ 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 3 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 -5 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 ]) ([ 1 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $   Express $ ([ 1 0 -3 3 ]) $ as the product of two elementary reduction matrices.  One way to produce this matrix from the identity is to use the column operations of first multiplying the second column by three, and then adding the negative of the resulting second column to the first. $ ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) for step $$ ([ 1 0 0 3 ]) for step $$ ([ 1 0 -3 3 ]) $ In contrast with row operations, column operations are written from left to right, so this matrix product expresses doing the above two operations. $ ([ 1 0 0 3 ]) ([ 1 0 -1 1 ]) $ Remark. Alternatively, we could get the required matrix with row operations. Starting with the identity, first adding the negative of the first row to the second, and then multiplying the second row by three will work. Because we write successive row operations as matrix products from right to left, doing these two row operations is expressed with:~the same matrix product.   Prove that the diagonal matrices form a subspace of $ matspace(_){N by N} $. What is its dimension?  The set of diagonal matrices is nonempty as the zero matrix is diagonal. Clearly it is closed under scalar multiples and sums. Therefore it is a subspace. The dimension is $ n $; here is a basis. $ {([ 1 0 ... 0 0 ... 0 0 0 ]),..., ([ 0 0 ... 0 0 ... 0 0 1 ]) } $   Does the identity matrix represent the identity map if the bases are unequal?  No. In $ polyspace(_1) $, with respect to the unequal bases $ B=1,x $ and $ D=1+x,1-x $, the identity transformation is represented by this matrix. $ Representation of (id)= ([ 1/2 1/2 1/2 -1/2 ])_{B,D} $   Show that every multiple of the identity commutes with every square matrix. Are there other matrices that commute with all square matrices?  For any scalar $ r $ and square matrix $ H $ we have $ (rI)H=r(IH)=rH=r(HI)=(Hr)I=H(rI) $.  There are no other such matrices; here is an argument for $N by N$ matrices that is easily extended to $N by N$. If a matrix commutes with all others then it commutes with this unit matrix. $ ([ 0 a 0 c ]) =([ a b c d ]) ([ 0 1 0 0 ]) =([ 0 1 0 0 ]) ([ a b c d ]) =([ c d 0 0 ]) $ From this we first conclude that the upper left entry~$a$ must equal its lower right entry~$d$. We also conclude that the lower left entry~$c$ is zero. The argument for the upper right entry~$b$ is similar.   Prove or disprove: nonsingular matrices commute.  It is false; these two don't commute. $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ])  ([ 5 6 7 8 ]) $   Show that the product of a permutation matrix and its transpose is an identity matrix.  A permutation matrix has a single one in each row and column, and all its other entries are zeroes. Fix such a matrix. Suppose that the $ i $-th row has its one in its $ j $-th column. Then no other row has its one in the $ j $-th column; every other row has a zero in the $ j $-th column. Thus the dot product of the $ i $-th row and any other row is zero.  The $ i $-th row of the product is made up of the dot products of the $ i $-th row of the matrix and the columns of the transpose. By the last paragraph, all such dot products are zero except for the $ i $-th one, which is one.   Show that if the first and second rows of $ G $ are equal then so are the first and second rows of $ GH $. Generalize.  The generalization is to go from the first and second rows to the $i_1$-th and $i_2$-th rows. Row~$i$ of $ GH $ is made up of the dot products of row~$i$ of $ G $ and the columns of $ H $. Thus if rows $ i_1 $ and $ i_2 $ of $ G $ are equal then so are rows $ i_1 $ and $ i_2 $ of $ GH $.   Describe the product of two diagonal matrices.  If the product of two diagonal matrices is defined- if both are $N by N$- then the product of the diagonals is the diagonal of the products:~where $ G,H $ are equal-sized diagonal matrices, $ GH $ is all zeros except each that $ i,i $ entry is $ g_{i,i}h_{i,i} $.   Show that if $ G $ has a row of zeros then $ GH $ (if defined) has a row of zeros. Does that work for columns?  The $ i $-th row of $ GH $ is made up of the dot products of the $ i $-th row of $ G $ with the columns of $ H $. The dot product of a zero row with a column is zero.  It works for columns if stated correctly:~if $ H $ has a column of zeros then $ GH $ (if defined) has a column of zeros. The proof is easy.   Show that the set of unit matrices forms a basis for $ matspace(_){N by M} $.  Perhaps the easiest way is to show that each $ N by M $ matrix is a linear combination of unit matrices in one and only one way: $ c_1([ 1 0 ... 0 0 ... ]) +...+ c_{n,m}([ 0 0 ... ... 0 ... 1 ]) =([ a_{1,1} a_{1,2} ... ... a_{n,1} ... a_{n,m} ]) $ has the unique solution $ c_1=a_{1,1} $, $ c_2=a_{1,2} $, etc.   Find the formula for the $n$-th power of this matrix. $ ([ 1 1 1 0 ]) $  Call that matrix $ F $. We have $ F^2=([ 2 1 1 1 ])  F^3=([ 3 2 2 1 ])  F^4=([ 5 3 3 2 ]) $ In general, $ F^n=([ f_{n+1} f_n f_n f_{n-1} ]) $ where $ f_i $ is the $ i $-th Fibonacci number $ f_i=f_{i-1}+f_{i-2} $ and $ f_0=0 $, $ f_1=1 $, which we verify by induction, based on this equation. $ ([ f_{i-1} f_{i-2} f_{i-2} f_{i-3} ]) ([ 1 1 1 0 ]) =([ f_i f_{i-1} f_{i-1} f_{i-2} ]) $   The trace of a square matrix is the sum of the entries on its diagonal (its significance appears in Chapter Five). Show that $ tr (GH)=tr (HG) $.  textit{Chapter Five gives a less computational reason- the trace of a matrix is the second coefficient in its characteristic polynomial- but for now we can use indices.} We have $ tr (GH) =(g_{1,1}h_{1,1}+g_{1,2}h_{2,1}+...+g_{1,n}h_{n,1}) +(g_{2,1}h_{1,2}+g_{2,2}h_{2,2}+...+g_{2,n}h_{n,2})  +·s+(g_{n,1}h_{1,n}+g_{n,2}h_{2,n}+...+g_{n,n}h_{n,n}) $ while $ tr (HG) =(h_{1,1}g_{1,1}+h_{1,2}g_{2,1}+...+h_{1,n}g_{n,1}) +(h_{2,1}g_{1,2}+h_{2,2}g_{2,2}+...+h_{2,n}g_{n,2})  +·s+(h_{n,1}g_{1,n}+h_{n,2}g_{2,n}+...+h_{n,n}g_{n,n}) $ and the two are equal.   A square matrix is upper triangular  if its only nonzero entries lie above, or on, the diagonal. Show that the product of two upper triangular matrices is upper triangular. Does this hold for lower triangular also?  A matrix is upper triangular if and only if its $i,j$ entry is zero whenever $ i>j $. Thus, if $ G,H $ are upper triangular then $ h_{i,j} $ and $ g_{i,j} $ are zero when $ i>j $. An entry in the product $ p_{i,j}=g_{i,1}h_{1,j}+...+g_{i,n}h_{n,j} $ is zero unless at least some of the terms are nonzero, that is, unless for at least some of the summands $ g_{i,r}h_{r,j} $ both $ i≤ r $ and $ r≤ j $. Of course, if $ i>j $ this cannot happen and so the product of two upper triangular matrices is upper triangular. (A similar argument works for lower triangular matrices.)   A square matrix is a Markov matrix if each entry is between zero and one and the sum along each row is one. Prove that a product of Markov matrices is Markov.  The sum along the $ i $-th row of the product is this. $ p_{i,1}+·s+p_{i,n} =(h_{i,1}g_{1,1}+h_{i,2}g_{2,1}+...+h_{i,n}g_{n,1}) +(h_{i,1}g_{1,2}+h_{i,2}g_{2,2}+...+h_{i,n}g_{n,2})  +...+(h_{i,1}g_{1,n}+h_{i,2}g_{2,n}+...+h_{i,n}g_{n,n}) =h_{i,1}(g_{1,1}+g_{1,2}+...+g_{1,n}) +h_{i,2}(g_{2,1}+g_{2,2}+...+g_{2,n})  +...+h_{i,n}(g_{n,1}+g_{n,2}+...+g_{n,n}) =h_{i,1}· 1+...+h_{i,n}· 1 =1 $   Give an example of two matrices of the same rank and size with squares of differing rank.  Matrices representing (say, with respect to $ stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)⊆ ℝ^2 $) the maps that send $ vec(β)_1 h ↓ vec(β)_1  vec(β)_2 h ↓ 0 $ and $ vec(β)_1 g ↓ vec(β)_2  vec(β)_2 g ↓ 0 $ will do.                                 On a computer multiplications have traditionally been more costly than additions, so people have tried to in reduce the number of multiplications used to compute a matrix product.  How many real number multiplications do we need in the formula we gave for the product of a $ N by M $ matrix and a $ N by M $ matrix?  Matrix multiplication is associative, so all associations yield the same result. The cost in number of multiplications, however, varies. Find the association requiring the fewest real number multiplications to compute the matrix product of a $ N by M $ matrix, a $ N by M $ matrix, a $ N by M $ matrix, and a $ N by M $ matrix. (Very hard.) Find a way to multiply two $ N by N $ matrices using only seven multiplications instead of the eight suggested by the naive approach.    Each entry $p_{i,j}=g_{i,1}h_{1,j}+...+g_{1,r}h_{r,1} $ takes $ r $ multiplications and there are $ m· n $ entries. Thus there are $ m· n· r $ multiplications. Let $ H_1 $ be $ N by M $, let $ H_2 $ be $ N by M $, let $ H_3 $ be $ N by M $, let $ H_4 $ be $ N by M $. Then, using the formula from the prior part,   {this association} {uses this many multiplications}  $ ((H_1H_2)H_3)H_4 $ 1000+500+25=1525 $ $ (H_1(H_2H_3))H_4 $ 1000+250+25=1275 $ $ (H_1H_2)(H_3H_4) $ 1000+100+100=1200 $ $ H_1(H_2(H_3H_4)) $ 100+200+50=350 $ $ H_1((H_2H_3)H_4) $ 1000+50+50=1100 $   shows which is cheapest. This is an improvement by S.~Winograd of a formula due to V.~Strassen: let $ w=aA-(a-c-d)(A-C+D) $ and then $ ([ a b c d ]) ([ A B C D ]) = ([ α β γ δ ]) $ where $α=aA+bB$, and $β=w+(c+d)(C-A)+(a+b-c-d)D$, and $γ=w+(a-c)(D-C)-d(A-B-C+D)$, and $δ=w+(a-c)(D-C)+(c+d)(C-A)$.       This takes seven multiplications and fifteen additions (save the intermediate results).     If $ A $ and $ B $ are square matrices of the same size such that $ ABAB=0 $, does it follow that $ BABA=0 $?   No, it does not. Let $ A $ and $ B $ represent, with respect to the standard bases, these transformations of $ ℝ^3 $. $ [x y z]a ↓[x y 0]  [x y z]a ↓[0 x y] $ Observe that $ [x y z]abab ↓[0 0 0] but [x y z]baba ↓[0 0 x]. $    Demonstrate these four assertions to get an alternate proof that column rank equals row rank.  $ vec(y)·vec(y)=0 $ iff $ vec(y)=0 $. $ Avec(x)=0 $ iff $ AᵀAvec(x)=0 $. $ dim(A)=dim(AᵀA) $. $ col rank(A)=col rank(Aᵀ) =row rank(A) $.     Obvious. If $ AᵀAvec(x)=0 $ then $ vec(y)·vec(y)=0 $ where $ vec(y)=Avec(x) $. Hence $ vec(y)=0 $ by (a).  The converse is obvious. By (b), $ Avec(x)_1 $,...,$ Avec(x)_n $ are linearly independent iff $ AᵀAvec(x)_1 $,..., $ AᵀAvec(v)_n $ are linearly independent. We have $ col rank(A)=col rank(AᵀA) =dim{trans{{A}(Avec{{x}) such that {all $vec{{x$} } ≤ dim{trans{{A}vec{{y} such that {all $vec{{y$} } =col rank(Aᵀ). $ Thus also $ col rank(Aᵀ) ≤col rank(trans(Aᵀ)) $ and so $ col rank(A)=col rank(Aᵀ) =row rank(A) $.     Prove (where $ A $ is an $ N by N $ matrix and so defines a transformation of any $ n $-dimensional space $ V $ with respect to $ B,B $ where $ B $ is a basis) that $ dim(A intersectionνllspace{A}) =dim(A)-dim(A^2) $. Conclude  $ νllspace{A}⊆A $ iff $ dim(νllspace{A})=dim(A) -dim(A^2) $; $ A⊆νllspace{A} $ iff $ A^2=0 $; $ A=νllspace{A} $ iff $ A^2=0 $ and $ dim(νllspace{A})=dim(A) $ ; $ dim(A intersectionνllspace{A})=0 $ iff $ dim(A)=dim(A^2) $ ; textit{(Requires the Direct Sum subsection, which is optional.)} $ V=A⊕νllspace{A} $ iff $ dim(A)=dim(A^2) $.    Let $ sequence{vec(z)_1,...,vec(z)_k} $ be a basis for $ A intersectionνllspace{A} $ ($ k $ might be $ 0 $). Let $ vec(x)_1,...,vec(x)_k in V $ be such that $ Avec(x)_i=vec(z)_i $. Note $ {Avec{{x}_1,...,Avec{{x}_k} $ is linearly independent, and extend to a basis for $ A $: $ Avec(x)_1,...,Avec(x)_k,Avec(x)_{k+1},...,Avec(x)_{r_1} $ where $ r_1=dim(A) $.  Now take $ vec(x) in V $. Write $ Avec(x)=a_1(Avec(x)_1)+...+a_{r_1}(Avec(x)_{r_1}) $ and so $ A^2vec(x)=a_1(A^2vec(x)_1)+...+a_{r_1}(A^2vec(x)_{r_1}). $ But $ Avec(x)_1,...,Avec(x)_k inνllspace{A} $, so $ A^2vec(x)_1=0,...,A^2vec(x)_k=0 $ and we now know $ A^2vec(x)_{k+1},...,A^2vec(x)_{r_1} $ spans $ A^2 $.  To see $ {A^2vec{{x}_{{k+1},...,A^2vec{{x}_{{r_1}} $ is linearly independent, write $ b_{k+1}A^2vec(x)_{k+1}+...+b_{r_1}A^2vec(x)_{r_1} =0 A[b_{k+1}Avec(x)_{k+1}+...+b_{r_1}Avec(x)_{r_1}] =0 $ and, since $ b_{k+1}Avec(x)_{k+1}+...+b_{r_1}Avec(x)_{r_1} inνllspace{A} $ we get a contradiction unless it is $ 0 $ (clearly it is in $ A $, but $ Avec(x)_1,...,Avec(x)_k $ is a basis for $ A intersectionνllspace{A} $).  Hence $ dim(A^2)=r_1-k=dim(A)- dim(A intersectionνllspace{A}) $.                             We finish this section by considering how to represent the inverse of a linear map.   We first recall some things about inverses.     Where $ π: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2 $ is the projection map and $ ι: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3 $ is the embedding $ [x y z] π ↓ [x y]  [x y] ι ↓ [x y 0] $ then the composition $∘{π}{ι}$ is the identity map $∘{π}{ι}=I$ on $ ℝ^2$. $  [x y] ι ↓ [x y 0] π ↓ [x y] $ We say that $ι$ is a right inverse of $π$ or, what is the same thing, that $π$ is a left inverse of $ι$.   However, composition in the other order $∘{ι}{π}$ doesn't give the identity map- here is a vector that is not sent to itself under $∘{ι}{π}$. $  [0 0 1] π ↓ [0 0] ι ↓ [0 0 0] $   In fact, $π$ has no left inverse at all. For, if $f$ were to be a left inverse of $π$ then we would have $  [x y z] π ↓ [x y] f ↓ [x y z] $ for all of the infinitely many $z$'s. But a function~$f$ cannot send a single argument $(x choose y)$ to more than one value.   So a function can have a right inverse but no left inverse, or a left inverse but no right inverse. A function can also fail to have an inverse on either side; one example is the zero transformation on $ ℝ^2$.     Some functions have a two-sided inverse, another function that is the inverse both from the left and from the right. For instance, the transformation given by $vec(v)↦ 2· vec(v)$ has the two-sided inverse $vec(v)↦ (1/2)·vec(v)$.   The appendix shows that a function has a two-sided inverse if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto. The appendix also shows that if a function $f$ has a two-sided inverse then it is unique, so we call it `the'~inverse and write $f^{-1}$.    In addition, recall that we have shown in Theorem~II. that if a linear map has a two-sided inverse then that inverse is also linear.    Thus, our goal in this subsection is, where a linear $h$ has an inverse, to find the relationship between $Representation of (h)$ and $rep{h^{-1}}{D,B}$.     A matrix $ G $ is a left inverse matrix of the matrix $ H $ if $ GH $ is the identity matrix. It is a right inverse if $ HG $ is the identity. A matrix $H$ with a two-sided inverse is an invertible matrix. That two-sided inverse is denoted $ H^{-1} $.    Because of the correspondence between linear maps and matrices, statements about map inverses translate into statements about matrix inverses.    If a matrix has both a left inverse and a right inverse then the two are equal.       A matrix is invertible if and only if it is nonsingular.      (For both results.) Given a matrix $H$, fix spaces of appropriate dimension for the domain and codomain and fix bases for these spaces. With respect to these bases, $H$ represents a map $h$. The statements are true about the map and therefore they are true about the matrix.      A product of invertible matrices is invertible:~if $ G $ and $ H $ are invertible and $ GH $ is defined then $ GH $ is invertible and $ (GH)^{-1}=H^{-1}G^{-1} $.       Because the two matrices are invertible they are square, and because their product is defined they must both be $N by N$. Fix spaces and bases- say, $ ℝ^n$ with the standard bases- to get maps $g,h: ℝ^n → ℝ^n$ that are associated with the matrices, $G=Representation of (g)$ and $H=Representation of (h)$.    Consider $h^{-1}g^{-1}$. By the prior paragraph this composition is defined. This map is a two-sided inverse of $ gh $ since $ (h^{-1}g^{-1})(gh) = h^{-1}(I)h =h^{-1}h =I $ and $ (gh)(h^{-1}g^{-1}) = g(I)g^{-1} =gg^{-1} =I $. The matrices representing the maps reflect this equality.    This is the arrow diagram giving the relationship between map inverses and matrix inverses. It is a special case of the diagram relating function composition to matrix multiplication. skip     Beyond its place in our program of seeing how to represent map operations, another reason for our interest in inverses comes from linear systems. A linear system is equivalent to a matrix equation, as here. $ $ x_1 + x_2 = 3 2x_1 - x_2 = 2 $ Longleftrightarrow ([ 1 1 2 -1 ]) [x_1 x_2] = [3 2]  $ By fixing spaces and bases (for instance, $ ℝ^2, ℝ^2$ with the standard bases), we take the matrix $H$ to represent a map $h$. The matrix equation then becomes this linear map equation. $ h(vec(x))=vec(d)  $ If we had a left inverse map~$g$ then we could apply it to both sides $∘{g}{h}(vec(x))=g(vec(d))$ to get $vec(x)=g(vec(d))$. Restating in terms of the matrices, we want to multiply by the inverse matrix $Representation of (g)·rep{vec(d)}{C}$ to get $rep{vec(x)}{B}$.  For example We can find a left inverse for the matrix just given $ ([ m n p q ]) ([ 1 1 2 -1 ]) = ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ by using Gauss's Method to solve the resulting linear system. $ $ m + 2n = 1 m - n = 0 p + 2q = 0 p - q = 1 $ $ Answer: $ m=1/3 $, $ n=1/3 $, $ p=2/3 $, and $ q=-1/3 $. (This matrix is actually the two-sided inverse of $H$; the check is easy.) With it, we can solve the system from the prior example. $ [x y] =([ 1/3 1/3 2/3 -1/3 ]) [3 2] =[5/3 4/3] $    Why do inverse matrices when we have Gauss's Method?     Beyond the conceptual appeal of representing the map inverse operation, solving linear systems this way has two advantages.  First, once we have done the work of finding an inverse then solving a system with the same coefficients but different constants is fast:~if we change the constants on the right of the system above then we get a related problem $ ([ 1 1 2 -1 ]) [x y] = [5 1] $ that our inverse method solves quickly. $ [x y] = ([ 1/3 1/3 2/3 -1/3 ]) [5 1] = [2 3] $    Another advantage of inverses is that we can explore a system's sensitivity to changes in the constants. For example, tweaking the $3$ on the right of the prior example's system to $ ([ 1 1 2 -1 ]) [x_1 x_2] = [3.01 2] $ and solving with the inverse $ ([ 1/3 1/3 2/3 -1/3 ]) [3.01 2] = [(1/3)(3.01)+(1/3)(2) (2/3)(3.01)-(1/3)(2)] $ shows that the first component of the solution changes by $ 1/3 $ of the tweak, while the second component moves by $ 2/3 $ of the tweak. This is sensitivity analysis . We could use it to decide how accurately we must specify the data in a linear model to ensure that the solution has a desired accuracy.        A matrix $H$ is invertible if and only if it can be written as the product of elementary reduction matrices. We can compute the inverse by applying to the identity matrix the same row steps, in the same order, that Gauss-Jordan reduce $H$.      The matrix $H$ is invertible if and only if it is nonsingular and thus Gauss-Jordan reduces to the identity. By we can do this reduction with elementary matrices. $ R_r· R_{r-1}... R_1· H=I  $    For the first sentence of the result, note that elementary matrices are invertible because elementary row operations are reversible, and that their inverses are also elementary. Apply $R_r^{-1}$ from the left to both sides of ($*$). Then apply $R_{r-1}^{-1}$, etc. The result gives $H$ as the product of elementary matrices $H=R_1^{-1}·s R_r^{-1}· I$. (The $I$ there covers the case $r=0$.)    For the second sentence, group~($*$) as $(R_r· R_{r-1}... R_1)· H=I$ and recognize what's in the parentheses as the inverse $H^{-1}=R_r· R_{r-1}... R_1· I$. Restated: applying $R_1$ to the identity, followed by $R_2$, etc., yields the inverse of $H$.    For example To find the inverse of $ ([ 1 1 2 -1 ]) $ do Gauss-Jordan reduction, meanwhile performing the same operations on the identity. For clerical convenience we write the matrix and the identity side-by-side and do the reduction steps together. $ ([ 1 1 1 0 2 -1 0 1 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 1 0 0 -3 -2 1 ]) for step $-1/3ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 1 0 0 1 2/3 -1/3 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 1/3 1/3 0 1 2/3 -1/3 ]) $ This calculation has found the inverse. $ ([ 1 1 2 -1 ])^{-1} = ([ 1/3 1/3 2/3 -1/3 ]) $   For example This one happens to start with a row swap. $ ([ 0 3 -1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 -1 0 0 0 1 ]) for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 3 -1 1 0 0 1 -1 0 0 0 1 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 3 -1 1 0 0 0 -1 -1 0 -1 1 ]) ... for step $$ ([ 1 0 0 1/4 1/4 3/4 0 1 0 1/4 1/4 -1/4 0 0 1 -1/4 3/4 -3/4 ]) $   For example This algorithm detects a non-invertible matrix when the left half won't reduce to the identity. $ ([ 1 1 1 0 2 2 0 1 ]) for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 1 0 0 0 -2 1 ]) $   With this procedure we can give a formula for the inverse of a general $N by N$ matrix, which is worth memorizing.      The inverse for a $ N by N $ matrix exists and equals $ ([ a b c d ])^{-1} = (1/ad-bc) ([ d -b -c a ]) $ if and only if $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $.     This computation is .    We have seen in this subsection, as in the subsection on Mechanics of Matrix Multiplication, how to exploit the correspondence between linear maps and matrices. We can fruitfully study both maps and matrices, translating back and forth to use whichever is handiest.  Over the course of this entire section we have developed an algebra system for matrices. We can compare it with the familiar algebra of real numbers. Matrix addition and subtraction work in much the same way as the real number operations except that they only combine same-sized matrices. Scalar multiplication is in some ways an extension of real number multiplication. We also have a matrix multiplication operation and its inverse that are somewhat like the familiar real number operations (associativity, and distributivity over addition, for example), but there are differences (failure of commutativity). This section provides an example that algebra systems other than the usual real number one can be interesting and useful.     Supply the intermediate steps in .  Here is one way to proceed. Follow $ for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 3 -1 1 0 0 1 -1 0 0 0 1 ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 3 -1 1 0 0 0 -1 -1 0 -1 1 ]) $ with $ for step $(1/3)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 3 -1 1 0 0 0 0 -4/3 1/3 -1 1 ]) for step $(1/3)ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 -1/3 1/3 0 0 0 0 1 -1/4 3/4 -3/4 ]) for step $(1/3)ρ_3+ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 0 1/4 1/4 3/4 0 1 0 1/4 1/4 -1/4 0 0 1 -1/4 3/4 -3/4 ]) $ and read the answer off of the right side.   Use to decide if each matrix has an inverse.   $([ 2 1 -1 1 ])$  $([ 0 4 1 -3 ])$  $([ 2 -3 -4 6 ])$    Yes, it has an inverse: $ad-bc=2· 1-1·(-1) ≠ 0$. Yes. No.    For each invertible matrix in the prior problem, use to find its inverse.    $ (1/2· 1-1· (-1)) ·([ 1 -1 1 2 ]) =( 1/ 3)·([ 1 -1 1 2 ]) =([ 1/3 -1/3 1/3 2/3 ])$  $ (1/0· (-3)-4· 1) ·([ -3 -4 -1 0 ]) =([ 3/4 1 1/4 0 ])$ The prior question shows that no inverse exists.    Find the inverse, if it exists, by using the Gauss-Jordan Method. Check the answers for the $N by N$ matrices with .  $([ 3 1 0 2 ])$ $ ([ 2 1/2 3 1 ]) $ $ ([ 2 -4 -1 2 ]) $ $ ([ 1 1 3 0 2 4 -1 1 0 ]) $ $ ([ 0 1 5 0 -2 4 2 3 -2 ]) $ $ ([ 2 2 3 1 -2 -3 4 -2 -3 ]) $    The reduction is routine. $ ([ 3 1 1 0 0 2 0 1 ]) for step $(1/3)ρ_1$ ([ 1 1/3 1/3 0 0 1 0 1/2 ]) for step $-(1/3)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 1/3 -1/6 0 1 0 1/2 ]) $ This answer agrees with the answer from the check. $ ([ 3 1 0 2 ])^{-1} =(1/3· 2-0· 1)· ([ 2 -1 0 3 ]) =(1/6)· ([ 2 -1 0 3 ]) $ This reduction is easy. $ ([ 2 1/2 1 0 3 1 0 1 ]) for step $-(3/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 2 1/2 1 0 0 1/4 -3/2 1 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ ([ 1 1/4 1/2 0 0 1 -6 4 ]) for step $-(1/4)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 2 -1 0 1 -6 4 ]) $ The check agrees. $ (1/2· 1-3· (1/2))· ([ 1 -1/2 -3 2 ]) =2· ([ 1 -1/2 -3 2 ]) $ Trying the Gauss-Jordan reduction $ ([ 2 -4 1 0 -1 2 0 1 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 2 -4 1 0 0 0 1/2 1 ]) $ shows that the left side won't reduce to the identity, so no inverse exists. The check $ad-bc=2· 2-(-4)· (-1)=0$ agrees. This produces an inverse. $ ([ 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 2 4 0 1 0 -1 1 0 0 0 1 ]) for step $ρ_1+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 2 4 0 1 0 0 2 3 1 0 1 ]) $ for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 2 4 0 1 0 0 0 -1 1 -1 1 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 1 2 0 1/2 0 0 0 1 -1 1 -1 ]) for step $-2ρ_3+ρ_2$ ([ 1 1 0 4 -3 3 0 1 0 2 -3/2 2 0 0 1 -1 1 -1 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 2 -3/2 1 0 1 0 2 -3/2 2 0 0 1 -1 1 -1 ]) $ $ This is one way to do the reduction. $ ([ 0 1 5 1 0 0 0 -2 4 0 1 0 2 3 -2 0 0 1 ]) for step $ρ_3↔ρ_1$ ([ 2 3 -2 0 0 1 0 -2 4 0 1 0 0 1 5 1 0 0 ]) $ for step $(1/2)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 2 3 -2 0 0 1 0 -2 4 0 1 0 0 0 7 1 1/2 0 ]) for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ ([ 1 3/2 -1 0 0 1/2 0 1 -2 0 -1/2 0 0 0 1 1/7 1/14 0 ]) for step $2ρ_3+ρ_2$ ([ 1 3/2 0 1/7 1/14 1/2 0 1 0 2/7 -5/14 0 0 0 1 1/7 1/14 0 ]) for step $-(3/2)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 -2/7 17/28 1/2 0 1 0 2/7 -5/14 0 0 0 1 1/7 1/14 0 ]) $ $ There is no inverse. $ ([ 2 2 3 1 0 0 1 -2 -3 0 1 0 4 -2 -3 0 0 1 ]) for step $-(1/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 2 2 3 1 0 0 0 -3 -9/2 -1/2 1 0 0 -6 -9 -2 0 1 ]) for step $-2ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 2 2 3 1 0 0 0 -3 -9/2 -1/2 1 0 0 0 0 -1 -2 1 ]) $ As a check, note that the third column of the starting matrix is $3/2$ times the second, and so it is indeed singular and therefore has no inverse.    What matrix has this one for its inverse? $ ([ 1 3 2 5 ]) $  We can use . $ (1/1· 5-2· 3)· ([ 5 -3 -2 1 ]) =([ -5 3 2 -1 ]) $   How does the inverse operation interact with scalar multiplication and addition of matrices?  What is the inverse of $ rH $? Is $ (H+G)^{-1}=H^{-1}+G^{-1} $?    The proof that the inverse is $ r^{-1}H^{-1}=(1/r)· H^{-1} $ (provided, of course, that the matrix is invertible) is easy. No. For one thing, the fact that $H+G$ has an inverse doesn't imply that $H$ has an inverse or that $G$ has an inverse. Neither of these matrices is invertible but their sum is. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 ])  ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) $ Another point is that just because $H$ and $G$ each has an inverse doesn't mean $H+G$ has an inverse; here is an example. $ ([ 1 0 0 1 ])  ([ -1 0 0 -1 ]) $ Still a third point is that, even if the two matrices have inverses, and the sum has an inverse, doesn't imply that the equation holds: $ ([ 2 0 0 2 ])^{-1} =([ 1/2 0 0 1/2 ])^{-1}  ([ 3 0 0 3 ])^{-1} =([ 1/3 0 0 1/3 ])^{-1} $ but $ ([ 5 0 0 5 ])^{-1} =([ 1/5 0 0 1/5 ])^{-1} $ and $(1/2)_+(1/3)$ does not equal $1/5$.    Is $ (T^k)^{-1}=(T^{-1})^k $?  Yes: $ T^k(T^{-1})^k=(TT·s T)· (T^{-1}T^{-1}·s T^{-1}) =T^{k-1}(TT^{-1})(T^{-1})^{k-1}=...=I $.   Is $ H^{-1} $ invertible?  Yes, the inverse of $ H^{-1} $ is $ H $.   For each real number $ θ $ let $ t_θ: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ be represented with respect to the standard bases by this matrix. $ ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) sin(θ) cos(θ) ]) $ Show that $ t_{θ_1+θ_2}=t_{θ_1}· t_{θ_2} $. Show also that $ {t_{θ}}^{-1}=t_{-θ} $.  One way to check that the first is true is with the angle sum formulas from trigonometry. $ ([ cos(θ_1+θ_2) -sin(θ_1+θ_2) sin(θ_1+θ_2) cos(θ_1+θ_2) ]) $ =([ cos(θ_1)cos(θ_2-)sin(θ_1)sin(θ_2) -sin(θ_1)cos(θ_2-)cos(θ_1)sin(θ_2) sin(θ_1)cos(θ_2+)cos(θ_1)sin(θ_2) cos(θ_1)cos(θ_2-)sin(θ_1)sin(θ_2) ]) =([ cos(θ_1) -sin(θ_1) sin(θ_1) cos(θ_1) ]) ([ cos(θ_2) -sin(θ_2) sin(θ_2) cos(θ_2) ]) $ $ Checking the second equation in this way is similar.  Of course, the equations can be not just checked but also understood by recalling that $t_θ$ is the map that rotates vectors about the origin through an angle of $ θ $~radians.   Do the calculations for the proof of .  There are two cases. For the first case we assume that $ a $ is nonzero. Then $ for step $-(c/a)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ a b 1 0 0 -(bc/a)+d -c/a 1 ]) =([ a b 1 0 0 (ad-bc)/a -c/a 1 ]) $ shows that the matrix is invertible (in this $ a ≠ 0 $ case) if and only if $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $. To find the inverse, we finish with the Jordan half of the reduction. $ for step $(1/a)ρ_1$ ([ 1 b/a 1/a 0 0 1 -c/(ad-bc) a/(ad-bc) ]) for step $-(b/a)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 d/(ad-bc) -b/(ad-bc) 0 1 -c/(ad-bc) a/(ad-bc) ]) $  The other case is the $ a=0 $ case. We swap to get $c$ into the $1,1$ position. $ for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ ([ c d 0 1 0 b 1 0 ]) $ This matrix is nonsingular if and only if both $ b $ and $ c $ are nonzero (which, under the case assumption that $ a=0 $, holds if and only if $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $). To find the inverse we do the Jordan half. $ for step $(1/c)ρ_1$ ([ 1 d/c 0 1/c 0 1 1/b 0 ]) for step $-(d/c)ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 -d/bc 1/c 0 1 1/b 0 ]) $ (Note that this is what is required, since $ a=0 $ gives that $ ad-bc=-bc $).   Show that this matrix $ H=([ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]) $ has infinitely many right inverses. Show also that it has no left inverse.  With $H$ a $N by M$ matrix, in looking for a matrix $G$ such that the combination $HG$ acts as the $N by N$ identity we need $G$ to be $N by M$. Setting up the equation $ ([ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]) ([ m n p q r s ]) = ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ and solving the resulting linear system $ $ m +r = 1 n +s = 0 p = 0 q = 1 $ $ gives infinitely many solutions. $ {[m n p q r s] =[1 0 0 1 0 0] +r· [-1 0 0 0 1 0] +s· [0 -1 0 0 0 1] such that r,s in ℝ} $ Thus $H$ has infinitely many right inverses.  As for left inverses, the equation $ ([ a b c d ]) ([ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]) =([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $ gives rise to a linear system with nine equations and four unknowns. $ $ a = 1 b = 0 a = 0 c = 0 d = 1 c = 0 e = 0 f = 0 e = 1 $ $ This system is inconsistent (the first equation conflicts with the third, as do the seventh and ninth) and so there is no left inverse.   In the review of inverses example, starting this subsection, how many left inverses has $ ι $?  With respect to the standard bases we have $ Representation of (ι) =([ 1 0 0 1 0 0 ]) $ and setting up the equation to find the matrix inverse $ ([ a b c d e f ]) ([ 1 0 0 1 0 0 ]) =([ 1 0 0 1 ]) =Representation of (I) $ gives rise to a linear system. $ $ a = 1 b = 0 d = 0 e = 1 $ $ There are infinitely many solutions in $a,...,f$ to this system because two of these variables are entirely unrestricted $ {[a b c d e f] =[1 0 0 0 1 0] +c· [0 0 1 0 0 0] +f· [0 0 0 0 0 1] such that c,f in ℝ} $ and so there are infinitely many solutions to the matrix equation. $ {([ 1 0 c 0 1 f ]) such that c,f in ℝ} $ With the bases still fixed at $stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)$, for instance taking $c=2$ and $f=3$ gives a matrix representing this map. $ [x y z] mapsunder{f_{2,3}} [x+2z y+3z] $ The check that $∘{f_{2,3}}{ι}$ is the identity map on $ ℝ^2$ is easy.   If a matrix has infinitely many right-inverses, can it have infinitely many left-inverses? Must it have?  By it cannot have infinitely many left inverses, because a matrix with both left and right inverses has only one of each (and that one of each is one of both- the left and right inverse matrices are equal).  Assume that $g: V → W$ is linear. One of these is true, the other is false. Which is which?  If $f: W → V$ is a left inverse of $g$ then $f$ must be linear. If $f: W → V$ is a right inverse of $g$ then $f$ must be linear.    True, It must be linear, as the proof from Theorem~II. shows. False. It may be linear, but it need not be. Consider the projection map $π: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2$ described at the start of this subsection. Define $η: ℝ^2 → ℝ^3$ in this way. $ [x y]↦[x y 1] $ It is a right inverse of $π$ because $∘{π}{η}$ does this. $ [x y]↦[x y 1]↦[x y] $ It is not linear because it does not map the zero vector to the zero vector.    Assume that $ H $ is invertible and that $ HG $ is the zero matrix. Show that $ G $ is a zero matrix.  The associativity of matrix multiplication gives $ H^{-1}(HG)=H^{-1}Z=Z $ and also $ H^{-1}(HG)=(H^{-1}H)G=IG=G $.   Prove that if $ H $ is invertible then the inverse commutes with a matrix $ GH^{-1}=H^{-1}G $ if and only if $H$ itself commutes with that matrix $ GH=HG $.  Multiply both sides of the first equation by $H$.   Show that if $ T $ is square and if $ T^4 $ is the zero matrix then $ (I-T)^{-1}=I+T+T^2+T^3 $. Generalize.  Checking that when $I-T$ is multiplied on both sides by that expression (assuming that $T^4$ is the zero matrix) then the result is the identity matrix is easy. The obvious generalization is that if $ T^n $ is the zero matrix then $ (I-T)^{-1}=I+T+T^2+·s+T^{n-1} $; the check again is easy.   Let $ D $ be diagonal. Describe $ D^2 $, $ D^3 $, ...thinspace, etc. Describe $ D^{-1} $, $ D^{-2} $, ...thinspace, etc. Define $ D^0 $ appropriately.  The powers of the matrix are formed by taking the powers of the diagonal entries. That is, $ D^2 $ is all zeros except for diagonal entries of $ {d_{1,1}}^2 $, $ {d_{2,2}}^2 $, etc. This suggests defining $ D^0 $ to be the identity matrix.   Prove that any matrix row-equivalent to an invertible matrix is also invertible.  Assume that $B$ is row equivalent to $A$ and that $A$ is invertible. Because they are row-equivalent, there is a sequence of row steps to reduce one to the other. We can do that reduction with matrices, for instance, $A$ can change by row operations to $B$ as $B=R_n·s R_1A$. This equation gives $B$ as a product of invertible matrices and by then, $B$ is also invertible.   textit{The first question below appeared as .}  Show that the rank of the product of two matrices is less than or equal to the minimum of the rank of each. Show that if $ T $ and $ S $ are square then $ TS=I $ if and only if $ ST=I $.    See the answer to . We will show that both conditions are equivalent to the condition that the two matrices be nonsingular.  As $ T $ and $ S $ are square and their product is defined, they are equal-sized, say $ N by N $. Consider the $ TS=I $ half. By the prior item the rank of $ I $ is less than or equal to the minimum of the rank of $ T $ and the rank of $ S $. But the rank of $ I $ is $ n $, so the rank of $ T $ and the rank of $ S $ must each be $ n $. Hence each is nonsingular.  The same argument shows that $ ST=I $ implies that each is nonsingular.    Show that the inverse of a permutation matrix is its transpose.  Inverses are unique, so we need only show that it works. The check appears above as .   textit{The first two parts of this question appeared as .}  Show that $ (GH)ᵀ=HᵀGᵀ $. A square matrix is {m symmetric} if each $ i,j $ entry equals the $ j,i $ entry (that is, if the matrix equals its transpose). Show that the matrices $ HHᵀ $ and $ HᵀH $ are symmetric. Show that the inverse of the transpose is the transpose of the inverse. Show that the inverse of a symmetric matrix is symmetric.    See the answer for . See the answer for . Apply the first part to $ I=AA^{-1} $ to get $I=Iᵀ=trans{(AA^{-1})}=trans{(A^{-1})}Aᵀ$. Apply the prior item with $ Aᵀ=A $, as $ A $ is symmetric.    textit{The items starting this question appeared as .}  Prove that the composition of the projections $ π_x,π_y: ℝ^3 → ℝ^3 $ is the zero map despite that neither is the zero map. Prove that the composition of the derivatives $ d^2/dx^2,d^3/dx^3: polyspace(_4) → polyspace(_4) $ is the zero map despite that neither map is the zero map. Give matrix equations representing each of the prior two items.  When two things multiply to give zero despite that neither is zero, each is said to be a zero divisor. Prove that no zero divisor is invertible.  For the answer to the items making up the first half, see . For the proof in the second half, assume that $A$ is a zero divisor so there is a nonzero matrix $B$ with $AB=Z$ (or else $BA=Z$; this case is similar), If $A$ is invertible then $A^{-1}(AB)=(A^{-1}A)B=IB=B$ but also $A^{-1}(AB)=A^{-1}Z=Z$, contradicting that $B$ is nonzero.   In real number algebra, there are exactly two numbers, $1$ and $-1$, that are their own multiplicative inverse. Does $ H^2=I $ have exactly two solutions for $ N by N $ matrices?  Here are four solutions to $ H^2=I $. $ ([ ± 1 0 0 ± 1 ]) $   Is the relation `is a two-sided inverse of' transitive? Reflexive? Symmetric?  It is not reflexive since, for instance, $ H=([ 1 0 0 2 ]) $ is not a two-sided inverse of itself. The same example shows that it is not transitive. That matrix has this two-sided inverse $ G=([ 1 0 0 1/2 ]) $ and while $ H $ is a two-sided inverse of $ G $ and $ G $ is a two-sided inverse of $ H $, we know that $ H $ is not a two-sided inverse of $ H $. However, the relation is symmetric:~if $ G $ is a two-sided inverse of $ H $ then $ GH=I=HG $ and therefore $ H $ is also a two-sided inverse of $ G $.    Prove: if the sum of the elements of each row of a square matrix is $ k $, then the sum of the elements in each row of the inverse matrix is $ 1/k $.   Let $ A $ be $ N by m $, non-singular, with the stated property. Let $ B $ be its inverse. Then for $ n≤ m $, $ 1 =∑_{r=1}^{m}δ_{nr} =∑_{r=1}^{m}∑_{s=1}^{m}b_{ns}a_{sr} =∑_{s=1}^{m}∑_{r=1}^{m}b_{ns}a_{sr} =k∑_{s=1}^{m}b_{ns} $ ($ A $ is singular if $ k=0 $).                 Representations vary with the bases. For instance, with respect to the bases $stdbasis(_2)$ and $ B=[1 1],[1 -1] $ $vec(e)_1 in ℝ^2$ has these different representations. $ rep{vec(e)_1}{stdbasis(_2)}=[1 0]  rep{vec(e)_1}{B}=[1/2 1/2] $ The same holds for maps: with respect to the basis pairs $stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)$ and $stdbasis(_2),B$, the identity map has these representations. $ Representation of (id)= ([ 1 0 0 1 ])  Representation of (id)= ([ 1/2 1/2 1/2 -1/2 ]) $ This section shows how to translate among the representations. That is, we will compute how the representations vary as the bases vary.              In converting $rep{vec(v)}{B}$ to $rep{vec(v)}{D}$ the underlying vector $vec(v)$ doesn't change. Thus, the translation between these two ways of expressing the vector is accomplished by the identity map on the space, described so that the domain space vectors are represented with respect to $B$ and the codomain space vectors are represented with respect to $D$.   $  V_{wrt(B)} @V{$I$} VV V_{wrt(D)}  $ (This diagram is vertical to fit with the ones in the next subsection.)     The change of basis matrix  for bases $ B,D⊆ V $ is the representation of the identity map $ I: V → V $ with respect to those bases. $ Representation of (I)= ([ ... ... rep{vec(β)_1}{D} ·s rep{vec(β)_n}{D} ... ... ]) $      A better name would be `change of representation matrix' but the above name is standard.   The next result supports the definition.    Left-multiplication by the change of basis matrix for $ B,D $ converts a representation with respect to $ B $ to one with respect to $ D $. Conversely, if left-multiplication by a matrix changes bases $M·rep{vec(v)}{B}=rep{vec(v)}{D}$ then $M$ is a change of basis matrix.      The first sentence holds because matrix-vector multiplication represents a map application and so $ Representation of (I)·rep{vec(v)}{B}=rep{I(vec(v))}{D} =rep{vec(v)}{D} $ for each $ vec(v) $. For the second sentence, with respect to $B,D$ the matrix $M$ represents a linear map whose action is to map each vector to itself, and is therefore the identity map.    For example With these bases for $ ℝ^2 $, $ B= sequence{ [2 1], [1 0] }  D= sequence{ [-1 1], [1 1] } $ because $ Representation of (I([2 1])) =[-1/2 3/2]_D  Representation of (I([1 0])) =[-1/2 1/2]_D $ the change of basis matrix is this. $ Representation of (id) = ([ -1/2 -1/2 3/2 1/2 ]) $ For instance, this is the representation of $vec(e)_2$ $ Representation of ([0 1] ) =[1 -2]    $ and the matrix does the conversion. $ ([ -1/2 -1/2 3/2 1/2 ]) [1 -2] = [1/2 1/2] $ Checking that vector on the right is $rep{vec(e)_2 }{D}$ is easy.   We finish this subsection by recognizing the change of basis matrices as a familiar set.    A matrix changes bases if and only if it is nonsingular.      For the `only if' direction, if left-multiplication by a matrix changes bases then the matrix represents an invertible function, simply because we can invert the function by changing the bases back. Because it represents a function that is invertible, the matrix itself is invertible, and so is nonsingular.    For `if' we will show that any nonsingular matrix $M$ performs a change of basis operation from any given starting basis $B$ (having~$n$ vectors, where the matrix is $N by N$) to some ending basis.    If the matrix is the identity~$I$ then the statement is obvious. Otherwise because the matrix is nonsingular Corollary~IV. says there are elementary reduction matrices such that $R_r·s R_1· M=I$ with $r≥ 1$. Elementary matrices are invertible and their inverses are also elementary so multiplying both sides of that equation from the left by ${R_r}^{-1}$, then by ${R_{r-1}}^{-1}$, etc., gives $M$ as a product of elementary matrices $M={R_1}^{-1}·s {R_r}^{-1}$.      We will be done if we show that elementary matrices change a given basis to another basis, since then ${R_r}^{-1}$ changes $B$ to some other basis $B_r$ and ${R_{r-1}}^{-1}$ changes $B_r$ to some $B_{r-1}$, etc. We will cover the three types of elementary matrices separately; recall the notation for the three.   $ M_{i}(k) colvec{ c_1 ... c_i ... c_n } = colvec{ c_1 ... kc_i ... c_n }  P_{i,j} colvec{ c_1 ... c_i ... c_j ... c_n } = colvec{ c_1 ... c_j ... c_i ... c_n }  C_{i,j}(k) colvec{ c_1 ... c_i ... c_j ... c_n } = colvec{ c_1 ... c_i ... kc_i+c_j ... c_n } $  Applying a row-multiplication matrix~$M_{i}(k)$ changes a representation with respect to $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_i,...,vec(β)_n } $ to one with respect to $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,(1/k)vec(β)_i,...,vec(β)_n } $. $ vec(v)= c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_i·vec(β)_i +...+c_n·vec(β)_n ↦ c_1·vec(β)_1+...+kc_i·(1/k)vec(β)_i+... +c_n·vec(β)_n=vec(v) $ The second one is a basis because the first is a basis and because of the $k ≠ 0$ restriction in the definition of a row-multiplication matrix.   Similarly, left-multiplication by a row-swap matrix $P_{i,j}$ changes a representation with respect to the basis $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_i,...,vec(β)_j, ...,vec(β)_n } $ into one with respect to this basis $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_j,...,vec(β)_i, ...,vec(β)_n } $. $ vec(v)= c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_i·vec(β)_i +...+c_jvec(β)_j+...+c_n·vec(β)_n ↦ c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_j·vec(β)_j+... +c_i·vec(β)_i+...+c_n·vec(β)_n=vec(v) $   And, a representation with respect to $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_i,...,vec(β)_j, ...,vec(β)_n } $ changes via left-multiplication by a row-combination matrix $C_{i,j}(k)$ into a representation with respect to $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_i-kvec(β)_j, ...,vec(β)_j,...,vec(β)_n } $ $ vec(v)= c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_i·vec(β)_i +c_jvec(β)_j+...+c_n·vec(β)_n ↦ c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_i·(vec(β)_i-kvec(β)_j)+... +(kc_i+c_j)·vec(β)_j+...+c_n·vec(β)_n=vec(v) $ (the definition of $C_{i,j}(k)$ specifies that $ i ≠ j $ and $ k ≠ 0 $).      A matrix is nonsingular if and only if it represents the identity map with respect to some pair of bases.                In $ ℝ^2 $, where $ D=[2 1],[-2 4] $ find the change of basis matrices from $ D $ to $ stdbasis(_2) $ and from $ stdbasis(_2) $ to $ D $. Multiply the two.  For the matrix to change bases from $D$ to $stdbasis(_2)$ we need that $rep{I(vec(δ)_1)}{stdbasis(_2)} =rep{vec(δ)_1}{stdbasis(_2)}$ and that $rep{I(vec(δ)_2)}{stdbasis(_2)} =rep{vec(δ)_2}{stdbasis(_2)}$. Of course, the representation of a vector in $ ℝ^2$ with respect to the standard basis is easy. $ rep{vec(δ)_1}{stdbasis(_2)}=[2 1]  rep{vec(δ)_2}{stdbasis(_2)}=[-2 4] $ Concatenating those two together to make the columns of the change of basis matrix gives this. $ Representation of (I) =([ 2 -2 1 4 ]) $ For the change of basis matrix in the other direction we can calculate $rep{I(vec(e)_1)}{D}=rep{vec(e)_1}{D}$ and $rep{I(vec(e)_2)}{D}=rep{vec(e)_2}{D}$ (this job is routine) or we can take the inverse of the above matrix. Because of the formula for the inverse of a $N by N$ matrix, this is easy. $ Representation of (I)= (1/10)·([ 4 2 -1 2 ]) =([ 4/10 2/10 -1/10 2/10 ]) $   Find the change of basis matrix for $ B,D⊆ ℝ^2 $.  $ B=stdbasis(_2) $, $ D=sequence{vec(e)_2,vec(e)_1} $ $ B=stdbasis(_2) $, $ D=[1 2],[1 4] $ $ B=[1 2],[1 4] $, $ D=stdbasis(_2) $ $ B=[-1 1],[2 2] $, $ D=[0 4],[1 3] $   Concatenate $rep{I(vec(β)_1)}{D}=rep{vec(β)_1}{D}$ and $rep{I(vec(β)_2)}{D}=rep{vec(β)_2}{D}$ to make the change of basis matrix $Representation of (I)$.  $ ([ 0 1 1 0 ]) $ $ ([ 2 -1/2 -1 1/2 ]) $ $ ([ 1 1 2 4 ]) $ $ ([ 1 -1 -1 2 ]) $    Find the change of basis matrix for each $ B,D⊆polyspace(_2) $.  $ B=1,x,x^2, D=x^2,1,x $ $ B=1,x,x^2, D=1,1+x,1+x+x^2 $ $ B=2,2x,x^2, D=1+x^2,1-x^2,x+x^2 $   The vectors $rep{I(vec(β)_1)}{D}=rep{vec(β)_1}{D}$, $rep{I(vec(β)_2)}{D}=rep{vec(β)_2}{D}$, and $rep{I(vec(β)_3)}{D}=rep{vec(β)_3}{D}$ make the change of basis matrix $Representation of (I)$.  $ ([ 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $ $ ([ 1 -1 0 0 1 -1 0 0 1 ]) $ $ ([ 1 -1 1/2 1 1 -1/2 0 2 0 ]) $  E.g., for the first column of the first matrix, $1=0· x^2+1· 1+0· x$.   For the bases in , find the change of basis matrix in the other direction, from $D$ to $B$.  One way to go is to find $rep{vec(δ)_1}{B}$ and $rep{vec(δ)_2}{B}$, and then concatenate them into the columns of the desired change of basis matrix. Another way is to find the inverse of the matrices that answer .   $([ 0 1 1 0 ])$ $ ([ 1 1 2 4 ]) $ $ ([ 2 -1/2 -1 1/2 ]) $ $ ([ 2 1 1 1 ]) $    Decide if each changes bases on $ ℝ^2 $. To what basis is $ stdbasis(_2) $ changed?  $ ([ 5 0 0 4 ]) $ $ ([ 2 1 3 1 ]) $ $ ([ -1 4 2 -8 ]) $ $ ([ 1 -1 1 1 ]) $   A matrix changes bases if and only if it is nonsingular.  This matrix is nonsingular and so changes bases. Finding to what basis $ stdbasis(_2) $ is changed means finding $D$ such that $ Representation of (I)= ([ 5 0 0 4 ]) $ and by the definition of how a matrix represents a linear map, we have this. $ rep{I(vec(e)_1)}{D}=rep{vec(e)_1}{D}=[5 0]  rep{I(vec(e)_2)}{D}=rep{vec(e)_2}{D}=[0 4] $ Where $ D=[x_1 y_1],[x_2 y_2] $ we can either solve the system $ [1 0] =5[x_1 y_1]+0[x_2 y_1]  [0 1] =0[x_1 y_1]+4[x_2 y_1] $ or else just spot the answer (thinking of the proof of ). $ D=sequence{[1/5 0], [0 1/4]} $ Yes, this matrix is nonsingular and so changes bases. To calculate $D$, we proceed as above with $ D=sequence{[x_1 y_1], [x_2 y_2]} $ to solve $ [1 0] =2[x_1 y_1]+3[x_2 y_1] and [0 1] =1[x_1 y_1]+1[x_2 y_1] $ and get this. $ D=sequence{[-1 3], [1 -2]} $ No, this matrix does not change bases because it is singular. Yes, this matrix changes bases because it is nonsingular. The calculation of the changed-to basis is as above. $ D=sequence{[1/2 -1/2], [1/2 1/2]} $   For each space find the matrix changing a vector representation with respect to $B$ to one with respect to~$D$.  $V= ℝ^3$, $B=stdbasis(_3)$, $D=sequence{[1 2 3], [1 1 1], [0 1 -1]}$ $V= ℝ^3$, $B=sequence{[1 2 3], [1 1 1], [0 1 -1]}$, $D=stdbasis(_3)$ $V=polyspace(_2)$, $B=x^2, x^2+x, x^2+x+1$, $D=2, -x, x^2$     Start by computing the effect of the identity function on each element of the starting basis~$B$. Obviously this is the effect. $ [1 0 0]I ↓[1 0 0]  [0 1 0]I ↓[0 1 0]  [0 0 1]I ↓[0 0 1] $ Now represent the three outputs with respect to the ending basis. $ Representation of ([1 0 0])=[-2/3 5/3 -1/3]  Representation of ([0 1 0])=[1/3 -1/3 2/3]  Representation of ([0 0 1])=[1/3 -1/3 -1/3] $ Concatenate them into a basis. $ Representation of (I)= ([ -2/3 1/3 1/3 5/3 -1/3 -1/3 -1/3 2/3 -1/3 ]) $  One way to find this is to take the inverse of the prior matrix, since it converts bases in the other direction. Alternatively, we can compute these three $ Representation of ([1 2 3]) =[1 2 3]  Representation of ([1 1 1]) =[1 1 1]  Representation of ([0 1 -1]) =[0 1 -1] $ and put them in a matrix. $ Representation of (I)= ([ 1 1 0 2 1 1 3 1 -1 ]) $  Representing $I(x^2)$, $I(x^2+x)$, and~$I(x^2+x+1)$ with respect to the ending basis gives this. $ Representation of (x^2)=[0 0 1]  Representation of (x^2+x)=[0 -1 1]  Representation of (x^2+x+1)=[1/2 -1 1] $ Put them together. $ Representation of (I)= ([ 0 0 1/2 0 -1 -1 1 1 1 ]) $    Find bases such that this matrix represents the identity map with respect to those bases. $ ([ 3 1 4 2 -1 1 0 0 4 ]) $  This question has many different solutions. One way to proceed is to make up any basis $B$ for any space, and then compute the appropriate $D$ (necessarily for the same space, of course). Another, easier, way to proceed is to fix the codomain as $ ℝ^3$ and the codomain basis as $stdbasis(_3)$. This way (recall that the representation of any vector with respect to the standard basis is just the vector itself), we have this. $ B=sequence{[3 2 0], [1 -1 0], [4 1 4] }  D=stdbasis(_3) $   Consider the vector space of real-valued functions with basis $ sin(x),cos(x) $. Show that $ 2sin(x)+cos(x),3cos(x) $ is also a basis for this space. Find the change of basis matrix in each direction.  Checking that $ B=2sin(x)+cos(x),3cos(x) $ is a basis is routine. Call the natural basis $D$. To compute the change of basis matrix $Representation of (I)$ we must find $Representation of (2sin(x)+cos(x))$ and $Representation of (3cos(x))$, that is, we need $x_1,y_1, x_2,y_2$ such that these equations hold. $ x_1· sin(x)+y_1·cos(x) = 2sin(x)+cos(x) x_2· sin(x)+y_2·cos(x) = 3cos(x) $ Obviously this is the answer. $ Representation of (I) =([ 2 0 1 3 ]) $ For the change of basis matrix in the other direction we could look for $Representation of (sin(x))$ and $Representation of (cos(x))$ by solving these. $ w_1· (2sin(x)+cos(x))+z_1·(3cos(x)) = sin(x) w_2· (2sin(x)+cos(x))+z_2·(3cos(x)) = cos(x) $ An easier method is to find the inverse of the matrix found above. $ Representation of (I) =([ 2 0 1 3 ])^{-1} =(1/6)·([ 3 0 -1 2 ]) =([ 1/2 0 -1/6 1/3 ]) $   Where does this matrix $ ([ cos(2θ) sin(2θ) sin(2θ) -cos(2θ) ]) $ send the standard basis for $ ℝ^2 $? Any other bases? Hint. Consider the inverse.  We start by taking the inverse of the matrix, that is, by deciding what is the inverse to the map of interest. $ Representation of (I) Representation of (I)^{-1} =(1/-cos(2θ)-sin(2θ))·([ -cos(2θ) -sin(2θ) -sin(2θ) cos(2θ) ]) =([ cos(2θ) sin(2θ) sin(2θ) -cos(2θ) ]) $ This is more tractable than the representation the other way because this matrix is the concatenation of these two column vectors $ rep{vec(δ)_1}{stdbasis(_2)} =[ cos(2θ) sin(2θ)]  rep{vec(δ)_2}{stdbasis(_2)} =[ sin(2θ) - cos(2θ)] $ and representations with respect to $stdbasis(_2)$ are transparent. $ vec(δ)_1=[ cos(2θ) sin(2θ)]  vec(δ)_2=[ sin(2θ) - cos(2θ)] $ This pictures the action of the map that transforms $D$ to $stdbasis(_2)$ (it is, again, the inverse of the map that is the answer to this question). The line lies at an angle $θ$ to the $x$~axis.    This map reflects vectors over that line. Since reflections are self-inverse, the answer to the question is:~the original map reflects about the line through the origin with angle of elevation $θ$. (Of course, it does this to any basis.)   What is the change of basis matrix with respect to $ B,B $?  The appropriately-sized identity matrix.   Prove that a matrix changes bases if and only if it is invertible.  Each is true if and only if the matrix is nonsingular.   Finish the proof of .  What remains is to show that left multiplication by a reduction matrix represents a change from another basis to $ B=basis(β){n} $.  Application of a row-multiplication matrix $ M_i(k) $ translates a representation with respect to the basis $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,kvec(β)_i,...,vec(β)_n} $ to one with respect to $ B $, as here. $ vec(v)=c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_i·(kvec(β)_i) +...+c_n·vec(β)_n ↦ c_1·vec(β)_1+... +(kc_i)·vec(β)_i+...+c_n·vec(β)_n=vec(v) $ Apply a row-swap matrix $ P_{i,j} $ to translates a representation with respect to the basis $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_j,..., vec(β)_i,...,vec(β)_n} $ to one with respect to $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_i,..., vec(β)_j,...,vec(β)_n} $. Finally, applying a row-combination matrix $ C_{i,j}(k) $ changes a representation with respect to $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_i+kvec(β)_j,..., vec(β)_j,...,vec(β)_n} $ to one with respect to $ B $. $ vec(v)= c_1·vec(β)_1+... +c_i·(vec(β)_i+kvec(β)_j) +...+c_jvec(β)_j+...+c_n·vec(β)_n ↦ c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_i·vec(β)_i +...+(kc_i+c_j)·vec(β)_j +...+c_n·vec(β)_n=vec(v) $ (As in the part of the proof in the body of this subsection, the various conditions on the row operations, e.g., that the scalar $k$ is nonzero, assure that these are all bases.)   Let $ H $ be an $ N by N $ nonsingular matrix. What basis of $ ℝ^n $ does $ H $ change to the standard basis?  Taking $H$ as a change of basis matrix $H=Representation of (I)$, its columns are $ [h_{1,i] ... h_{n,i}} =rep{I(vec(β)_i)}{stdbasis(_n)} =rep{vec(β)_i}{stdbasis(_n)} $ and, because representations with respect to the standard basis are transparent, we have this. $ [h_{1,i] ... h_{n,i}} =vec(β)_i $ That is, the basis is the one composed of the columns of $ H $.    In $ polyspace(_3) $ with basis $ B=1+x,1-x,x^2+x^3,x^2-x^3 $ we have this representation. $ Representation of (1-x+3x^2-x^3)= [0 1 1 2]_B $ Find a basis $ D $ giving this different representation for the same polynomial. $ Representation of (1-x+3x^2-x^3)= [1 0 2 0]_D $ State and prove that we can change any nonzero vector representation to any other.  Hint. The proof of is constructive- it not only says the bases change, it shows how they change.   We can change the starting vector representation to the ending one through a sequence of row operations. The proof tells us what how the bases change. We start by swapping the first and second rows of the representation with respect to $B$ to get a representation with respect to a new basis $B_1$. $ Representation of (1-x+3x^2-x^3)= [1 0 1 2]_{B_1}  B_1=1-x,1+x,x^2+x^3,x^2-x^3 $ We next add $ -2 $ times the third row of the vector representation to the fourth row. $ Representation of (1-x+3x^2-x^3)= [1 0 1 0]_{B_2}  B_2=1-x,1+x,3x^2-x^3,x^2-x^3 $ (The third element of $ B_2 $ is the third element of $ B_1 $ minus $ -2 $ times the fourth element of $B_1$.) Now we can finish by doubling the third row. $ Representation of (1-x+3x^2-x^3)= [1 0 2 0]_{D}  D=1-x,1+x,(3x^2-x^3)/2,x^2-x^3 $  Here are three different approaches to stating such a result. The first is the assertion:~where $V$ is a vector space with basis $B$ and $vec(v) in V$ is nonzero, for any nonzero column vector $vec(z)$ (whose number of components equals the dimension of $V$) there is a change of basis matrix $M$ such that $M· rep{vec(v)}{B}=vec(z)$. The second possible statement:~for any ($n$-dimensional) vector space $V$ and any nonzero vector $ vec(v) in V $, where $ vec(z)_1, vec(z)_2 in ℝ^n $ are nonzero, there are bases $ B, D⊆ V $ such that $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=vec(z)_1 $ and $ rep{vec(v)}{D}=vec(z)_2 $. The third is:~for any nonzero $vec(v)$ member of any vector space (of dimension~$n$) and any nonzero column vector (with $n$ components) there is a basis such that $vec(v)$ is represented with respect to that basis by that column vector.  The first and second statements follow easily from the third. The first follows because the third statement gives a basis $D$ such that $rep{vec(v)}{D}=vec(z)$ and then $Representation of (I)$ is the desired~$M$. The second follows from the third because it is just a doubled application of it.  A way to prove the third is as in the answer to the first part of this question. Here is a sketch. Represent $vec(v)$ with respect to any basis $B$ with a column vector $vec(z)_1$. This column vector must have a nonzero component because $vec(v)$ is a nonzero vector. Use that component in a sequence of row operations to convert $vec(z)_1$ to $vec(z)$. (We could fill out this sketch as an induction argument on the dimension of $V$.)    Let $ V,W $ be vector spaces, and let $ B,B̂ $ be bases for $ V $ and $ D,D̂ $ be bases for $ W $. Where $ h: V → W $ is linear, find a formula relating $ Representation of (h) $ to $ h{B̂,D̂} $.  This is the topic of the next subsection.   Show that the columns of an $ N by N $ change of basis matrix form a basis for $ ℝ^n $. Do all bases appear in that way:~can the vectors from any $ ℝ^n$ basis make the columns of a change of basis matrix?  A change of basis matrix is nonsingular and thus has rank equal to the number of its columns. Therefore its set of columns is a linearly independent subset of size $n$ in $ ℝ^n$ and it is thus a basis. The answer to the second half is also `yes'; all implications in the prior sentence reverse (that is, all of the `if ... then~...' parts of the prior sentence convert to `if and only if' parts).   Find a matrix having this effect. $ [1 3] ↦ [4 -1] $ That is, find a $M$ that left-multiplies the starting vector to yield the ending vector. Is there a matrix having these two effects?   $ [1 3]↦[1 1]  [2 -1]↦[-1 -1] $ $ [1 3]↦[1 1]  [2 6]↦[-1 -1] $  Give a necessary and sufficient condition for there to be a matrix such that $vec(v)_1↦vec(w)_1$ and $vec(v)_2↦vec(w)_2$.  In response to the first half of the question, there are infinitely many such matrices. One of them represents with respect to $ stdbasis(_2) $ the transformation of $ ℝ^2 $ with this action. $ [1 0]↦[4 0]  [0 1]↦[0 -1/3] $ The problem of specifying two distinct input/output pairs is a bit trickier. The fact that matrices have a linear action precludes some possibilities.  Yes, there is such a matrix. These conditions $ ([ a b c d ]) [1 3] = [1 1]  ([ a b c d ]) [2 -1] = [-1 -1] $ can be solved $ $ a + 3b = 1 c + 3d = 1 2a - b = -1 2c - d = -1 $ $ to give this matrix. $ ([ -2/7 3/7 -2/7 3/7 ]) $ No, because $ 2·[1 3]=[2 6] but 2·[1 1] ≠[-1 -1] $ no linear action can produce this effect. A sufficient condition is that $ {vec{{v}_1,vec{{v}_2} $ be linearly independent, but that's not a necessary condition. A necessary and sufficient condition is that any linear dependences among the starting vectors appear also among the ending vectors. That is, $ c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2=0 implies c_1vec(w)_1+c_2vec(w)_2=0. $ The proof of this condition is routine.                       The first subsection shows how to convert the representation of a vector with respect to one basis to the representation of that same vector with respect to another basis. We next convert the representation of a map with respect to one pair of bases to the representation with respect to a different pair- we convert from $Representation of (h)$ to $h{B̂,D̂}$. Here is the arrow diagram.  $  V_{wrt(B)} → (H) W_{wrt(D)} @V{$I$} VV @V{$I$} VV V_{wrt(B̂)} → (Ĥ) W_{wrt(D̂)}  $ To move from the lower-left to the lower-right we can either go straight over, or else up to $V_B$ then over to $W_D$ and then down. So we can calculate $Ĥ=h{B̂,D̂}$ either by directly using $B̂$ and $D̂$, or else by first changing bases with $I{B̂,B}$ then multiplying by $ H=Representation of (h) $ and then changing bases with $I{D,D̂}$. $ Ĥ= I{D,D̂}· H· I{B̂,B} tag*{($*$)}$        For example The matrix $ T=([ cos(π/6) -sin(π/6) sin(π/6) cos(π/6) ]) = ([ √{3}/2 -1/2 1/2 √{3}/2 ]) $ represents, with respect to $ stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2) $, the transformation $ t: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ that rotates vectors through the counterclockwise angle of $ π/6 $ radians.    We can translate $T$ to a representation with respect to these $ B̂=sequence{ [1 1] [0 2] }  D̂=sequence{ [-1 0] [2 3] } $ by using the arrow diagram above. $  ℝ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} → (T) ℝ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} @V$I$ VV @V$I$ VV ℝ^2_{wrt(B̂)} → (T̂) ℝ^2_{wrt(D̂)}  $ The picture illustrates that we can compute~$T̂$ either directly by going along the square's bottom, or as in formula~($*$) by going up on the left, then across the top, and then down on the right, with $T̂= I{stdbasis(_2),D̂}· T· I{B̂,stdbasis(_2)}$. (Note again that the matrix multiplication reads right to left, as the three functions are composed and function composition reads right to left.)  Find the matrix for the left-hand side, the matrix~$I{B̂,stdbasis(_2)}$, in the usual way:~find the effect of the identity matrix on the starting basis~$B̂$- which of course is no effect at all- and then represent those basis elements with respect to the ending basis~$stdbasis(_3)$. $ I{B̂,stdbasis(_2)} = ([ 1 0 1 2 ]) $ This calculation is easy when the ending basis is the standard one.  There are two ways to compute the matrix for going down the square's right side, $I{stdbasis(_2),D̂}$. We could calculate it directly as we did for the other change of basis matrix. Or, we could instead calculate it as the inverse of the matrix for going up $I{D̂,stdbasis(_2)}$. Find that matrix is easy, and we have a formula for the $N by N$ inverse so that's what is in the equation below. $ t{B̂,D̂} =([ -1 2 0 3 ])^{-1} ([ √{3}/2 -1/2 1/2 √{3}/2 ]) ([ 1 0 1 2 ]) =([ (5-√{3})/6 (3+2√{3})/3 (1+√{3})/6 √{3}/3 ]) $  The matrix is messier but the map that it represents is the same. For instance, to replicate the effect of $t$ in the picture, start with $B̂$, $ [1 3]{B̂}=[1 1]_{B̂} $ apply $T̂$, $ ([ (5-√{3})/6 (3+2√{3})/3 (1+√{3})/6 √{3}/3 ])_{B̂,D̂} [1 1]_{B̂} = [(11+3√{3])/6 (1+3√{3})/6}_{D̂} $ and check it against $D̂$. $ frac{11+3√{3}}{6}·[-1 0] +frac{1+3√{3}}{6}·[2 3] =[(-3+√{3])/2 (1+3√{3})/2} $   For example Changing bases can make the matrix simpler. On $ ℝ^3 $ the map $ [x y z]t ↓[y+z x+z x+y] $ is represented with respect to the standard basis in this way. $ Representation of (t)= ([ 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 ]) $ Representing it with respect to $ B=sequence{[1 -1 0], [1 1 -2], [1 1 1]} $ gives a matrix that is diagonal. $ Representation of (t)= ([ -1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 2 ]) $   Naturally we usually prefer representations that are easier to understand. We say that a map or matrix has been diagonalized when we find a basis~$B$ such that the representation is diagonal with respect to $B,B$, that is, with respect to the same starting basis as ending basis. Chapter Five finds which maps and matrices are diagonalizable.  The rest of this subsection develops the easier case of finding two bases $B,D$ such that a representation is simple. Recall that the prior subsection shows that a matrix is a change of basis matrix if and only if it is nonsingular.      Same-sized matrices $ H $ and $ Ĥ $ are matrix equivalent  if there are nonsingular matrices $ P $ and $ Q $ such that $Ĥ=PHQ$.      Matrix equivalent matrices represent the same map, with respect to appropriate pairs of bases.     This is immediate from equation~($*$) above.   checks that matrix equivalence is an equivalence relation. Thus it partitions the set of matrices into matrix equivalence classes.  raisebox(.5in){ All matrices: }  raisebox(.3in){ $H$ matrix equivalent to $Ĥ$ }  We can get insight into the classes by comparing matrix equivalence with row equivalence (remember that matrices are row equivalent when they can be reduced to each other by row operations). In $Ĥ=PHQ$, the matrices $P$ and $Q$ are nonsingular and thus each is a product of elementary reduction matrices by Lemma~IV.. Left-multiplication by the reduction matrices making up $P$ performs row operations. Right-multiplication by the reduction matrices making up $Q$ performs column operations. Hence, matrix equivalence is a generalization of row equivalence- two matrices are row equivalent if one can be converted to the other by a sequence of row reduction steps, while two matrices are matrix equivalent if one can be converted to the other by a sequence of row reduction steps followed by a sequence of column reduction steps.  Consequently, if matrices are row equivalent then they are also matrix equivalent since we can take $Q$ to be the identity matrix. The converse, however, does not hold: two matrices can be matrix equivalent but not row equivalent.  For example These two are matrix equivalent $ ([ 1 0 0 0 ])  ([ 1 1 0 0 ]) $ because the second reduces to the first by the column operation of taking $-1$ times the first column and adding to the second. They are not row equivalent because they have different reduced echelon forms (both are already in reduced form).   We close this section by giving a set of representatives for the matrix equivalence classes.       Any $ N by M $ matrix of rank $ k $ is matrix equivalent to the $ N by M $ matrix that is all zeros except that the first $ k $ diagonal entries are ones. $ ([ 1 0 ... 0 0 ... 0 0 1 ... 0 0 ... 0 ... 0 0 ... 1 0 ... 0 0 0 ... 0 0 ... 0 ... 0 0 ... 0 0 ... 0 ]) $     This is a block partial-identity form. $ ([ I Z Z Z ]) $     Gauss-Jordan reduce the given matrix and combine all the row reduction matrices to make $ P $. Then use the leading entries to do column reduction and finish by swapping the columns to put the leading ones on the diagonal. Combine the column reduction matrices into $ Q $.    For example We illustrate the proof by finding $P$ and $Q$ for this matrix. $ ([ 1 2 1 -1 0 0 1 -1 2 4 2 -2 ]) $ First Gauss-Jordan row-reduce. $ ([ 1 -1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 -2 0 1 ]) ([ 1 2 1 -1 0 0 1 -1 2 4 2 -2 ]) = ([ 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 -1 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Then column-reduce, which involves right-multiplication. $ ([ 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 -1 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 1 -2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Finish by swapping columns. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Finally, combine the left-multipliers together as $P$ and the right-multipliers together as $Q$ to get $PHQ$. $ ([ 1 -1 0 0 1 0 -2 0 1 ]) ([ 1 2 1 -1 0 0 1 -1 2 4 2 -2 ]) ([ 1 0 -2 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $     Matrix equivalence classes are characterized by rank: two same-sized matrices are matrix equivalent if and only if they have the same rank.      Two same-sized matrices with the same rank are equivalent to the same block partial-identity matrix.    For example The $N by N$ matrices have only three possible ranks:~zero, one, or~two. Thus there are three matrix equivalence classes.   raisebox(.5in){ All $N by N$ matrices: }  raisebox(.3in){ Three equivalence classes }  Each class consists of all of the $N by N$ matrices with the same rank. There is only one rank~zero matrix. The other two classes have infinitely many members; we've shown only the canonical representative.   One nice thing about the representative in is that we can completely understand the linear map when it is expressed in this way: where the bases are $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n} $ and $ D=sequence{vec(δ)_1,...,vec(δ)_m} $ then the map's action is $ c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_kvec(β)_k+c_{k+1}vec(β)_{k+1}+... +c_nvec(β)_n ↦ c_1vec(δ)_1+...+c_kvec(δ)_k+0+·s+0 $ where $ k $ is the rank. Thus we can view any linear map as a projection. $ [c_1 ... c_k c_{k+1] ... c_n}_B ↦ [c_1 ... c_k 0 ... 0]_D $        Decide if these matrices are matrix equivalent.  $ ([ 1 3 0 2 3 0 ]) $, $ ([ 2 2 1 0 5 -1 ]) $ $ ([ 0 3 1 1 ]) $, $ ([ 4 0 0 5 ]) $ $ ([ 1 3 2 6 ]) $, $ ([ 1 3 2 -6 ]) $    Yes, each has rank two. Yes, they have the same rank. No, they have different ranks.    Find the canonical representative of the matrix equivalence class of each matrix.  $ ([ 2 1 0 4 2 0 ]) $ $ ([ 0 1 0 2 1 1 0 4 3 3 3 -1 ]) $   We need only decide what the rank of each is.  $ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ $ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $    Suppose that, with respect to $ B=stdbasis(_2)  D=[1 1],[1 -1] $ the transformation $ t: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ is represented by this matrix. $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) $ Use change of basis matrices to represent $ t $ with respect to each pair.  $ B̂=[0 1],[1 1] $, $ D̂=[-1 0],[2 1] $ $ B̂=[1 2],[1 0] $, $ D̂=[1 2],[2 1] $   Recall the diagram and the formula. $  ℝ^2_{wrt(B)} → (T) ℝ^2_{wrt(D)} @V$I$ VV @V$I$ VV ℝ^2_{wrt(B̂)} → (T̂) ℝ^2_{wrt(D̂)}  T̂= I{D,D̂}· T· I{B̂,B} $  These two $ [1 1]=1·[-1 0] +1·[2 1]  [1 -1]=(-3)·[-1 0] +(-1)·[2 1] $ show that $ I{D,D̂}=([ 1 -3 1 -1 ]) $ and similarly these two $ [0 1]=0·[1 0] +1·[0 1]  [1 1]=1·[1 0] +1·[0 1] $ give the other nonsingular matrix. $ I{B̂,B}=([ 0 1 1 1 ]) $ Then the answer is this. $ T̂= ([ 1 -3 1 -1 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) ([ 0 1 1 1 ]) =([ -10 -18 -2 -4 ]) $ Although not strictly necessary, a check is reassuring. Arbitrarily fixing $ vec(v)=[3 2] $ we have that $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=[3 2]_B  ([ 1 2 3 4 ])_{B,D} [3 2]_B =[7 17]_D $ and so $t(vec(v))$ is this. $ 7·[1 1]+17·[1 -1]=[24 -10] $ Doing the calculation with respect to $B̂,D̂$ starts with $ rep{vec(v)}{B̂}=[-1 3]_{B̂}  ([ -10 -18 -2 -4 ])_{B̂,D̂} [-1 3]_{B̂} =[-44 -10]_{D̂} $ and then checks that this is the same result. $ -44·[-1 0]-10·[2 1]=[24 -10] $ These two $ [1 1]=(1/3)·[1 2] +(1/3)·[2 1]  [1 -1]=-1·[1 2] +1·[2 1] $ show that $ I{D,D̂}=([ 1/3 -1 1/3 1 ]) $ and these two $ [1 2]=1·[1 0] +2·[0 1]  [1 0]=-1·[1 0] +0·[0 1] $ show this. $ I{B̂,B}=([ 1 1 2 0 ]) $ With those, the conversion goes in this way. $ T̂=([ 1/3 -1 1/3 1 ]) ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) ([ 1 1 2 0 ]) =([ -28/3 -8/3 38/3 10/3 ]) $ As in the prior item, a check provides some confidence that we did this calculation without mistakes. We can for instance, fix the vector $ vec(v)=[-1 2] $ (this is arbitrary, taken from thin air). Now we have $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=[-1 2]  ([ 1 2 3 4 ])_{B,D} [-1 2]_{B} =[3 5]_D $ and so $t(vec(v))$ is this vector. $ 3·[1 1]+5·[1 -1]=[8 -2] $ With respect to $B̂,D̂$ we first calculate $ rep{vec(v)}{B̂}=[1 -2]  ([ -28/3 -8/3 38/3 10/3 ])_{B̂,D̂} [1 -2]_{B̂} =[-4 6]_{D̂} $ and, sure enough, that is the same result for $t(vec(v))$. $ -4·[1 2]+6·[2 1]=[8 -2] $    What sizes are $ P $ and $ Q $ in the equation $Ĥ=PHQ$?  Where $ H $ and $ Ĥ $ are $ N by M $, the matrix $ P $ is $ N by m $ while $ Q $ is $ N by N $.   Consider the spaces $V=polyspace(_2)$ and~$W=matspace(_){N by N}$, with these bases. begin(gather*) B=1, 1+x, 1+x^2  D=sequence{ ([ 0 0 0 1 ]), ([ 0 0 1 1 ]), ([ 0 1 1 1 ]), ([ 1 1 1 1 ]) } B̂=1, x, x^2  D̂=sequence{ ([ -1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 -1 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 1 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } end(gather*) We will find $P$ and~$Q$ to convert the representation of a map with respect to $B,D$ to one with respect to $B̂,D̂$  Draw the appropriate arrow diagram. Compute $P$ and~$Q$.     For the equation $Ĥ=PHQ$ this is the arrow diagram. $  V_{wrt(B)} → (H) W_{wrt(D)} @V{$I$} VV @V{$I$} VV V_{wrt(B̂)} → (Ĥ) W_{wrt(D̂)}  $  We want $P=I{B̂,B}$ and~$Q=I{D,D̂}$. For $P$ we do these calculations (done here by eye). $ Representation of (I(1))=[1 0 0]  Representation of (I(x))=[-1 1 0]  Representation of (I(x^2))=[-1 0 1] $ These calcuations give $Q$. $ rep{I( ([ 0 0 0 1 ]))}{D̂}=[0 0 0 1]  rep{I( ([ 0 0 1 1 ]))}{D̂}=[0 0 1 1]  rep{I( ([ 0 1 1 1 ]))}{D̂}=[0 -1 1 1] rep{I( ([ 1 1 1 1 ]))}{D̂}=[-1 -1 1 1] $ This is the answer. $ P=([ 1 -1 -1 0 1 0 0 0 1 ])  Q= ([ 0 0 0 -1 0 0 -1 -1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ]) $     Find the $P$ and~$Q$ to express $H$ via $PHQ$ as a block partial identity matrix. $ H= ([ 2 1 1 3 -1 0 1 3 2 ]) $  Gauss's Method gives this. $ ([ 2 1 1 3 -1 0 1 3 2 ]) for step $-(3/2)ρ_1+ρ_2$ for step $ρ_2+ρ_3$ for step $(1/2)ρ_1$ ([ 1 1/2 1/2 0 1 3/5 0 0 0 ]) $ Column operations complete the job of reaching the canonical form for matrix equivalence. $ grstep(-(3/5)col_2+col_3) grstep[-(1/5)col_1+col_3]{-(1/2)col_1+col_2} ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Then these are the two matrices. $ P = ([ 1 0 0 0 -2/5 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1/2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 -1/2 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 -3/2 1 0 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 1/2 0 0 3/5 -2/5 0 -2 1 1 ]) Q = ([ 1 0 0 0 1 -3/5 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 -1/2 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 -1/5 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 1 1/2 -1/5 0 1 -3/5 0 0 1 ]) $   Use to show that a square matrix is nonsingular if and only if it is equivalent to an identity matrix.  Any $ N by N $ matrix is nonsingular if and only if it has rank $ n $, that is, by , if and only if it is matrix equivalent to the $N by N$ matrix whose diagonal is all ones.   Show that, where $ A $ is a nonsingular square matrix, if $ P $ and $ Q $ are nonsingular square matrices such that $ PAQ=I $ then $ QP=A^{-1} $.  If $ PAQ=I $ then $ QPAQ=Q $, so $ QPA=I $, and so $ QP=A^{-1} $.   Why does not show that every matrix is diagonalizable (see )?  By the definition following , a matrix $M$ is diagonalizable if it represents $M=Representation of (t)$ a transformation with the property that there is some basis $B̂$ such that $t{B̂,B̂}$ is a diagonal matrix- the starting and ending bases must be equal. But says only that there are $B̂$ and $D̂$ such that we can change to a representation $t{B̂,D̂}$ and get a diagonal matrix. We have no reason to suspect that we could pick the two $B̂$ and $D̂$ so that they are equal.   Must matrix equivalent matrices have matrix equivalent transposes?  Yes. Row rank equals column rank, so the rank of the transpose equals the rank of the matrix. Same-sized matrices with equal ranks are matrix equivalent.   What happens in if $ k=0 $?  Only a zero matrix has rank zero.   Show that matrix equivalence is an equivalence relation.  For reflexivity, to show that any matrix is matrix equivalent to itself, take $ P $ and $ Q $ to be identity matrices. For symmetry, if $ H_1=PH_2Q $ then $ H_2=P^{-1}H_1Q^{-1} $ (inverses exist because $P$ and $Q$ are nonsingular). Finally, for transitivity, assume that $ H_1=P_2H_2Q_2 $ and that $ H_2=P_3H_3Q_3 $. Then substitution gives $ H_1=P_2(P_3H_3Q_3)Q_2=(P_2P_3)H_3(Q_3Q_2) $. A product of nonsingular matrices is nonsingular (we've shown that the product of invertible matrices is invertible;~in fact, we've shown how to calculate the inverse) and so $ H_1 $ is therefore matrix equivalent to $ H_3 $.   Show that a zero matrix is alone in its matrix equivalence class. Are there other matrices like that?  By , a zero matrix is alone in its class because it is the only $ N by M $ of rank zero. No other matrix is alone in its class; any nonzero scalar product of a matrix has the same rank as that matrix.   What are the matrix equivalence classes of matrices of transformations on $ ℝ^1 $? $ ℝ^3 $?  There are two matrix equivalence classes of $ N by N $ matrices- those of rank zero and those of rank one. The $ N by N $ matrices fall into four matrix equivalence classes.   How many matrix equivalence classes are there?  For $ N by M $ matrices there are classes for each possible rank: where $ k $ is the minimum of $ m $ and $ n $ there are classes for the matrices of rank $ 0 $, $ 1 $, ..., $ k $. That's $ k+1 $ classes. (Of course, totaling over all sizes of matrices we get infinitely many classes.)   Are matrix equivalence classes closed under scalar multiplication? Addition?  They are closed under nonzero scalar multiplication since a nonzero scalar multiple of a matrix has the same rank as does the matrix. They are not closed under addition, for instance, $ H+(-H) $ has rank zero.   Let $ t: ℝ^n → ℝ^n $ represented by $ T $ with respect to $ stdbasis(_n),stdbasis(_n) $.  Find $Representation of (t)$ in this specific case. $ T=([ 1 1 3 -1 ])  B=sequence{[1 2], [-1 -1]} $ Describe $Representation of (t)$ in the general case where $ B=basis(β){n} $.    We have $ Representation of (I)= ([ 1 -1 2 -1 ]) $ and $ Representation of (I)=Representation of (I)^{-1}= ([ 1 -1 2 -1 ])^{-1} =([ -1 1 -2 1 ]) $ and thus the answer is this. $ Representation of (t) = ([ 1 -1 2 -1 ]) ([ 1 1 3 -1 ]) ([ -1 1 -2 1 ]) =([ -2 0 -5 2 ]) $ As a quick check, we can take a vector at random $ vec(v)=[4 5] $ giving $ rep{vec(v)}{stdbasis(_2)}=[4 5]  ([ 1 1 3 -1 ]) [4 5] =[9 7]=t(vec(v)) $ while the calculation with respect to $B,B$ $ rep{vec(v)}{B}=[1 -3]  ([ -2 0 -5 2 ])_{B,B} [1 -3]_B =[-2 -11]_B $ yields the same result. $ -2·[1 2]-11·[-1 -1] =[9 7] $ We have $  ℝ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} → (T) ℝ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} @V$I$ VV @V$I$ VV ℝ^2_{wrt(B)} → (T̂) ℝ^2_{wrt(B)}   Representation of (t)=Representation of (I) · T · Representation of (I) $ and, as in the first item of this question $ Representation of (I) =([ vec(β)_1 ·s vec(β)_n ])  Representation of (I)=Representation of (I)^{-1} $ so, writing $Q$ for the matrix whose columns are the basis vectors, we have that $Representation of (t)=Q^{-1}TQ$.     Let $ V $ have bases $ B_1 $ and $ B_2 $ and suppose that $ W $ has the basis $ D $. Where $ h: V → W $, find the formula that computes $ Representation of (h) $ from $ Representation of (h) $. Repeat the prior question with one basis for $ V $ and two bases for $ W $.    The adapted form of the arrow diagram is this. $  V_{wrt(B_1)} → (H) W_{wrt(D)} @V$I$ VQV @V$I$ VPV V_{wrt(B_2)} → (Ĥ) W_{wrt(D)}  $ Since there is no need to change bases in $ W $ (or we can say that the change of basis matrix $P$ is the identity), we have $ Representation of (h)=Representation of (h)· Q $ where $ Q=Representation of (I) $. Here, this is the arrow diagram. $  V_{wrt(B)} → (H) W_{wrt(D_1)} @V$I$ VQV @V$I$ VPV V_{wrt(B)} → (Ĥ) W_{wrt(D_2)}  $ We have that $ Representation of (h)=P· Representation of (h) $ where $ P=Representation of (I) $.     If two matrices are matrix equivalent and invertible, must their inverses be matrix equivalent? If two matrices have matrix equivalent inverses, must the two be matrix equivalent? If two matrices are square and matrix equivalent, must their squares be matrix equivalent? If two matrices are square and have matrix equivalent squares, must they be matrix equivalent?    Here is the arrow diagram, and a version of that diagram for inverse functions. $  V_{wrt(B)} → (H) W_{wrt(D)} @V$I$ VQV @V$I$ VPV V_{wrt(B̂)} → (Ĥ) W_{wrt(D̂)}    V_{wrt(B)} @<h^{-1}<H^{-1}< W_{wrt(D)} @V$I$ VQV @V$I$ VPV V_{wrt(B̂)} @<h^{-1}<Ĥ^{-1}< W_{wrt(D̂)}  $ Yes, the inverses of the matrices represent the inverses of the maps. That is, we can move from the lower right to the lower left by moving up, then left, then down. In other words, where $ Ĥ=PHQ $ (and $ P,Q $ invertible) and $ H,Ĥ $ are invertible then $ Ĥ^{-1}=Q^{-1}H^{-1}P^{-1} $. Yes; this is the prior part repeated in different terms. No, we need another assumption:~if $ H $ represents $ h $ with respect to the same starting as ending bases $ B,B $, for some $ B $ then $ H^2 $ represents $ ∘{h}{h} $. As a specific example, these two matrices are both rank one and so they are matrix equivalent $ ([ 1 0 0 0 ])  ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $ but the squares are not matrix equivalent- the square of the first has rank one while the square of the second has rank zero. No. These two are not matrix equivalent but have matrix equivalent squares. $ ([ 0 0 0 0 ])  ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $    Square matrices are similar if they represent the same transformation, but each with respect to the same ending as starting basis. That is, $ Representation of (t) $ is similar to $ Representation of (t) $.  Give a definition of matrix similarity like that of def:MatEquiv. Prove that similar matrices are matrix equivalent. Show that similarity is an equivalence relation. Show that if $ T $ is similar to $ T̂ $ then $ T^2 $ is similar to $ T̂^2 $, the cubes are similar, etc. Contrast with the prior exercise. Prove that there are matrix equivalent matrices that are not similar.    The arrow diagram suggests the definition. $  V_{wrt(B_1)} → (T) V_{wrt(B_1)} @V$I$ VV @Vscriptsize$I$ VV V_{wrt(B_2)} → (T̂) V_{wrt(B_2)}  $ Call matrices $ T, T̂ $ similar if there is a nonsingular matrix $ P $ such that $ T̂=P^{-1}TP $. Take $ P^{-1} $ to be $ P $ and take $ P $ to be $ Q $. This is as in . Reflexivity is obvious: $ T=I^{-1}TI $. Symmetry is also easy: $ T̂=P^{-1}TP $ implies that $ T=PT̂P^{-1} $ (multiply the first equation from the right by $P^{-1}$ and from the left by $P$). For transitivity, assume that $ T_1={P_2}^{-1}T_2P_2 $ and that $ T_2={P_3}^{-1}T_3P_3 $. Then $ T_1={P_2}^{-1}({P_3}^{-1}T_3P_3)P_2 =({P_2}^{-1}{P_3}^{-1})T_3(P_3P_2) $ and we are finished on noting that $ P_3P_2 $ is an invertible matrix with inverse $ {P_2}^{-1}{P_3}^{-1} $. Assume $ T̂=P^{-1}TP $. For squares, $ T̂^2=(P^{-1}TP)(P^{-1}TP) =P^{-1}T(PP^{-1})TP=P^{-1}T^2P $. Higher powers follow by induction. These two are matrix equivalent but their squares are not matrix equivalent. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 ])  ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $ By the prior item, matrix similarity and matrix equivalence are thus different.             textit{This section is optional. It is a prerequisite only for the final two sections of Chapter Five, and some Topics.}  We have described projection from $ ℝ^3$ into its $ xy $-plane subspace as a shadow map. This shows why but it also shows that some shadows fall upward.      vspace*{1ex} So perhaps a better description is:~the projection of $vec(v)$ is the vector $vec(p)$ in the plane with the property that someone standing on $vec(p)$ and looking straight up or down- that is, looking orthogonally to the plane- sees the tip of $vec(v)$. In this section we will generalize this to other projections, orthogonal and non-orthogonal.                  We first consider orthogonal projection of a vector $ vec(v) $ into a line $l$.     This shows a figure walking out on the line to a point $vec(p)$ such that the tip of $vec(v)$ is directly above them, where ``above'' does not mean parallel to the $y$-axis but instead means orthogonal to the line.      Since the line is the span of some vector $l={c·vec{{s} such that c in ℝ}$, we have a coefficient $c_{vec(p)}$ with the property that $vec(v)-c_{vec(p)}vec(s)$ is orthogonal to $c_{vec(p)}vec(s)$.      To solve for this coefficient, observe that because $vec(v)-c_{vec(p)}vec(s)$ is orthogonal to a scalar multiple of $vec(s)$, it must be orthogonal to $vec(s)$ itself. Then $(vec(v)-c_{vec(p)}vec(s))dot product of vec(s)=0$ gives that $c_{vec(p)}=vec(v)dot product of vec(s)/vec(s)dot product of vec(s)$.     The definend{orthogonal projection of $ vec(v) $ into the line spanned by a nonzero $ vec(s) $} is this vector. $ proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(s))}= frac{ vec(v)dot product of vec(s) }{ vec(s)dot product of vec(s) }·vec(s) $       (That says `spanned by $ vec(s) $' instead the more formal `span of the set $ {vec{{s}} $'. This more casual phrase is common.)  For example To orthogonally project the vector $(2 choose 3)$ into the line $ y=2x $, first pick a direction vector for the line. $ vec(s)=[1 2] $ The calculation is easy.    $frac( [2 3]dot product of [1 2] ){ [1 2]dot product of [1 2] } ·[1 2] ={ (8/5)}·[1 2]=[8/5 16/5]$    For example In $ ℝ^3 $, the orthogonal projection of a general vector $ [x y z] $ into the $ y $-axis is $ frac( [x y z]dot product of [0 1 0] ){ [0 1 0]dot product of [0 1 0] } ·[0 1 0]=[0 y 0] $ which matches our intuitive expectation.   The picture above showing the figure walking out on the line until $vec(v)$'s tip is overhead is one way to think of the orthogonal projection of a vector into a line. We finish this subsection with two other ways.   For example A railroad car left on an east-west track without its brake is pushed by a wind blowing toward the northeast at fifteen miles per hour; what speed will the car reach?    For the wind we use a vector of length $15$ that points toward the northeast. $ vec(v)=[15√{1/2] 15√{1/2}} $ The car is only affected by the part of the wind blowing in the east-west direction- the part of $vec(v)$ in the direction of the $x$-axis is this (the picture has the same perspective as the railroad car picture above).    $ vec(p)=[15√{1/2] 0}$  So the car will reach a velocity of $ 15√{1/2} $ miles per hour toward the east.   Thus, another way to think of the picture that precedes the definition is that it shows $vec(v)$ as decomposed into two parts, the part $vec(p)$ with the line, and the part that is orthogonal to the line (shown above on the north-south axis). These two are non-interacting in the sense that the east-west car is not at all affected by the north-south part of the wind (see ). So we can think of the orthogonal projection of $ vec(v) $ into the line spanned by $ vec(s) $ as the part of $ vec(v) $ that lies in the direction of $ vec(s) $.  Still another useful way to think of orthogonal projection into a line is to have the person stand on the vector, not the line. This person holds a rope looped over the line. As they pull, the loop slides on the line.    When it is tight, the rope is orthogonal to the line. That is, we can think of the projection $ vec(p) $ as being the vector in the line that is closest to $ vec(v) $ (see ).  For example A submarine is tracking a ship moving along the line $ y=3x+2 $. Torpedo range is one-half mile. If the sub stays where it is, at the origin on the chart below, will the ship pass within range?    The formula for projection into a line does not immediately apply because the line doesn't pass through the origin, and so isn't the span of any $vec(s)$. To adjust for this, we start by shifting the entire map down two units. Now the line is $y=3x$, a subspace. We project to get the point $vec(p)$ on the line closest to $ vec(v)=[0 -2] $ the sub's shifted position. $ vec(p)=frac([0 -2]dot product of [1 3]){ [1 3]dot product of [1 3]} · [1 3]=[-3/5 -9/5] $ The distance between $vec(v)$ and $vec(p)$ is about $ 0.63 $~miles. The ship will never be in range.      Project the first vector orthogonally into the line spanned by the second vector.  $ [2 1] $, $ [3 -2] $ mbox{$ [2 1] $, $ [3 0] $} mbox{$ [1 1 4] $, $ [1 2 -1] $} mbox{$ [1 1 4] $, $ [3 3 12] $}       $ frac([2 1]dot product of [3 -2]){ [3 -2]dot product of [3 -2]} ·[3 -2] =(4/13) ·[3 -2] =[12/13 -8/13]$  $ frac([2 1]dot product of [3 0]){ [3 0]dot product of [3 0]} ·[3 0] =(2/3) ·[3 0] =[2 0]$  $ frac([1 1 4]dot product of [1 2 -1]){ [1 2 -1]dot product of [1 2 -1]} ·[1 2 -1] =(-1/6) ·[1 2 -1] =[-1/6 -1/3 1/6]$  $ frac([1 1 4]dot product of [3 3 12]){ [3 3 12]dot product of [3 3 12]} ·[3 3 12] =(1/3) ·[3 3 12] =[1 1 4]$    Project the vector orthogonally into the line.   $[2 -1 4],~{c[-3 1 -3] such that c in ℝ}$ $[-1 -1]$,~the line $y=3x$     $ frac([2 -1 4]dot product of [-3 1 -3]){ [-3 1 -3]dot product of [-3 1 -3]} ·[-3 1 -3] =(-19/19)·[-3 1 -3] =[3 -1 3]$ Writing the line as $ {c· [1 3] such that c in ℝ} $ gives this projection. $ frac([-1 -1]dot product of [1 3]){ [1 3]dot product of [1 3]} ·[1 3] =(-4/10)·[1 3] =[-2/5 -6/5] $    Although pictures guided our development of def:ProjIntoLine, we are not restricted to spaces that we can draw. In $ ℝ^4$ project this vector into this line. $ vec(v)=[1 2 1 3]  l={c·[-1 1 -1 1] such that c in ℝ} $  $ frac([1 2 1 3]dot product of [-1 1 -1 1]){ [-1 1 -1 1]dot product of [-1 1 -1 1]} ·[-1 1 -1 1] =(3/4) ·[-1 1 -1 1] =[-3/4 3/4 -3/4 3/4]$   def:ProjIntoLine uses two vectors $vec(s)$ and $vec(v)$. Consider the transformation of $ ℝ^2$ resulting from fixing $ vec(s)=[3 1] $ and projecting $vec(v)$ into the line that is the span of $vec(s)$. Apply it to these vectors.  $[1 2]$ $[0 4]$  Show that in general the projection transformation is this. $ [x_1 x_2] ↦ [(x_1+3x_2)/10 (3x_1+9x_2)/10] $ Express the action of this transformation with a matrix.   $ frac([1 2]dot product of [3 1]){ [3 1]dot product of [3 1]} · [3 1] =(1/2)·[3 1] =[3/2 1/2]$ $ frac([0 4]dot product of [3 1]){ [3 1]dot product of [3 1]} · [3 1] =(2/5)·[3 1] =[6/5 2/5]$  In general the projection is this. $ frac([x_1 x_2]dot product of [3 1]){ [3 1]dot product of [3 1]} · [3 1] =(3x_1+x_2/10)·[3 1] =[(9x_1+3x_2)/10 (3x_1+x_2)/10] $ The appropriate matrix is this. $ ([ 9/10 3/10 3/10 1/10 ]) $   suggests that projection breaks $vec(v)$ into two parts, $proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(s))}$ and $vec(v)-proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(s))}$, that are non-interacting. Recall that the two are orthogonal. Show that any two nonzero orthogonal vectors make up a linearly independent set.  Suppose that $vec(v)_1$ and $vec(v)_2$ are nonzero and orthogonal. Consider the linear relationship $c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2=0$. Take the dot product of both sides of the equation with $vec(v)_1$ to get that $ vec(v)_1dot product of (c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2) =c_1·(vec(v)_1dot product of vec(v)_1) +c_2·(vec(v)_1dot product of vec(v)_2) =c_1· (vec(v)_1dot product of vec(v)_1)+c_2· 0 =c_1· (vec(v)_1dot product of vec(v)_1) $ is equal to $vec(v)_1dot product of 0=0$. With the assumption that $vec(v)_1$ is nonzero, this gives that $c_1$ is zero. Showing that $c_2$ is zero is similar.    What is the orthogonal projection of $ vec(v) $ into a line if $ vec(v) $ is a member of that line? Show that if $vec(v)$ is not a member of the line then the set ${vec{{v},vec{{v}-proj{{vec{{v}}{{span({vec{{s)}}}$ is linearly independent.    If the vector $vec(v)$ is in the line then the orthogonal projection is $ vec(v) $. To verify this by calculation, note that since $vec(v)$ is in the line we have that $ vec(v)=c_{vec(v)}·vec(s) $ for some scalar $c_{vec(v)}$. $ frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}·vec(s) =frac{c_{vec(v)}· vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}{ vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}·vec(s) =c_{vec(v)}·frac{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}{ vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}·vec(s) =c_{vec(v)}· 1 ·vec(s) =vec(v) $ (Remark. If we assume that $vec(v)$ is nonzero then we can simplify the above by taking $vec(s)$ to be $vec(v)$.) Write $c_{vec(p)}vec(s)$ for the projection $proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(s))}$. Note that, by the assumption that $vec(v)$ is not in the line, both $vec(v)$ and $vec(v)-c_{vec(p)}vec(s)$ are nonzero. Note also that if $c_{vec(p)}$ is zero then we are actually considering the one-element set ${vec{{v}}$, and with $vec(v)$ nonzero, this set is necessarily linearly independent. Therefore, we are left considering the case that $c_{vec(p)}$ is nonzero.  Setting up a linear relationship $ a_1(vec(v))+a_2(vec(v)-c_{vec(p)}vec(s))=0 $ leads to the equation $(a_1+a_2)·vec(v)=a_2c_{vec(p)}·vec(s)$. Because $vec(v)$ isn't in the line, the scalars $a_1+a_2$ and $a_2 c_{vec(p)}$ must both be zero. We handled the $c_{vec(p)}=0$ case above, so the remaining case is that $a_2=0$, and this gives that $a_1=0$ also. Hence the set is linearly independent.    def:ProjIntoLine requires that $vec(s)$ be nonzero. Why? What is the right definition of the orthogonal projection of a vector into the (degenerate) line spanned by the zero vector?  If $vec(s)$ is the zero vector then the expression $ proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(s))}= frac{ vec(v)dot product of vec(s) }{ vec(s)dot product of vec(s) }·vec(s) $ contains a division by zero, and so is undefined. As for the right definition, for the projection to lie in the span of the zero vector, it must be defined to be $ 0 $.   Are all vectors the projection of some other vector into some line?  Any vector in $ ℝ^n $ is the projection of some other into a line, provided that the dimension $ n $ is greater than one. (Clearly, any vector is the projection of itself into a line containing itself; the question is to produce some vector other than $vec(v)$ that projects to $ vec(v) $.)  Suppose that $ vec(v) in ℝ^n $ with $ n>1 $. If $ vec(v) ≠0 $ then we consider the line $ l={cvec{{v} such that c in ℝ} $ and if $ vec(v)=0 $ we take $ l $ to be any (non-degenerate) line at all (actually, we needn't distinguish between these two cases- see the prior exercise). Let $ v_1,...,v_n $ be the components of $ vec(v) $; since $ n>1 $, there are at least two. If some $ v_i $ is zero then the vector $ vec(w)=vec(e)_i $ is perpendicular to $ vec(v) $. If none of the components is zero then the vector $ vec(w) $ whose components are $ v_2,-v_1,0,... ,0 $ is perpendicular to $ vec(v) $. In either case, observe that $ vec(v)+vec(w) $ does not equal $ vec(v) $, and that $ vec(v) $ is the projection of $ vec(v)+vec(w) $ into $ l $. $ frac{ (vec(v)+vec(w))dot product of vec(v) }{ vec(v)dot product of vec(v) }·vec(v) =[(frac{ vec(v)dot product of vec(v) }{ vec(v)dot product of vec(v) }+ frac{ vec(w)dot product of vec(v) }{ \ vec(v)dot product of vec(v) }])·vec(v) =frac{ vec(v)dot product of vec(v) }{ vec(v)dot product of vec(v) }·vec(v) =vec(v) $  We can dispose of the remaining $n=0$ and $n=1$ cases. The dimension $ n=0 $ case is the trivial vector space, here there is only one vector and so it cannot be expressed as the projection of a different vector. In the dimension $n=1$ case there is only one (non-degenerate) line, and every vector is in it, hence every vector is the projection only of itself.   Show that the projection of $ vec(v) $ into the line spanned by $ vec(s) $ has length equal to the absolute value of the number $ vec(v)dot product of vec(s) $ divided by the length of the vector $ vec(s) $.  The proof is simply a calculation. $ norm{frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)} ·vec(s) } = absval{frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{ vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}}· norm{vec(s) } = frac{|vec(v)dot product of vec(s)|}{ norm{vec(s)}^2}·norm{vec(s)} = frac{|vec(v)dot product of vec(s)|}{norm{vec(s)}} $   Find the formula for the distance from a point to a line.  Because the projection of $ vec(v) $ into the line spanned by $ vec(s) $ is $ frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}·vec(s) $ the distance squared from the point to the line is this (we write a vector dotted with itself $vec(w)dot product of vec(w)$ as $vec(w)^2$). $ norm{vec(v)- frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)} ·vec(s) }^2 =vec(v)dot product of vec(v) -vec(v)dot product of ( frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}·vec(s) ) -( frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)} ·vec(s) )dot product of vec(v) +(frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{ vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}·vec(s))^2 =vec(v)dot product of vec(v) -2·(frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}) ·vec(v)dot product of vec(s) +(frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{ vec(s)dot product of vec(s)})·vec(s)dot product of vec(s) =frac{(vec(v)dot product of vec(v))·(vec(s)dot product of vec(s)) -2·(vec(v)dot product of vec(s))^2 +(vec(v)dot product of vec(s))^2}{ vec(s)dot product of vec(s)} =frac{(vec(v)dot product of vec(v))(vec(s)dot product of vec(s)) -(vec(v)dot product of vec(s))^2}{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)} $   Find the scalar $ c $ such that the point $ (cs_1,cs_2) $ is a minimum distance from the point $ (v_1,v_2) $ by using calculus (i.e., consider the distance function, set the first derivative equal to zero, and solve). Generalize to $ ℝ^n $.  Because square root is a strictly increasing function, we can minimize $ d(c)=(cs_1-v_1)^2+(cs_2-v_2)^2 $ instead of the square root of $ d $. The derivative is $dd/dc=2(cs_1-v_1)· s_1 +2(cs_2-v_2)· s_2$. Setting it equal to zero $2(cs_1-v_1)· s_1 +2(cs_2-v_2)· s_2 =c·(2s_1^2+2s_2^2)-(v_1s_1+v_2s_2)=0$ gives the only critical point. $ c=frac(v_1s_1+v_2s_2){{s_1}^2+{s_2}^2} =frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)} $ Now the second derivative with respect to $c$ $ (d^2d/dc^2)=2{s_1}^2+2{s_2}^2 $ is strictly positive (as long as neither $ s_1 $ nor $ s_2 $ is zero, in which case the question is trivial) and so the critical point is a minimum.  The generalization to $ ℝ^n$ is straightforward. Consider $d_n(c)=(cs_1-v_1)^2+...+(cs_n-v_n)^2$, take the derivative, etc.   Prove that the orthogonal projection of a vector into a line is shorter than the vector.  The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality $|vec(v)dot product of vec(s)| ≤norm{vec(v)}·norm{vec(s)}$ gives that this fraction $ norm{frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{vec(s)dot product of vec(s)} ·vec(s) } =absval{frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(s)}{ vec(s)dot product of vec(s)}} ·norm{vec(s) } = frac{|vec(v)dot product of vec(s)|}{ norm{vec(s)}^2}·norm{vec(s)} = frac{|vec(v)dot product of vec(s)|}{norm{vec(s)}} $ when divided by $ norm{vec(v)} $ is less than or equal to one. That is, $ norm{vec(v)} $ is larger than or equal to the fraction.   Show that the definition of orthogonal projection into a line does not depend on the spanning vector:~if $ vec(s) $ is a nonzero multiple of $ vec(q) $ then $ (vec(v)dot product of vec(s)/vec(s)dot product of vec(s))·vec(s) $ equals $ (vec(v)dot product of vec(q)/vec(q)dot product of vec(q))·vec(q) $.  Write $ cvec(s) $ for $ vec(q) $, and calculate: $ (vec(v)dot product of cvec(s)/cvec(s)dot product of cvec(s))· cvec(s)= (vec(v)dot product of vec(s)/vec(s)dot product of vec(s))· vec(s) $.   Consider the function mapping the plane to itself that takes a vector to its projection into the line $ y=x $. These two each show that the map is linear, the first one in a way that is coordinate-bound (that is, it fixes a basis and then computes) and the second in a way that is more conceptual.  Produce a matrix that describes the function's action. Show that we can obtain this map by first rotating everything in the plane $ π/4 $~radians clockwise, then projecting into the $ x $-axis, and then rotating $ π/4 $~radians counterclockwise.    Fixing $ vec(s)=[1 1] $ as the vector whose span is the line, the formula gives this action, $ [x y] ↦ frac([x y]dot product of [1 1]){ [1 1]dot product of [1 1]}·[1 1] =(x+y/2)·[1 1] =[(x+y)/2 (x+y)/2] $ which is the effect of this matrix. $ ([ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 ]) $ Rotating the entire plane $π/4$~radians clockwise brings the $y=x$~line to lie on the $x$-axis. Now projecting and then rotating back has the desired effect.    For $ vec(a),vec(b) in ℝ^n $ let $ vec(v)_1 $ be the projection of $ vec(a) $ into the line spanned by $ vec(b) $, let $ vec(v)_2 $ be the projection of $ vec(v)_1 $ into the line spanned by $ vec(a) $, let $ vec(v)_3 $ be the projection of $ vec(v)_2 $ into the line spanned by $ vec(b) $, etc., back and forth between the spans of $vec(a)$ and $vec(b)$. That is, $vec(v)_{i+1}$ is the projection of $vec(v)_i$ into the span of $vec(a)$ if $i+1$ is even, and into the span of $vec(b)$ if $i+1$ is odd. Must that sequence of vectors eventually settle down- must there be a sufficiently large~$i$ such that $ vec(v)_{i+2} $ equals $ vec(v)_{i} $ and $ vec(v)_{i+3} $ equals $ vec(v)_{i+1} $? If so, what is the earliest such~$i$?  The sequence need not settle down. With $ vec(a)=[1 0]  vec(b)=[1 1] $ the projections are these. $ vec(v)_1=[1/2 1/2],  vec(v)_2=[1/2 0],  vec(v)_3=[1/4 1/4],  ... $ This sequence doesn't repeat.                              The prior subsection suggests that projecting $vec(v)$ into the line spanned by $ vec(s) $ decomposes that vector into two parts     $ vec(v)=proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(s))} +(vec(v)-proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(s))})$  that are orthogonal and so are ``non-interacting.'' We now develop that suggestion.    Vectors $ vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_k in ℝ^n $ are mutually orthogonal when any two are orthogonal:~if $ i ≠ j $ then the dot product $ vec(v)_idot product of vec(v)_j $ is zero.      If the vectors in a set $ {vec{{v}_1,...,vec{{v}_k}⊆ ℝ^n $ are mutually orthogonal and nonzero then that set is linearly independent.      Consider $ 0=c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2+...+c_kvec(v)_k $. For $i in {1,..,k}$, taking the dot product of $ vec(v)_i $ with both sides of the equation $vec(v)_idot product of (c_1vec(v)_1+c_2vec(v)_2+...+c_kvec(v)_k) =vec(v)_idot product of 0$, which gives $c_i·(vec(v)_idot product of vec(v)_i)=0$, shows that $ c_i= 0 $ since $ vec(v)_i ≠0 $.      In a $k$~dimensional vector space, if the vectors in a size~$ k $ set are mutually orthogonal and nonzero then that set is a basis for the space.      Any linearly independent size~$ k $ subset of a $k$~dimensional space is a basis.    Of course, the converse of does not hold- not every basis of every subspace of $ ℝ^n$ has mutually orthogonal vectors. However, we can get the partial converse that for every subspace of $ ℝ^n$ there is at least one basis consisting of mutually orthogonal vectors.  For example The members $vec(β)_1$ and $vec(β)_2$ of this basis for $ ℝ^2$ are not orthogonal.  $ B=sequence{ [4 2], [1 3] }$    We will derive from $B$ a new basis for the space $sequence{vec(κ)_1,vec(κ)_2}$ consisting of mutually orthogonal vectors. The first member of the new basis is just $vec(β)_1$. $ vec(κ)_1=[4 2] $ For the second member of the new basis, we subtract from $vec(β)_2$ the part in the direction of $vec(κ)_1$. This leaves the part of $vec(β)_2$ that is orthogonal to $vec(κ)_1$.    $ vec(κ)_2=[1 3] -proj{[1 3]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} =[1 3]-[2 1]=[-1 2]$    By the corollary $sequence{vec(κ)_1,vec(κ)_2}$ is a basis for $ ℝ^2$.     An orthogonal basis  for a vector space is a basis of mutually orthogonal vectors.        For example To produce from this basis for $ ℝ^3$ $ B=sequence{ [1 1 1], [0 2 0], [1 0 3] } $ an orthogonal basis, start by taking the first vector unchanged. $ vec(κ)_1=[1 1 1] $ Get $ vec(κ)_2 $ by subtracting from $vec(β)_2$ its part in the direction of $ vec(κ)_1 $. $ vec(κ)_2=[0 2 0] -proj{[0 2 0]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} =[0 2 0]-[2/3 2/3 2/3] =[-2/3 4/3 -2/3] $ Find $vec(κ)_3$ by subtracting from $vec(β)_3$ the part in the direction of $ vec(κ)_1 $ and also the part in the direction of $ vec(κ)_2 $. $ vec(κ)_3=[1 0 3] -proj{[1 0 3]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} -proj{[1 0 3]}{span(vec(κ)_2)} =[-1 0 1] $ As above, the corollary gives that the result is a basis for $ ℝ^3$. $ sequence{ [1 1 1], [-2/3 4/3 -2/3], [-1 0 1] } $    [Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization]    If $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...vec(β)_k} $ is a basis for a subspace of $ ℝ^n $ then the vectors $ vec(κ)_1 =vec(β)_1 vec(κ)_2 =vec(β)_2-proj{vec(β)_2}{span(vec(κ)_1)} vec(κ)_3 =vec(β)_3 -proj{vec(β)_3}{span(vec(κ)_1)} -proj{vec(β)_3}{span(vec(κ)_2)} ... vec(κ)_k =vec(β)_k -proj{vec(β)_k}{span(vec(κ)_1)}-·s -proj{vec(β)_k}{span(vec{κ)_{k-1}}} $ form an orthogonal basis for the same subspace.     This is restricted to $ ℝ^n$ only because we have not given a definition of orthogonality for other spaces.     We will use induction to check that each $ vec(κ)_i $ is nonzero, is in the span of $sequence{vec(β)_1,...vec(β)_i}$, and is orthogonal to all preceding vectors $ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_i= ·s =vec(κ)_{i-1}dot product of vec(κ)_{i}=0 $. Then gives that $ sequence{vec(κ)_1,...vec(κ)_k} $ is a basis for the same space as is the starting basis.    We shall only cover the cases up to $ i=3 $, to give the sense of the argument. The full argument is .    The $ i=1 $ case is trivial; taking $ vec(κ)_1 $ to be $ vec(β)_1 $ makes it a nonzero vector since $vec(β)_1$ is a member of a basis, it is obviously in the span of $sequence{vec(β)_1}$, and the `orthogonal to all preceding vectors' condition is satisfied vacuously.    In the $ i=2 $ case the expansion $ vec(κ)_2=vec(β)_2 -proj{vec(β)_2}{span(vec(κ)_1)}= vec(β)_2 -frac{vec(β)_2dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(κ)_1 = vec(β)_2 -frac{vec(β)_2dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(β)_1 $ shows that $vec(κ)_2 ≠ 0$ or else this would be a non-trivial linear dependence among the $ vec(β) $'s (it is nontrivial because the coefficient of $vec(β)_2$ is $1$). It also shows that $vec(κ)_2$ is in the span of $sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2}$. And, $vec(κ)_2$ is orthogonal to the only preceding vector $ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_2= vec(κ)_1dot product of (vec(β)_2 -proj{vec(β)_2}{span(vec(κ)_1)})=0 $ because this projection is orthogonal.    The $ i=3 $ case is the same as the $i=2$ case except for one detail. As in the $i=2$ case, expand the definition. $ vec(κ)_3 =vec(β)_3 -frac{vec(β)_3dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(κ)_1 -frac{vec(β)_3dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2} ·vec(κ)_2 =vec(β)_3 -frac{vec(β)_3dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(β)_1 -frac{vec(β)_3dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2} ·[(vec(β)_2 -frac{vec(β)_2dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(β)_1]) $ By the first line $vec(κ)_3 ≠0$, since $vec(β)_3$ isn't in the span~$span(vec{β)_1,vec(β)_2}$ and therefore by the inductive hypothesis it isn't in the span~$span(vec{κ)_1,vec(κ)_2}$. By the second line $vec(κ)_3$ is in the span of the first three $vec(β)$'s. Finally, the calculation below shows that $vec(κ)_3$ is orthogonal to $vec(κ)_1$.   $ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_3 =vec(κ)_1dot product of [(vec(β)_3 -proj{vec(β)_3}{span(vec(κ)_1)} -proj{vec(β)_3}{span(vec(κ)_2)}]) =vec(κ)_1dot product of [(vec(β)_3 -proj{vec(β)_3}{span(vec(κ)_1)}]) -vec(κ)_1dot product of proj{vec(β)_3}{span(vec(κ)_2)} =0 $ (Here is the difference with the $i=2$ case: as happened for $i=2$ the first term is~$0$ because this projection is orthogonal, but here the second term in the second line is~$0$ because $ vec(κ)_1 $ is orthogonal to $ vec(κ)_2 $ and so is orthogonal to any vector in the line spanned by $ vec(κ)_2 $.) A similar check shows that $vec(κ)_3$ is also orthogonal to $vec(κ)_2$.    In addition to having the vectors in the basis be orthogonal, we can also normalize each vector by dividing by its length, to end with an orthonormal basis. .  For example From the orthogonal basis of , normalizing produces this orthonormal basis. $ sequence{ [1/√{3] 1/√{3} 1/√{3}}, [-1/√{6] 2/√{6} -1/√{6}}, [-1/√{2] 0 1/√{2}} } $   Besides its intuitive appeal, and its analogy with the standard basis $stdbasis(_n)$ for $ ℝ^n$, an orthonormal basis also simplifies some computations. is an example.       Perform the Gram-Schmidt process on each of these bases for $ ℝ^2$.  $ sequence{ [1 1], [2 1] } $ $ sequence{ [0 1], [-1 3] } $ $ sequence{ [0 1], [-1 0] } $  Then turn those orthogonal bases into orthonormal bases.    $ vec(κ)_1 = [1 1] vec(κ)_2 = [2 1] -proj{[2 1]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} = [2 1] -frac([2 1]dot product of [1 1]){ [1 1]dot product of [1 1]} ·[1 1] = [2 1] -(3/2) ·[1 1] =[1/2 -1/2] $ This is the corresponding orthonormal basis. $ sequence{ [1/√{2] 1/√{2}}, [√{2]/2 -√{2}/2} } $  $ vec(κ)_1 = [0 1] vec(κ)_2 = [-1 3] -proj{[-1 3]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} = [-1 3] -frac([-1 3]dot product of [0 1]){ [0 1]dot product of [0 1]} ·[0 1] = [-1 3] -(3/1) ·[0 1] =[-1 0] $ Here is the orthonormal basis. $ sequence{ [0 1], [-1 0] } $  $ vec(κ)_1 = [0 1] vec(κ)_2 = [-1 0] -proj{[-1 0]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} = [-1 0] -frac([-1 0]dot product of [0 1]){ [0 1]dot product of [0 1]} ·[0 1] = [-1 0] -(0/1) ·[0 1] =[-1 0] $  This is the associated orthonormal basis. $ sequence{ [0 1], [-1 0] } $   Perform the Gram-Schmidt process on each of these bases for $ ℝ^3$.  $ sequence{ [2 2 2], [1 0 -1], [0 3 1] } $ $ sequence{ [1 -1 0], [0 1 0], [2 3 1] } $  Then turn those orthogonal bases into orthonormal bases.   The first basis vector is unchanged. $ vec(κ)_1 = [2 2 2] $ The second one comes from this calculation. $ vec(κ)_2 = [1 0 -1] -proj{[1 0 -1]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} = [1 0 -1] -frac([1 0 -1]dot product of [2 2 2]){ [2 2 2]dot product of [2 2 2]} ·[2 2 2] = [1 0 -1] -(0/12) ·[2 2 2] =[1 0 -1] $ For the third the arithmetic is uglier but it is a straightforward calculation. $ vec(κ)_3 = [0 3 1] -proj{[0 3 1]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} -proj{[0 3 1]}{span(vec(κ)_2)} = [0 3 1] -frac([0 3 1]dot product of [2 2 2]){ [2 2 2]dot product of [2 2 2]} ·[2 2 2] -frac([0 3 1]dot product of [1 0 -1]){ [1 0 -1]dot product of [1 0 -1]} ·[1 0 -1] = [0 3 1] -(8/12) ·[2 2 2] -(-1/2) ·[1 0 -1] =[-5/6 5/3 -5/6] $ This is the orthonormal basis. $ sequence{ [1/√{3] 1/√{3} 1/√{3}}, [1/√{2] 0 -1/√{2}}, [-1/√{6] 2/√{6} -1/√{6}} } $ The first basis vector is what was given. $ vec(κ)_1 = [1 -1 0] $ The second is here. $ vec(κ)_2 = [0 1 0] -proj{[0 1 0]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} = [0 1 0] -frac([0 1 0]dot product of [1 -1 0]){ [1 -1 0]dot product of [1 -1 0]} ·[1 -1 0] = [0 1 0] -(-1/2) ·[1 -1 0] =[1/2 1/2 0] $ Here is the third. $ vec(κ)_3 = [2 3 1] -proj{[2 3 1]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} -proj{[2 3 1]}{span(vec(κ)_2)} = [2 3 1] -frac([2 3 1]dot product of [1 -1 0]){ [1 -1 0]dot product of [1 -1 0]} ·[1 -1 0] -frac([2 3 1]dot product of [1/2 1/2 0]){ [1/2 1/2 0]dot product of [1/2 1/2 0]} ·[1/2 1/2 0] = [2 3 1] -(-1/2) ·[1 -1 0] -(5/2/1/2) ·[1/2 1/2 0] =[0 0 1] $ Here is the associated orthonormal basis. $ sequence{ [1/√{2] -1/√{2} 0}, [1/√{2] 1/√{2} 0} [0 0 1] } $    Find an orthonormal basis for this subspace of $ ℝ^3$:~the plane $x-y+z=0$.  We can parametrize the given space can in this way. $ {[x y z] such that x=y-z} ={[1 1 0]· y+[-1 0 1]· z such that y,z in ℝ} $ So we take the basis $ sequence{[1 1 0], [-1 0 1]} $ apply the Gram-Schmidt process to get this first basis vector $ vec(κ)_1 = [1 1 0] $ and this second one. $ vec(κ)_2 = [-1 0 1]-proj{[-1 0 1]}{ span(vec(κ)_1)} = [-1 0 1] -frac([-1 0 1]dot product of [1 1 0]){ [1 1 0]dot product of [1 1 0]} ·[1 1 0] = [-1 0 1] -(-1/2)·[1 1 0] =[-1/2 1/2 1] $ and then normalize. $ sequence{ [1/√{2] 1/√{2} 0}, [-1/√{6] 1/√{6} 2/√{6}} } $   Find an orthonormal basis for this subspace of $ ℝ^4$. $ {[x y z w] such that x-y-z+w=0{ and x+z=0} $  Reducing the linear system $ $ x - y - z + w = 0 x + z = 0 $ for step $-ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x - y - z + w = 0 y + 2z - w = 0 $ $ and parametrizing gives this description of the subspace. $ {[-1 -2 1 0]· z +[0 1 0 1]· w such that z,w in ℝ} $ So we take the basis, $ sequence{ [-1 -2 1 0], [0 1 0 1] } $ go through the Gram-Schmidt process with the first $ vec(κ)_1 = [-1 -2 1 0] $ and second basis vectors $ vec(κ)_2 = [0 1 0 1] -proj{[0 1 0 1]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} = [0 1 0 1] -frac([0 1 0 1]dot product of [-1 -2 1 0]){ [-1 -2 1 0]dot product of [-1 -2 1 0]} ·[-1 -2 1 0] = [0 1 0 1] -(-2/6) ·[-1 -2 1 0] =[-1/3 1/3 1/3 1] $ and finish by normalizing. $ sequence{ [-1/√{6] -2/√{6} 1/√{6} 0}, [-√{3]/6 √{3}/6 √{3}/6 √{3}/2} } $   Show that any linearly independent subset of $ ℝ^n $ can be orthogonalized without changing its span.  A linearly independent subset of $ ℝ^n$ is a basis for its own span. Apply .  Remark. Here's why the phrase `linearly independent' is in the question. Dropping the phrase would require us to worry about two things. The first thing to worry about is that when we do the Gram-Schmidt process on a linearly dependent set then we get some zero vectors. For instance, with $ S={[1 2],[3 6]} $ we would get this. $ vec(κ)_1 = [1 2]  vec(κ)_2 = [3 6]-proj{[3 6]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} = [0 0] $ This first thing is not so bad because the zero vector is by definition orthogonal to every other vector, so we could accept this situation as yielding an orthogonal set (although it of course can't be normalized), or we just could modify the Gram-Schmidt procedure to throw out any zero vectors. The second thing to worry about if we drop the phrase `linearly independent' from the question is that the set might be infinite. Of course, any subspace of the finite-dimensional $ ℝ^n$ must also be finite-dimensional so only finitely many of its members are linearly independent, but nonetheless, a ``process'' that examines the vectors in an infinite set one at a time would at least require some more elaboration in this question. A linearly independent subset of $ ℝ^n$ is automatically finite- in fact, of size~$n$ or less- so the `linearly independent' phrase obviates these concerns.  What happens if we try to apply the Gram-Schmidt process to a finite set that is not a basis?  If that set is not linearly independent, then we get a zero vector. Otherwise (if our set is linearly independent but does not span the space), we are doing Gram-Schmidt on a set that is a basis for a subspace and so we get an orthogonal basis for a subspace.   What happens if we apply the Gram-Schmidt process to a basis that is already orthogonal?  The process leaves the basis unchanged.   Let $sequence{vec(κ)_1,...,vec(κ)_k}$ be a set of mutually orthogonal vectors in $ ℝ^n$.  Prove that for any $vec(v)$ in the space, the vector $vec(v)-(proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +...+proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(v)_k)})$ is orthogonal to each of $vec(κ)_1$, ..., $vec(κ)_k$. Illustrate the prior item in $ ℝ^3$ by using $vec(e)_1$ as $vec(κ)_1$, using $vec(e)_2$ as $vec(κ)_2$, and taking $vec(v)$ to have components $1$, $2$, and $3$. Show that $proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +...+proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(v)_k)}$ is the vector in the span of the set of $vec(κ)$'s that is closest to $vec(v)$. Hint. To the illustration done for the prior part, add a vector $d_1vec(κ)_1+d_2vec(κ)_2$ and apply the Pythagorean Theorem to the resulting triangle.    The argument is as in the $i=3$ case of the proof of . The dot product $ vec(κ)_idot product of (vec(v)-proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} -...-proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(v)_k)}) $ can be written as the sum of terms of the form $-vec(κ)_idot product of proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_j)}$ with $j ≠ i$, and the term $vec(κ)_idot product of (vec(v)- proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_i)})$. The first kind of term equals zero because the $vec(κ)$'s are mutually orthogonal. The other term is zero because this projection is orthogonal (that is, the projection definition makes it zero: $vec(κ)_idot product of (vec(v) -proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_i)}) =vec(κ)_idot product of vec(v)- vec(κ)_idot product of ((vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_i)/( vec(κ)_idot product of vec(κ)_i)) ·vec(κ)_i$ equals, after all of the cancellation is done, zero). The vector $vec(v)$ is in black and the vector $proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(v)_2)} =1·vec(e)_1+2·vec(e)_2$ is in gray.    The vector $vec(v)-(proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(v)_2)})$ lies on the dotted line connecting the black vector to the gray one, that is, it is orthogonal to the $xy$-plane. We get this diagram by following the hint.    The dashed triangle has a right angle where the gray vector $1·vec(e)_1+2·vec(e)_2$ meets the vertical dashed line $vec(v)-(1·vec(e)_1+2·vec(e)_2)$; this is what first item of this question proved. The Pythagorean theorem then gives that the hypotenuse- the segment from $vec(v)$ to any other vector- is longer than the vertical dashed line.  More formally, writing $proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +...+proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(v)_k)}$ as $c_1·vec(κ)_1+...+c_k·vec(κ)_k$, consider any other vector in the span $d_1·vec(κ)_1+...+d_k·vec(κ)_k$. Note that $ vec(v)-(d_1·vec(κ)_1+...+d_k·vec(κ)_k) $ = [(vec(v) -(c_1·vec(κ)_1+...+c_k·vec(κ)_k) ]) +[((c_1·vec(κ)_1+...+c_k·vec(κ)_k) -(d_1·vec(κ)_1+...+d_k·vec(κ)_k) ]) $ $ and that $ [(vec(v) -(c_1·vec(κ)_1+...+c_k·vec(κ)_k) ]) dot product of [((c_1·vec(κ)_1+...+c_k·vec(κ)_k) -(d_1·vec(κ)_1+...+d_k·vec(κ)_k) ]) =0 $ (because the first item shows the $vec(v) -(c_1·vec(κ)_1+...+c_k·vec(κ)_k)$ is orthogonal to each $vec(κ)$ and so it is orthogonal to this linear combination of the $vec(κ)$'s). Now apply the Pythagorean Theorem (i.e., the Triangle Inequality).    Find a nonzero vector in $ ℝ^3 $ that is orthogonal to both of these. $ [1 5 -1]  [2 2 0] $  One way to proceed is to find a third vector so that the three together make a basis for $ ℝ^3$, e.g., $ vec(β)_3=[1 0 0] $ (the second vector is not dependent on the third because it has a nonzero second component, and the first is not dependent on the second and third because of its nonzero third component), and then apply the Gram-Schmidt process. The first element of the new basis is this. $ vec(κ)_1 = [1 5 -1] $ And this is the second element. $ vec(κ)_2 = [2 2 0] -proj{[2 2 0]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} =[2 2 0] -frac([2 2 0]dot product of [1 5 -1]){ [1 5 -1]dot product of [1 5 -1]} ·[1 5 -1] = [2 2 0] -(12/27)·[1 5 -1] =[14/9 -2/9 4/9] $ Here is the final element. $ vec(κ)_3 = [1 0 0] -proj{[1 0 0]}{span(vec(κ)_1)} -proj{[1 0 0]}{span(vec(κ)_2)} = [1 0 0] -frac([1 0 0]dot product of [1 5 -1]){ [1 5 -1]dot product of [1 5 -1]} ·[1 5 -1] -frac([1 0 0]dot product of [14/9 -2/9 4/9]){ [14/9 -2/9 4/9]dot product of [14/9 -2/9 4/9]} ·[14/9 -2/9 4/9] = [1 0 0] -(1/27)·[1 5 -1] -(7/12)·[14/9 -2/9 4/9] =[1/18 -1/18 -4/18] $ The result $vec(κ)_3$ is orthogonal to both $vec(κ)_1$ and $vec(κ)_2$. It is therefore orthogonal to every vector in the span of the set ${vec{{κ}_1,vec{{κ}_2}$, including the two vectors given in the question.   One advantage of orthogonal bases is that they simplify finding the representation of a vector with respect to that basis.  For this vector and this non-orthogonal basis for $ ℝ^2$ $ vec(v)=[2 3]  B=sequence{[1 1], [1 0]} $ first represent the vector with respect to the basis. Then project the vector into the span of each basis vector $span(smash{vec(β)_1)}$ and $span(smash{vec(β)_2)}$. With this orthogonal basis for $ ℝ^2$ $ K=sequence{[1 1], [1 -1]} $ represent the same vector $vec(v)$ with respect to the basis. Then project the vector into the span of each basis vector. Note that the coefficients in the representation and the projection are the same. Let $K=sequence{vec(κ)_1,...,vec(κ)_k}$ be an orthogonal basis for some subspace of $ ℝ^n$. Prove that for any $vec(v)$ in the subspace, the $i$-th component of the representation $rep{vec(v)}{K}$ is the scalar coefficient $(vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_i)/ (vec(κ)_idot product of vec(κ)_i)$ from $proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_i)}$. Prove that $vec(v)=proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +...+proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_k)}$.    We can do the representation by eye. $ [2 3]=3·[1 1]+(-1)·[1 0]  rep{vec(v)}{B}=[3 -1]_B $ The two projections are also easy. $ proj{[2 3]}{span(vec(β)_1)} =frac([2 3]dot product of [1 1]){ [1 1]dot product of [1 1]} ·[1 1] =(5/2)·[1 1] proj{[2 3]}{span(vec(β)_2)} =frac([2 3]dot product of [1 0]){ [1 0]dot product of [1 0]} ·[1 0] =(2/1)·[1 0] $ As above, we can do the representation by eye $ [2 3]=(5/2)·[1 1] +(-1/2)·[1 -1] $ and the two projections are easy. $ proj{[2 3]}{span(vec(β)_1)} =frac([2 3]dot product of [1 1]){ [1 1]dot product of [1 1]} ·[1 1] =(5/2)·[1 1] proj{[2 3]}{span(vec(β)_2)} =frac([2 3]dot product of [1 -1]){ [1 -1]dot product of [1 -1]} ·[1 -1] =(-1/2)·[1 -1] $ Note the recurrence of the $5/2$ and the $-1/2$. Represent $vec(v)$ with respect to the basis $ rep{vec(v)}{K}=[r_1 ... r_k] $ so that $vec(v)=r_1vec(κ)_1+...+r_kvec(κ)_k$. To determine $r_i$, take the dot product of both sides with $vec(κ)_i$. $ vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_i =(r_1vec(κ)_1+...+r_kvec(κ)_k) dot product of vec(κ)_i =r_1· 0+...+r_i·(vec(κ)_idot product of vec(κ)_i) +...+r_k· 0 $ Solving for $r_i$ yields the desired coefficient. This is a restatement of the prior item.    Bessel's Inequality. Consider these orthonormal sets $ B_1={vec{{e}_1}  B_2={vec{{e}_1,vec{{e}_2}  B_3={vec{{e}_1,vec{{e}_2,vec{{e}_3}  B_4={vec{{e}_1,vec{{e}_2,vec{{e}_3,vec{{e}_4} $ along with the vector $vec(v) in ℝ^4$ whose components are $4$, $3$, $2$, and $1$.   Find the coefficient $c_1$ for the projection of $vec(v)$ into the span of the vector in $B_1$. Check that $norm{vec(v)}^2≥ |c_1|^2$.  Find the coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ for the projection of $vec(v)$ into the spans of the two vectors in $B_2$. Check that $norm{vec(v)}^2≥ |c_1|^2+|c_2|^2$. Find $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$ associated with the vectors in $B_3$, and $c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$, and $c_4$ for the vectors in $B_4$. Check that $norm{vec(v)}^2≥ |c_1|^2+...+|c_3|^2$ and that $norm{vec(v)}^2≥ |c_1|^2+...+|c_4|^2$.  Show that this holds in general:~where ${vec{{κ}_1,...,vec{{κ}_k}$ is an orthonormal set and $c_i$ is coefficient of the projection of a vector $vec(v)$ from the space then $norm{vec(v)}^2≥ |c_1|^2+...+|c_k|^2$. Hint.~~One way is to look at the inequality $0≤norm{vec(v)-(c_1vec(κ)_1+...+c_kvec(κ)_k)}^2$ and expand the $c$'s.  First, $norm{vec(v)}^2=4^2+3^2+2^2+1^2=50$.  $c_1=4$ $c_1=4$, $c_2=3$ $c_1=4$, $c_2=3$, $c_3=2$, $c_4=1$  For the proof, we will do only the $k=2$ case because the completely general case is messier but no more enlightening. We follow the hint (recall that for any vector $vec(w)$ we have $norm{vec(w)}^2=vec(w)dot product of vec(w)$). $ 0 ≤ (vec(v)-[(frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(κ)_1 +frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2} ·vec(κ)_2 ]) ) dot product of (vec(v)-[(frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(κ)_1 +frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2} ·vec(κ)_2 ]) ) =$[t] vec(v)dot product of vec(v) -2·vec(v) dot product of (frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(κ)_1 +frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2} ·vec(κ)_2) +(frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(κ)_1 +frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2} ·vec(κ)_2) dot product of (frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(κ)_1 +frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2} ·vec(κ)_2) $ = vec(v)dot product of vec(v) -2· (frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·(vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_1) +frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2} ·(vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_2)) +((frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1})^2 ·(vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1) +(frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2})^2 ·(vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2)) $ (The two mixed terms in the third part of the third line are zero because $vec(κ)_1$ and $vec(κ)_2$ are orthogonal.) The result now follows on gathering like terms and on recognizing that $vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1=1$ and $vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2=1$ because these vectors are members of an orthonormal set.   Prove or disprove:~every vector in $ ℝ^n $ is in some orthogonal basis.  It is true, except for the zero vector. Every vector in $ ℝ^n $ except the zero vector is in a basis, and that basis can be orthogonalized.   Show that the columns of an $ N by N $ matrix form an orthonormal set if and only if the inverse of the matrix is its transpose. Produce such a matrix.  The $N by N$ case gives the idea. The set $ {[a d g],[b e h],[c f i]} $ is orthonormal if and only if these nine conditions all hold $ $ [a d g]dot product of [a d g]=1 [a d g]dot product of [b e h]=0 [a d g]dot product of [c f i]=0 [b e h]dot product of [a d g]=0 [b e h]dot product of [b e h]=1 [b e h]dot product of [c f i]=0 [c f i]dot product of [a d g]=0 [c f i]dot product of [b e h]=0 [c f i]dot product of [c f i]=1 $ $ (the three conditions in the lower left are redundant but nonetheless correct). Those, in turn, hold if and only if $ ([ a d g b e h c f i ]) ([ a b c d e f g h i ]) = ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $ as required.  This is an example, the inverse of this matrix is its transpose. $ ([ 1/√{2} 1/√{2} 0 -1/√{2} 1/√{2} 0 0 0 1 ]) $   Does the proof of fail to consider the possibility that the set of vectors is empty (i.e., that $k=0$)?  If the set is empty then the summation on the left side is the linear combination of the empty set of vectors, which by definition adds to the zero vector. In the second sentence, there is not such $i$, so the `if ... then ...' implication is vacuously true.   describes a change of basis from any basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_k} $ to one that is orthogonal $ K=sequence{vec(κ)_1,...,vec(κ)_k} $. Consider the change of basis matrix $Representation of (I)$.  Prove that the matrix $Representation of (I)$ changing bases in the direction opposite to that of the theorem has an upper triangular shape- all of its entries below the main diagonal are zeros. Prove that the inverse of an upper triangular matrix is also upper triangular (if the matrix is invertible, that is). This shows that the matrix $Representation of (I)$ changing bases in the direction described in the theorem is upper triangular.    Part of the induction argument proving checks that $vec(κ)_i$ is in the span of $sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_i}$. (The $i=3$ case in the proof illustrates.) Thus, in the change of basis matrix $Representation of (I)$, the $i$-th column $rep{vec(κ)_i}{B}$ has components $i+1$ through $k$ that are zero. One way to see this is to recall the computational procedure that we use to find the inverse. We write the matrix, write the identity matrix next to it, and then we do Gauss-Jordan reduction. If the matrix starts out upper triangular then the Gauss-Jordan reduction involves only the Jordan half and these steps, when performed on the identity, will result in an upper triangular inverse matrix.    Complete the induction argument in the proof of .  For the inductive step, we assume that for all $j$ in~$[1..i]$, these three conditions are true of each $vec(κ)_j$: (i)~each $vec(κ)_j$ is nonzero, (ii)~each $vec(κ)_j$ is a linear combination of the vectors $vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_j$, and (iii)~each $vec(κ)_j$ is orthogonal to all of the $vec(κ)_m$'s prior to it (that is, with $m<j$). With those inductive hypotheses, consider $vec(κ)_{i+1}$. $ vec(κ)_{i+1} = vec(β)_{i+1} -proj{β_{i+1}}{span(vec(κ)_1)} -proj{β_{i+1}}{span(vec(κ)_2)} -... -proj{β_{i+1}}{span(vec(κ)_i)} = vec(β)_{i+1} -frac{β_{i+1}dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(κ)_1 -frac{β_{i+1}dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2} ·vec(κ)_2 -... -frac{β_{i+1}dot product of vec(κ)_i}{ vec(κ)_idot product of vec(κ)_i} ·vec(κ)_i $ By the inductive assumption~(ii) we can expand each $vec(κ)_j$ into a linear combination of $vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_j$ $ = vec(β)_{i+1} -frac{vec(β)_{i+1}dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(β)_1 -frac{vec(β)_{i+1}dot product of vec(κ)_2}{ vec(κ)_2dot product of vec(κ)_2} · (text{ linear combination of $vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2$} ) -·s -frac{vec(β)_{i+1}dot product of vec(κ)_i}{ vec(κ)_idot product of vec(κ)_i} · (text{ linear combination of $vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_i$} ) $ The fractions are scalars so this is a linear combination of linear combinations of $vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_{i+1}$. It is therefore just a linear combination of $vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_{i+1}$. Now, (i)~it cannot sum to the zero vector because the equation would then describe a nontrivial linear relationship among the $vec(β)$'s that are given as members of a basis (the relationship is nontrivial because the coefficient of $vec(β)_{i+1}$ is $1$). Also, (ii)~the equation gives $vec(κ)_{i+1}$ as a combination of $vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_{i+1}$. Finally, for~(iii), consider $vec(κ)_jdot product of vec(κ)_{i+1}$; as in the $i=3$ case, the dot product of $vec(κ)_j$ with $vec(κ)_{i+1}=vec(β)_{i+1} -proj{vec(β)_{i+1}}{span(vec(κ)_1)} -... -proj{vec(β)_{i+1}}{span(vec(κ)_i)}$ can be rewritten to give two kinds of terms, $vec(κ)_jdot product of (vec(β)_{i+1} -proj{vec(β)_{i+1}}{span(vec(κ)_j)} )$ (which is zero because the projection is orthogonal) and $vec(κ)_jdot product of proj{vec(β)_{i+1}}{span(vec(κ)_m)}$ with $m ≠ j$ and $m<i+1$ (which is zero because by the hypothesis~(iii) the vectors $vec(κ)_j$ and $vec(κ)_m$ are orthogonal).                        textit{This subsection uses material from the optional earlier subsection on Combining Subspaces.}  The prior subsections project a vector into a line by decomposing it into two parts:~the part in the line $proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(s))}$ and the rest $vec(v)-proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(s))}$. To generalize projection to arbitrary subspaces we will follow this decomposition idea.    Let a vector space be a direct sum $ V=M⊕ N $. Then for any $ vec(v) in V $ with $vec(v)=vec(m)+vec(n)$ where $ vec(m) in M,vec(n) in N $, the definend{projection of $ vec(v) $ into $ M $ along $ N $}  is $proj{vec(v)}{M,N}=vec(m)$.   This definition applies in spaces where we don't have a ready definition of orthogonal. (Definitions of orthogonality for spaces other than the $ ℝ^n$ are perfectly possible but we haven't seen any in this book.)  For example The space $ matspace(_){N by N} $ of $N by N$ matrices is the direct sum of these two. $ M={([ a b 0 0 ]) such that a,b in ℝ }  N={([ 0 0 c d ]) such that c,d in ℝ } $ To project $ A=([ 3 1 0 4 ]) $ into $M$ along $N$, we first fix bases for the two subspaces. $ B_{M}=sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 1 0 0 ]) }  B_{N}=sequence{ ([ 0 0 1 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } $ Their concatenation $ B=cat{B_{M}}{B_{N}}=sequence{ ([ 1 0 0 0 ]), ([ 0 1 0 0 ]), ([ 0 0 1 0 ]), ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) } $ is a basis for the entire space because $ matspace(_){N by N} $ is the direct sum. So we can use it to represent $A$. $ ([ 3 1 0 4 ])= 3·([ 1 0 0 0 ]) +1·([ 0 1 0 0 ]) +0·([ 0 0 1 0 ]) +4·([ 0 0 0 1 ]) $ The projection of $A$ into $M$ along $N$ keeps the $M$ part and drops the $N$ part. $ proj{([ 3 1 0 4 ]) }{M,N} = 3·([ 1 0 0 0 ]) +1·([ 0 1 0 0 ]) =([ 3 1 0 0 ]) $   For example Both subscripts on $proj{vec(v)}{M,N}$ are significant. The first subscript $M$ matters because the result of the projection is a member of $M$. For an example showing that the second one matters, fix this plane subspace of $ ℝ^3$ and its basis. $ M={[x y z] such that y-2z=0}  B_M=sequence{ [1 0 0], [0 2 1] } $ We will compare the projections of this element of~$ ℝ^3$ $ vec(v)=[2 2 5] $ into $M$ along these two subspaces (verification that $ ℝ^3=M⊕ N $ and $ ℝ^3=M⊕ N̂ $ is routine). $ N={k[0 0 1] such that k in ℝ}  N̂={k[0 1 -2] such that k in ℝ} $ Here are natural bases for $N$ and $N̂$. $ B_N=sequence{ [0 0 1] }  B_{N̂}=sequence{ [0 1 -2] } $ To project into $M$ along~$N$, represent $vec(v)$ with respect to the concatenation $B_M{B_N}$ $ [2 2 5]= 2·[1 0 0]+ 1·[0 2 1]+ 4·[0 0 1] $ and drop the $N$ term. $ proj{vec(v)}{M,N} =2·[1 0 0]+ 1·[0 2 1] =[2 2 1] $ To project into~$M$ along~$N̂$ represent $vec(v)$ with respect to $B_M{B_{N̂}}$ $ [2 2 5]= 2·[1 0 0] +(9/5)·[0 2 1] -(8/5)·[0 1 -2] $ and omit the $N̂$ part. $ proj{vec(v)}{M,N̂} = 2·[1 0 0] +(9/5)·[0 2 1] =[2 18/5 9/5] $ So projecting along different subspaces can give different results.  These pictures compare the two maps. Both show that the projection is indeed `into' the plane and `along' the line.      Notice that the projection along $N$ is not orthogonal since there are members of the plane $M$ that are not orthogonal to the dotted line. But the projection along $N̂$ is orthogonal.   We have seen two projection operations, orthogonal projection into a line as well as this subsections's projection into an~$M$ and along an~$N$, and we naturally ask whether they are related. The right-hand picture above suggests the answer- orthogonal projection into a line is a special case of this subsection's projection; it is projection along a subspace perpendicular to the line.         The orthogonal complement  of a subspace $ M $ of $ ℝ^n$ is $ M^perp={vec{{v} in ℝ^n such that vec(v) is perpendicular to all vectors in M} $ (read ``$ M $ perp''). The orthogonal projection $ proj{vec(v)}{M} $ of a vector is its projection into $M$ along $ M^perp$.    For example In $ ℝ^3 $, to find the orthogonal complement of the plane $ P={[x y z] such that 3x+2y-z=0 } $ we start with a basis for $ P $. $ B=sequence{[1 0 3], [0 1 2] } $ Any $ vec(v) $ perpendicular to every vector in $B$ is perpendicular to every vector in the span of $B$ (the proof of this is ). Therefore, the subspace $P^perp$ consists of the vectors that satisfy these two conditions. $ [1 0 3]dot product of [v_1 v_2 v_3]=0  [0 1 2]dot product of [v_1 v_2 v_3]=0 $ Those conditions give a linear system. $ P^perp ={[v_1 v_2 v_3] such that ([ 1 0 3 0 1 2 ]) [v_1 v_2 v_3] =[0 0] } $ We are thus left with finding the null space of the map represented by the matrix, that is, with calculating the solution set of the homogeneous linear system. $ $ v_1 + 3v_3 = 0 v_2 + 2v_3 = 0 $ --> P^perp={k[-3 -2 1] such that k in ℝ} $      For example Where $ M $ is the $ xy $-plane subspace of $ ℝ^3 $, what is $ M^perp$? A common first reaction is that $ M^perp$ is the $ yz $-plane but that's not right because some vectors from the $ yz $-plane are not perpendicular to every vector in the $ xy $-plane.  { $[1 1 0] not perp[0 3 2]$}    { $ θ=arccos(frac(1· 0+1· 3+0· 2){ √{2}·√{13}}) ≈$0.94$~rad$}  Instead $ M^perp$ is the $ z $-axis, since proceeding as in the prior example and taking the natural basis for the $xy$-plane gives this. $ M^perp = {[x y z] such that ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) [x y z]= [0 0] } = {[x y z] such that x=0 { and y=0 } $        If $M$ is a subspace of $ ℝ^n$ then its orthogonal complement $M^perp$ is also a subspace. The space is the direct sum of the two $ ℝ^n=M⊕ M^perp$. And, for any $vec(v) in ℝ^n$ the vector $vec(v)-proj{vec(v)}{M}$ is perpendicular to every vector in $M$.    First, the orthogonal complement $M^perp$ is a subspace of $ ℝ^n$ because, as noted in the prior two examples, it is a null space.  Next, to show that the space is the direct sum of the two, start with any basis $ B_M=sequence{vec(μ)_1,...,vec(μ)_k} $ for $ M $ and expand it to a basis   for the entire space. Apply the Gram-Schmidt process to get an orthogonal basis $ K=sequence{vec(κ)_1,...,vec(κ)_n} $ for $ ℝ^n $. This $K$ is the concatenation of two bases: $ sequence{vec(κ)_1,...,vec(κ)_k} $ with the same number of members~$k$ as $B_M$, and $ sequence{vec(κ)_{k+1},...,vec(κ)_n} $. The first is a basis for $M$ so if we show that the second is a basis for $ M^perp$ then we will have that the entire space is the direct sum.  from the prior subsection proves this about any orthogonal basis:~each vector $vec(v)$ in the space is the sum of its orthogonal projections into the lines spanned by the basis vectors. $ vec(v)=proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +...+proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_n)} $ To check this, represent the vector as $vec(v)=r_1vec(κ)_1+...+r_nvec(κ)_n$, apply $vec(κ)_i$ to both sides $ vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_i =(r_1vec(κ)_1+...+r_nvec(κ)_n) dot product of vec(κ)_i =r_1· 0+...+r_i·(vec(κ)_idot product of vec(κ)_i) +...+r_n· 0 $, and solve to get $r_i=(vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_i)/(vec(κ)_idot product of vec(κ)_i)$, as desired.  Since obviously any member of the span of $ sequence{vec(κ)_{k+1},...,vec(κ)_n} $ is orthogonal to any vector in $M$, to show that this is a basis for $M^perp$ we need only show the other containment- that any $vec(w) in M^perp$ is in the span of this basis. The prior paragraph does this. Any $vec(w) in M^perp$ gives this on projections into basis vectors from $M$: $proj{vec(w)}{span(vec(κ)_1)}=0, ...,proj{vec(w)}{span(vec(κ)_k)}=0$. Therefore equation~($*$) gives that $vec(w)$ is a linear combination of $ vec(κ)_{k+1},...,vec(κ)_n $. Thus this is a basis for $M^perp$ and $ ℝ^n$ is the direct sum of the two.  The final sentence of the lemma is proved in much the same way. Write $vec(v)=proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +...+proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_n)}$. Then $proj{vec(v)}{M}$ keeps only the $M$ part and drops the $M^perp$ part $proj{vec(v)}{M}=proj{vec(v)}{span(vec{κ)_{k+1}}} +...+proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_k)}$. Therefore $vec(v)-proj{vec(v)}{M}$ consists of a linear combination of elements of $M^perp$ and so is perpendicular to every vector in $M$.   Given a subspace, we could compute the orthogonal projection into that subspace by following the steps of that proof: finding a basis, expanding it to a basis for the entire space, applying Gram-Schmidt to get an orthogonal basis, and projecting into each linear subspace. However we will instead use a convenient formula.   Let $ M $ be a subspace of $ ℝ^n $ with basis $ sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_k} $ and let $ A $ be the matrix whose columns are the $ vec(β) $'s. Then for any $vec(v) in ℝ^n$ the orthogonal projection is $proj{vec(v)}{M}=c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_kvec(β)_k$, where the coefficients $c_i$ are the entries of the vector $(AᵀA)^{-1}Aᵀ·vec(v)$. That is, $proj{vec(v)}{M}=A(AᵀA)^{-1}Aᵀ·vec(v)$.    The vector $ proj{vec(v)}{M} $ is a member of $ M $ and so is a linear combination of basis vectors $ c_1·vec(β)_1+...+c_k·vec(β)_k $. Since $A$'s columns are the $vec(β)$'s, there is a $ vec(in) ℝ^k $ such that $ proj{vec(v)}{M}=Avec$.    To find $vec$ note that the vector $ vec(v)-proj{vec(v)}{M} $ is perpendicular to each member of the basis so  $ 0 =Aᵀ[( vec(v)-Avec]) =Aᵀvec(v)-AᵀAvec $ and solving gives this (showing that $ AᵀA $ is invertible is an exercise). $ vec=[( AᵀA])^{-1}Aᵀ·vec(v) $ Therefore $proj{vec(v)}{M}=A·vec=A(AᵀA)^{-1}Aᵀ·vec(v)$, as required.   For example To orthogonally project this vector into this subspace $ vec(v)=[1 -1 1]  P={[x y z] such that x+z=0} $ first make a matrix whose columns are a basis for the subspace $ A=([ 0 1 1 0 0 -1 ]) $ and then compute. $ A[(AᵀA])^{-1}Aᵀ =([ 0 1 1 0 0 -1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 1/2 ]) ([ 0 1 0 1 0 -1 ]) = ([ 1/2 0 -1/2 0 1 0 -1/2 0 1/2 ]) $ With the matrix, calculating the orthogonal projection of any vector into $P$ is easy. $ proj{vec(v)}{P}= ([ 1/2 0 -1/2 0 1 0 -1/2 0 1/2 ]) [1 -1 1] =[0 -1 0] $ Note, as a check, that this result is indeed in $P$.     Project the vectors into $ M $ along $ N $.  $ [3 -2], M={[x y] such that x+y=0}, N={[x y] such that -x-2y=0} $ $ [1 2], M={[x y] such that x-y=0}, N={[x y] such that 2x+y=0} $ $ [3 0 1], M={[x y z] such that x+y=0}, N={c·[1 0 1] such that c in ℝ} $    When bases for the subspaces $ B_M=[1 -1]  B_N=[2 -1] $ are concatenated $ B=B_M{B_N}=sequence{[1 -1], [2 -1]} $ and the given vector is represented $ [3 -2]=1·[1 -1]+1·[2 -1] $ then the answer comes from retaining the $M$~part and dropping the $N$~part. $ proj{[3 -2]}{M,N} =[1 -1] $ When the bases $ B_M=[1 1]  B_N[1 -2] $ are concatenated, and the vector is represented, $ [1 2] =(4/3)·[1 1] -(1/3)·[1 -2] $ then retaining only the $M$~part gives this answer. $ proj{[1 2]}{M,N}=[4/3 4/3] $ With these bases $ B_M=sequence{[1 -1 0], [0 0 1]}  B_N=[1 0 1] $ the representation with respect to the concatenation is this. $ [3 0 1] =0·[1 -1 0] -2·[0 0 1] +3·[1 0 1] $ and so the projection is this. $ proj{[3 0 1]}{M,N}=[0 0 -2] $    Find $ M^perp$.  $ M={[x y] such that x+y=0 } $ $ M={[x y] such that -2x+3y=0 } $ $ M={[x y] such that x-y=0 } $ $ M={0} $ $ M={[x y] such that x=0 } $ $ M={[x y z] such that -x+3y+z=0 } $ $ M={[x y z] such that $x=0$ and $y+z=0$ } $   As in , we can simplify the calculation by just finding the space of vectors perpendicular to all the the vectors in $M$'s basis.  Parametrizing to get $ M={c·[-1 1] such that c in ℝ} $ gives that $ M^perp {[u v] such that 0=[u v]dot product of [-1 1]} ={[u v] such that 0=-u+v} $ Parametrizing the one-equation linear system gives this description. $ M^perp={k·[1 1] such that k in ℝ} $ As in the answer to the prior part, we can describe $M$ as a span $ M={c·[3/2 1] such that c in ℝ}  B_M=[3/2 1] $ and then $M^perp$ is the set of vectors perpendicular to the one vector in this basis. $ M^perp ={[u v] such that (3/2)· u+1· v=0} ={k·[-2/3 1] such that k in ℝ} $ Parametrizing the linear requirement in the description of $M$ gives this basis. $ M={c·[1 1] such that c in ℝ}  B_M=[1 1] $ Now, $M^perp$ is the set of vectors perpendicular to (the one vector in) $B_M$. $ M^perp ={[u v] such that u+v=0} ={k·[-1 1] such that k in ℝ} $ (By the way, this answer checks with the first item in this question.) Every vector in the space is perpendicular to the zero vector so $M^perp= ℝ^n$. The appropriate description and basis for $M$ are routine. $ M={y·[0 1] such that y in ℝ}  B_M=[0 1] $ Then $ M^perp ={[u v] such that 0· u+1· v=0} ={k·[1 0] such that k in ℝ} $ and so $($y$-axis)^perp=$x$-axis$. The description of $M$ is easy to find by parametrizing. $ M={c·[3 1 0] +d·[1 0 1] such that c,d in ℝ}  B_M=[3 1 0],[1 0 1] $ Finding $M^perp$ here just requires solving a linear system with two equations $ $ 3u + v = 0 u + w = 0 $ for step $-(1/3)ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ 3u + v = 0 -(1/3)v + w = 0 $ $ and parametrizing. $ M^perp ={k·[-1 3 1] such that k in ℝ} $ Here, $M$ is one-dimensional $ M={c·[0 -1 1] such that c in ℝ}  B_M=[0 -1 1] $ and as a result, $M^perp$ is two-dimensional. $ M^perp ={[u v w] such that 0· u-1· v+1· w=0} ={j·[1 0 0] +k·[0 1 1] such that j,k in ℝ} $    This subsection shows how to project orthogonally in two ways, the method of and~, and the method of . To compare them, consider the plane $P$ specified by $3x+2y-z=0$ in $ ℝ^3$.  Find a basis for $P$. Find $P^perp$ and a basis for $P^perp$. Represent this vector with respect to the concatenation of the two bases from the prior item. $ vec(v)=[1 1 2] $ Find the orthogonal projection of $vec(v)$ into $P$ by keeping only the $P$ part from the prior item. Check that against the result from applying .    Parametrizing the equation leads to this basis for $P$. $ B_P=sequence{[1 0 3], [0 1 2] } $ Because $ ℝ^3$ is three-dimensional and $P$ is two-dimensional, the complement $P^perp$ must be a line. Anyway, the calculation as in $ P^perp={[x y z] such that ([ 1 0 3 0 1 2 ]) [x y z] =[0 0]} $ gives this basis for $P^perp$. $ B_{P^perp}=[3 2 -1] $ $ [1 1 2]= (5/14)·[1 0 3]+ (8/14)·[0 1 2]+ (3/14)·[3 2 -1]$ $proj{[1 1 2]}{P} =[5/14 8/14 31/14]$ The matrix of the projection $ ([ 1 0 0 1 3 2 ]) [( ([ 1 0 3 0 1 2 ]) ([ 1 0 0 1 3 2 ]) ])^{-1} ([ 1 0 3 0 1 2 ]) $ = ([ 1 0 0 1 3 2 ]) ([ 10 6 6 5 ])^{-1} ([ 1 0 3 0 1 2 ]) = (1/14) ([ 5 -6 3 -6 10 2 3 2 13 ]) $ $ when applied to the vector, yields the expected result. $ (1/14) ([ 5 -6 3 -6 10 2 3 2 13 ]) [1 1 2] =[5/14 8/14 31/14] $    We have three ways to find the orthogonal projection of a vector into a line, the def:ProjIntoLine way from the first subsection of this section, the and~ way of representing the vector with respect to a basis for the space and then keeping the $M$~part, and the way of . For these cases, do all three ways.  $ vec(v)=[1 -3], M={[x y] such that x+y=0} $ $ vec(v)=[0 1 2], M={[x y z] such that $x+z=0$ and $y=0$} $    Parametrizing gives this. $ M={c·[-1 1] such that c in ℝ} $  For the first way, we take the vector spanning the line $M$ to be $ vec(s)=[-1 1] $ and the def:ProjIntoLine formula gives this. $ proj{[1 -3]}{span(vec(s))} =frac([1 -3]dot product of [-1 1]){ [-1 1]dot product of [-1 1]} ·[-1 1] =(-4/2) ·[-1 1] =[2 -2] $  For the second way, we fix $ B_M=[-1 1] $ and so (as in and~, we can just find the vectors perpendicular to all of the members of the basis) $ M^perp ={[u v] such that -1· u+1· v=0} ={k·[1 1] such that k in ℝ}  B_{M^perp}=[1 1] $ and representing the vector with respect to the concatenation gives this. $ [1 -3]=-2·[-1 1]-1·[1 1] $ Keeping the $M$~part yields the answer. $ proj{[1 -3]}{M,M^perp}=[2 -2] $  The third part is also a simple calculation (there is a $N by N$ matrix in the middle, and the inverse of it is also $N by N$) $ A(AᵀA)^{-1}Aᵀ $ = ([ -1 1 ]) ( ([ -1 1 ]) ([ -1 1 ]) )^{-1} ([ -1 1 ]) = ([ -1 1 ]) ([ 2 ])^{-1} ([ -1 1 ]) = ([ -1 1 ]) ([ 1/2 ]) ([ -1 1 ]) = ([ -1 1 ]) ([ -1/2 1/2 ]) = ([ 1/2 -1/2 -1/2 1/2 ]) $ $ which of course gives the same answer. $ proj{[1 -3]}{M} = ([ 1/2 -1/2 -1/2 1/2 ]) [1 -3] =[2 -2] $ Parametrization gives this. $ M={c·[-1 0 1] such that c in ℝ} $ With that, the formula for the first way gives this. $ frac([0 1 2]dot product of [-1 0 1]){ [-1 0 1]dot product of [-1 0 1]} ·[-1 0 1] =(2/2) ·[-1 0 1] =[-1 0 1] $ To proceed by the second method we find $M^perp$, $ M^perp ={[u v w] such that -u+w=0} ={j·[1 0 1] +k·[0 1 0] such that j,k in ℝ} $ find the representation of the given vector with respect to the concatenation of the bases $B_M$ and $B_{M^perp}$ $ [0 1 2] =1·[-1 0 1] +1·[1 0 1] +1·[0 1 0] $ and retain only the $M$~part. $ proj{[0 1 2]}{M}=1·[-1 0 1] =[-1 0 1] $ Finally, for the third method, the matrix calculation $ A(AᵀA)^{-1}Aᵀ $ = ([ -1 0 1 ]) [( ([ -1 0 1 ]) ([ -1 0 1 ]) ])^{-1} ([ -1 0 1 ]) = ([ -1 0 1 ]) ([ 2 ])^{-1} ([ -1 0 1 ]) = ([ -1 0 1 ]) ([ 1/2 ]) ([ -1 0 1 ]) = ([ -1 0 1 ]) ([ -1/2 0 1/2 ]) = ([ 1/2 0 -1/2 0 0 0 -1/2 0 1/2 ]) $ $ followed by matrix-vector multiplication $ proj{[0 1 2]}{M} ([ 1/2 0 -1/2 0 0 0 -1/2 0 1/2 ]) [0 1 2] =[-1 0 1] $ gives the answer.    Check that the operation of def:ProjIntoMAlongN is well-defined. That is, in and~, doesn't the answer depend on the choice of bases?  No, a decomposition of vectors $vec(v)=vec(m)+vec(n)$ into $vec(m) in M$ and $vec(n) in N$ does not depend on the bases chosen for the subspaces, as we showed in the Direct Sum subsection.   What is the orthogonal projection into the trivial subspace?  The orthogonal projection of a vector into a subspace is a member of that subspace. Since a trivial subspace has only one member, $0$, the projection of any vector must equal $0$.   What is the projection of $ vec(v) $ into $ M $ along $ N $ if $ vec(v) in M $?  The projection into $M$ along $N$ of a $vec(v) in M$ is $vec(v)$. Decomposing $vec(v)=vec(m)+vec(n)$ gives $vec(m)=vec(v)$ and $vec(n)=0$, and dropping the $N$~part but retaining the $M$~part results in a projection of $vec(m)=vec(v)$.   Show that if $ M⊆ ℝ^n $ is a subspace with orthonormal basis $ basis(κ){n} $ then the orthogonal projection of $ vec(v) $ into $ M $ is this. $ (vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_1)·vec(κ)_1+ ...+ (vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_n)·vec(κ)_n $  The proof of shows that each vector $vec(v) in ℝ^n$ is the sum of its orthogonal projections into the lines spanned by the basis vectors. $ vec(v)=proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +...+proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_n)} =frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_1}{ vec(κ)_1dot product of vec(κ)_1} ·vec(κ)_1 +... +frac{vec(v)dot product of vec(κ)_n}{ vec(κ)_ndot product of vec(κ)_n} ·vec(κ)_n $ Since the basis is orthonormal, the bottom of each fraction has $vec(κ)_idot product of vec(κ)_i=1$.   Prove that the map $ p: V → V $ is the projection into $ M $ along $ N $ if and only if the map $ I-p $ is the projection into $ N $ along $ M $. (Recall the definition of the difference of two maps:~$(I-p)(vec(v))=I(vec(v))-p(vec(v)) =vec(v)-p(vec(v))$.)  If $V=M⊕ N$ then every vector decomposes uniquely as $vec(v)=vec(m)+vec(n)$. For all $vec(v)$ the map $p$ gives $p(vec(v))=vec(m)$ if and only if $vec(v)-p(vec(v))=vec(n)$, as required.   Show that if a vector is perpendicular to every vector in a set then it is perpendicular to every vector in the span of that set.  Let $vec(v)$ be perpendicular to every $vec(w) in S$. Then $vec(v)dot product of (c_1vec(w)_1+...+c_nvec(w)_n) =vec(v)dot product of (c_1vec(w)_1) +...+vec(v)dot product of (c_ndot product of vec(w)_n) =c_1(vec(v)dot product of vec(w)_1) +...+c_n(vec(v)dot product of vec(w)_n) =c_1· 0+...+c_n· 0=0$.   True or false:~the intersection of a subspace and its orthogonal complement is trivial.  True; the only vector orthogonal to itself is the zero vector.   Show that the dimensions of orthogonal complements add to the dimension of the entire space.  This is immediate from the statement in that the space is the direct sum of the two.   Suppose that $ vec(v)_1,vec(v)_2 in ℝ^n $ are such that for all complements $ M,N⊆ ℝ^n $, the projections of $ vec(v)_1 $ and $ vec(v)_2 $ into $ M $ along $ N $ are equal. Must $ vec(v)_1 $ equal $ vec(v)_2 $? (If so, what if we relax the condition to:~all orthogonal projections of the two are equal?)  The two must be equal, even only under the seemingly weaker condition that they yield the same result on all orthogonal projections. Consider the subspace $M$ spanned by the set ${vec{{v}_1,vec{{v}_2}$. Since each is in $M$, the orthogonal projection of $vec(v)_1$ into $M$ is $vec(v)_1$ and the orthogonal projection of $vec(v)_2$ into $M$ is $vec(v)_2$. For their projections into $M$ to be equal, they must be equal.   Let $ M,N $ be subspaces of $ ℝ^n $. The perp operator acts on subspaces; we can ask how it interacts with other such operations.  Show that two perps cancel: $ (M^perp)^perp=M $.  Prove that $ M⊆ N $ implies that $ N^perp⊆ M^perp$. Show that $ (M+N)^perp=M^perp(intersection) N^perp$.      We will show that the sets are mutually inclusive, $M⊆ (M^perp)^perp$ and $(M^perp)^perp⊆ M$. For the first, if $vec(m) in M$ then by the definition of the perp operation, $vec(m)$ is perpendicular to every $vec(v) in M^perp$, and therefore (again by the definition of the perp operation) $vec(m) in (M^perp)^perp$. For the other direction, consider $vec(v) in (M^perp)^perp$. 's proof shows that $ ℝ^n=M⊕ M^perp$ and that we can give an orthogonal basis for the space $sequence{vec(κ)_1,...,vec(κ)_k, vec(κ)_{k+1},...,vec(κ)_n}$ such that the first half $sequence{vec(κ)_1,...,vec(κ)_k}$ is a basis for $M$ and the second half is a basis for $M^perp$. The proof also checks that each vector in the space is the sum of its orthogonal projections into the lines spanned by these basis vectors. $ vec(v)=proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +...+proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_n)} $ Because $vec(v) in (M^perp)^perp$, it is perpendicular to every vector in $M^perp$, and so the projections in the second half are all zero. Thus $vec(v)=proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_1)} +...+proj{vec(v)}{span(vec(κ)_k)}$, which is a linear combination of vectors from $M$, and so $vec(v) in M$. (Remark. Here is a slicker way to do the second half:~write the space both as $M⊕ M^perp$ and as $M^perp⊕ (M^perp)^perp$. Because the first half showed that $M⊆ (M^perp)^perp$ and the prior sentence shows that the dimension of the two subspaces $M$ and $(M^perp)^perp$ are equal, we can conclude that $M$ equals $(M^perp)^perp$.) Because $M⊆ N$, any $vec(v)$ that is perpendicular to every vector in $N$ is also perpendicular to every vector in $M$. But that sentence simply says that $N^perp⊆ M^perp$. We will again show that the sets are equal by mutual inclusion. The first direction is easy; any $vec(v)$ perpendicular to every vector in $M+N={vec{{m}+vec{{n} such that vec{{m} in M, vec{{n} in N}$ is perpendicular to every vector of the form $vec(m)+0$ (that is, every vector in $M$) and every vector of the form $0+vec(n)$ (every vector in $N$), and so $(M+N)^perp⊆ M^perp(intersection) N^perp$. The second direction is also routine; any vector $vec(v) in M^perp(intersection) N^perp$ is perpendicular to any vector of the form $cvec(m)+dvec(n)$ because $vec(v)dot product of (cvec(m)+dvec(n)) =c·(vec(v)dot product of vec(m))+d·(vec(v)dot product of vec(n)) =c· 0+d· 0 =0$.    The material in this subsection allows us to express a geometric relationship that we have not yet seen between the range space and the null space of a linear map.  Represent $f: ℝ^3 → ℝ$ given by $ [v_1 v_2 v_3] ↦ 1v_1+2v_2+ 3v_3 $ with respect to the standard bases and show that $ [1 2 3] $ is a member of the perp of the null space. Prove that $νllspace{f}^perp$ is equal to the span of this vector. Generalize that to apply to any $f: ℝ^n → ℝ$. Represent $f: ℝ^3 → ℝ^2$ $ [v_1 v_2 v_3] ↦ colvec{1v_1+2v_2+ 3v_3 4v_1+5v_2+ 6v_3} $ with respect to the standard bases and show that $ [1 2 3], [4 5 6] $ are both members of the perp of the null space. Prove that $νllspace{f}^perp$ is the span of these two. (Hint. See the third item of .) Generalize that to apply to any $f: ℝ^n → ℝ^m$.  In this is called the Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra    The representation of $ [v_1 v_2 v_3] f ↓ 1v_1+2v_2+ 3v_3 $ is this. $ Representation of (f) =([ 1 2 3 ]) $ By the definition of $f$ $ νllspace{f} ={[v_1 v_2 v_3] such that 1v_1+2v_2+3v_3=0} ={[v_1 v_2 v_3] such that [1 2 3]dot product of [v_1 v_2 v_3]=0} $ and this second description exactly says this. $ νllspace{f}^perp =span({[1 2 3])} $ The generalization is that for any $f: ℝ^n → ℝ$ there is a vector $vec(h)$ so that $ [v_1 ... v_n] f ↓ h_1v_1+...+h_nv_n $ and $vec(h) inνllspace{f}^perp$. We can prove this by, as in the prior item, representing $f$ with respect to the standard bases and taking $vec(h)$ to be the column vector gotten by transposing the one row of that matrix representation. Of course, $ Representation of (f) = ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]) $ and so the null space is this set. $ νllspace{f} {[v_1 v_2 v_3] such that ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]) [v_1 v_2 v_3] =[0 0]} $ That description makes clear that $ [1 2 3], [4 5 6] inνllspace{f}^perp $ and since $νllspace{f}^perp$ is a subspace of $ ℝ^n$, the span of the two vectors is a subspace of the perp of the null space. To see that this containment is an equality, take $ M=span({[1 2 3])}  N=span({[4 5 6])} $ in the third item of , as suggested in the hint. As above, generalizing from the specific case is easy:~for any $f: ℝ^n → ℝ^m$ the matrix $H$ representing the map with respect to the standard bases describes the action $ [v_1 ... v_n] f ↓ [h_{1,1]v_1+h_{1,2}v_2+...+h_{1,n}v_n ... h_{m,1}v_1+h_{m,2}v_2+...+h_{m,n}v_n} $ and the description of the null space gives that on transposing the $m$~rows of $H$ $ vec(h)_1=[h_{1,1] h_{1,2} ... h_{1,n}}, ... vec(h)_m=[h_{m,1] h_{m,2} ... h_{m,n}} $ we have $νllspace{f}^perp =span({vec{{h)_1,...,vec{{h}_m}}$. ( describes this space as the transpose of the row space of $H$.)    Define a projection to be a linear transformation $ t: V → V $ with the property that repeating the projection does nothing more than does the projection alone:~$ (∘{t}{t})(vec(v))=t(vec(v)) $ for all $ vec(v) in V $.  Show that orthogonal projection into a line has that property. Show that projection along a subspace has that property. Show that for any such $t$ there is a basis $ B=basis(β){n} $ for $ V $ such that $ t(vec(β)_i)= begin(cases) vec(β)_i i=1,2,...,r 0 i=r+1,r+2,...,n end(cases) $ where $ r $ is the rank of $ t $. Conclude that every projection is a projection along a subspace. Also conclude that every projection has a representation $ Representation of (t)= ([ I Z Z Z ]) $ in block partial-identity form.    First note that if a vector $vec(v)$ is already in the line then the orthogonal projection gives $vec(v)$ itself. One way to verify this is to apply the formula for projection into the line spanned by a vector $vec(s)$, namely $(vec(v)dot product of vec(s)/vec(s)dot product of vec(s))·vec(s)$. Taking the line as ${k·vec{{v} such that k in ℝ}$ (the $vec(v)=0$ case is separate but easy) gives $(vec(v)dot product of vec(v)/vec(v)dot product of vec(v))·vec(v)$, which simplifies to $vec(v)$, as required.  Now, that answers the question because after once projecting into the line, the result $proj{vec(v)}$ is in that line. The prior paragraph says that projecting into the same line again will have no effect. The argument here is similar to the one in the prior item. With $V=M⊕ N$, the projection of $vec(v)=vec(m)+vec(n)$ is $proj{vec(v)}{M,N}=vec(m)$. Now repeating the projection will give $proj{vec(m)}{M,N}=vec(m)$, as required, because the decomposition of a member of $M$ into the sum of a member of $M$ and a member of $N$ is $vec(m)=vec(m)+0$. Thus, projecting twice into $M$ along $N$ has the same effect as projecting once. As suggested by the prior items, the condition gives that $t$ leaves vectors in the range space unchanged, and hints that we should take $vec(β)_1$, ..., $vec(β)_r$ to be basis vectors for the range, that is, that we should take the range space of $t$ for $M$ (so that $dim(M)=r$). As for the complement, we write $N$ for the null space of $t$ and we will show that $V=M⊕ N$.  To show this, we can show that their intersection is trivial $M intersection N={0}$ and that they sum to the entire space $M+N=V$. For the first, if a vector $vec(m)$ is in the range space then there is a $vec(v) in V$ with $t(vec(v))=vec(m)$, and the condition on $t$ gives that $t(vec(m))=(∘{t}{t})(vec(v))=t(vec(v))=vec(m)$, while if that same vector is also in the null space then $t(vec(m))=0$ and so the intersection of the range space and null space is trivial. For the second, to write an arbitrary $vec(v)$ as the sum of a vector from the range space and a vector from the null space, the fact that the condition $t(vec(v))=t(t(vec(v)))$ can be rewritten as $t(vec(v)-t(vec(v)))=0$ suggests taking $vec(v)=t(vec(v))+(vec(v)-t(vec(v)))$.  To finish we taking a basis $B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n}$ for $V$ where $sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_r}$ is a basis for the range space $M$ and $sequence{vec(β)_{r+1},...,vec(β)_n}$ is a basis for the null space $N$. Every projection (as defined in this exercise) is a projection into its range space and along its null space. This also follows immediately from the third item.                                   A square matrix is symmetric  if each $ i,j $ entry equals the $ j,i $ entry (i.e., if the matrix equals its transpose). Show that the projection matrix $ A(AᵀA)^{-1}Aᵀ $ is symmetric.  Hint. Find properties of transposes by looking in the index under `transpose'.  For any matrix $M$ we have that $trans{(M^{-1})}=(Mᵀ)^{-1}$, and for any two matrices $M$, $N$ we have that $MNᵀ=NᵀMᵀ$ (provided, of course, that the inverse and product are defined). Applying these two gives that the matrix equals its transpose. $ trans{[(A(AᵀA)^{-1}Aᵀ])} =(trans(Aᵀ)) (trans{[((AᵀA)^{-1}])}) (Aᵀ) =(trans(Aᵀ)) ( [(trans((AᵀA))])^{-1} ) (Aᵀ) =A (Aᵀtrans(Aᵀ))^{-1} Aᵀ =A (AᵀA)^{-1} Aᵀ $            textit{This Topic requires the formulas from the subsections on Orthogonal Projection Into a Line and Projection Into a Subspace.}  Scientists are often presented with a system that has no solution and they must find an answer anyway. More precisely, they must find a best answer. For instance, this is the result of flipping a penny, including some intermediate numbers.   number of flips 30 60 90  number of heads 16 34 51   Because of the randomness in this experiment we expect that the ratio of heads to flips will fluctuate around a penny's long-term ratio of 50-50. So the system for such an experiment likely has no solution, and that's what happened here. $ $ 30m = 16 60m = 34 90m = 51 $ $ That is, the vector of data that we collected is not in the subspace where theory has it. $ [16 34 51] not in { m[30 60 90] such that m in ℝ} $ However, we have to do something so we look for the~$m$ that most nearly works. An orthogonal projection of the data vector into the line subspace gives this best guess. $ frac( [16 34 51]dot product of [30 60 90] ){ [30 60 90]dot product of [30 60 90] } ·[30 60 90] =(7110/12600)· [30 60 90] $ The estimate ($ m=7110/12600≈ 0.56 $) is a bit more than one half, but not much more than half, so probably the penny is fair enough.  The line with the slope $ m≈ 0.56 $ is the line of best fit  for this data.    Minimizing the distance between the given vector and the vector used as the right-hand side minimizes the total of these vertical lengths, and consequently we say that the line comes from fitting by least-squares.    This diagram exaggerates the vertical scale by a factor of ten to make the lengths more visible.  In the above equation the line must pass through $ (0,0) $, because we take it to be the line whose slope is this coin's true proportion of heads to flips. We can also handle cases where the line need not pass through the origin.  Here is the progression of world record times for the men's mile race . In the early 1900's many people wondered when, or if, this record would fall below the four minute mark. Here are the times that were in force on January first of each decade through the first half of that century.   year $1870$1880$1890$1900$ $1910$1920$1930$1940$1950$  secs $268.8$264.5$258.4$255.6$ $255.6$252.6$250.4$246.4$241.4$   We can use this to give a circa 1950 prediction of the date for $240$ seconds, and then compare that to the actual date. As with the penny data, these numbers do not lie in a perfect line. That is, this system does not have an exact solution for the slope and intercept. $ $ b + 1870m = 268.8 b + 1880m = 264.5 ... b + 1950m = 241.4 $ $ We find a best approximation by using orthogonal projection.  (Comments on the data. Restricting to the times at the start of each decade reduces the data entry burden, smooths the data to some extent, and gives much the same result as entering all of the dates and records. There are different sequences of times from competing standards bodies but the ones here are from . We've started the plot at 1870 because at one point there were two classes of records, called `professional' and `amateur', and after a while the first class stopped being active so we've followed the second class.)  Write the linear system's matrix of coefficients and also its vector of constants, the world record times. $ A= ([ 1 1870 1 1880 ... ... 1 1950 ])  vec(v)=[268.8 264.5 ... 241.4] $ The ending result in the subsection on Projection into a Subspace gives the formula for the the coefficients $b$ and $m$ that make the linear combination of $A$'s columns as close as possible to $vec(v)$. Those coefficients are the entries of the vector $(AᵀA)^{-1}Aᵀ·vec(v)$.

The final example compares team salaries from US major league baseball against the number of wins the team had, for the year 2002.

In addition, the model's equation tells us roughly that by spending an additional million dollars a team owner can expect to buy $1/4$ of a win (and that expectation is not very sure, thank goodness).

For the men's mile record, rather than give each of the many records and its exact date, we've ``smoothed'' the data somewhat by taking a periodic sample.

Do the lines of best fit for the men's and women's miles cross?  These are the equations of the lines for men's and women's mile (the vertical intercept term of the equation for the women's mile has been adjusted from the answer above, to zero it at the year $0$, because that's how the men's mile equation was done). $ y =994.8276974-0.3871993827x y =3125.6426-1.445753225x $ Obviously the lines cross. A computer program is the easiest way to do the arithmetic:~MuPAD gives $x=2012.949004$ and $y=215.4150856$ ($215$~seconds is $3$~minutes and $35$~seconds). Remark. Of course all of this projection is highly dubious - for one thing, the equation for the women is influenced by the quite slow early times - but it is nonetheless fun.             textit{(This illustrates that there are data sets for which a linear model is not right, and that the line of best fit doesn't in that case have any predictive value.)} In a highway restaurant a trucker told me that his boss often sends him by a roundabout route, using more gas but paying lower bridge tolls. He said that New York State calibrates the toll for each bridge across the Hudson, playing off the extra gas to get there from New York City against a lower crossing cost, to encourage people to go upstate. This table, from and , lists for each toll crossing of the Hudson River, the distance to drive from Times Square in miles and the cost in US~dollars for a passenger car (if a crossings has a one-way toll then it shows half that number).

When the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986, one of the criticisms made of NASA's decision to launch was in the way they did the analysis of number of O-ring failures versus temperature (O-ring failure caused the explosion). Four O-ring failures would be fatal. NASA had data from $24$ previous flights.   temp ${^circ$F} 53 75 57 58 63 70 70 66 67 67 67  failures 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0   68 69 70 70 72 73 75 76 76 78 79 80 81  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   The temperature that day was forecast to be $ 31^circF$.  NASA based the decision to launch partially on a chart showing only the flights that had at least one O-ring failure. Find the line that best fits these seven flights. On the basis of this data, predict the number of O-ring failures when the temperature is $31$, and when the number of failures will exceed four. Find the line that best fits all 24 flights. On the basis of this extra data, predict the number of O-ring failures when the temperature is $31$, and when the number of failures will exceed four.  Which do you think is the more accurate method of predicting? (An excellent discussion is in .)   A computer algebra system like MAPLE or MuPAD will give an intercept of $b=4259/1398≈ 3.239628$ and a slope of $m=-71/2796≈ -0.025393419$ Plugging $x=31$ into the equation yields a predicted number of O-ring failures of $y=2.45$ (rounded to two places). Plugging in $y=4$ and solving gives a temperature of $x=-29.94^circ$F. On the basis of this information $ A = ([ 1 53 1 75                     ... 1 80 1 81 ])  b = colvec{ 3 2                     ... 0 0} $ MAPLE gives the intercept $b=187/40=4.675$ and the slope $m=-73/1200≈ -0.060833$. Here, plugging $x=31$ into the equation predicts $y=2.79$ O-ring failures (rounded to two places). Plugging in $y=4$~failures gives a temperature of $x=11^circ$F.       This table lists the average distance from the sun to each of the first seven planets, using Earth's average as a unit.

Note that it does not look like a line, and so finding the line of best fit is not fruitful. It does, however look like an exponential curve. Therefore, plot the number of the planet versus the logarithm of the distance. Does this look like a line? The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is what is left of a planet that broke apart. Renumber so that Jupiter is $6$, Saturn is $7$, and Uranus is $8$, and plot against the log again. Does this look better? Use least squares on that data to predict the location of Neptune. Repeat to predict where Pluto is. Is the formula accurate for Neptune and Pluto?  This method was used to help discover Neptune (although the second item is misleading about the history; actually, the discovery of Neptune in position~$9$ prompted people to look for the ``missing planet'' in position~$5$). See   The plot is nonlinear.    Here is the plot.    There is perhaps a jog up between planet~$4$ and planet~$5$. This plot seems even more linear.

Plugging $x=9$ into the equation $y= -0.6780677466+0.2372763818x$ from the prior item gives that the log of the distance is $1.4574197$, so the expected distance is $28.669472$. The actual distance is about $30.003$. Plugging $x=10$ into the same equation gives that the log of the distance is $1.6946961$, so the expected distance is $49.510362$. The actual distance is about $39.503$.                                                                                                                                                    These pairs of pictures contrast the geometric action of the nonlinear maps $ f_1(x)=e^x $ and $ f_2(x)=x^2 $      with the linear maps $ h_1(x)=2x $ and $ h_2(x)=-x $.      Each of the four pictures shows the domain $ ℝ$ on the left mapped to the codomain $ ℝ$ on the right. Arrows trace where each map sends $x=0$, $x=1$, $x=2$, $x=-1$, and $x=-2$.  The nonlinear maps distort the domain in transforming it into the range. For instance, $ f_1(1) $ is further from $f_1(2)$ than it is from $f_1(0)$ - this map spreads the domain out unevenly so that a domain interval near $x=2$ is spread apart more than is a domain interval near $x=0$. The linear maps are nicer, more regular, in that for each map all of the domain spreads by the same factor. The map~$h_1$ on the left spreads all intervals apart to be twice as wide while on the right~$h_2$ keeps intervals the same length but reverses their orientation, as with the rising interval from $1$ to $2$ being transformed to the falling interval from $-1$ to~$-2$.  The only linear maps from $ ℝ$ to $ ℝ$ are multiplications by a scalar but in higher dimensions more can happen. For instance, this linear transformation of $ ℝ^2$ rotates vectors counterclockwise.    The transformation of $ ℝ^3$ that projects vectors into the $xz$-plane is also not simply a rescaling.     Despite this additional variety, even in higher dimensions linear maps behave nicely. Consider a linear $h: ℝ^n → ℝ^m$ and use the standard bases to represent it by a matrix $H$. Recall that $H$ factors into $H=PBQ$ where $P$ and $Q$ are nonsingular and $B$ is a partial-identity matrix. Recall also that nonsingular matrices factor into elementary matrices $PBQ=T_nT_{n-1}·s T_sBT_{s-1}·s T_1$, which are matrices that come from the identity $I$ after one Gaussian row operation, so each $T$ matrix is one of these three kinds $ Ifor step $kρ_i$M_i(k)  Ifor step $ρ_i↔ρ_j$P_{i,j}  Ifor step $kρ_i+ρ_j$C_{i,j}(k) $ with $i ≠ j$, $k ≠ 0$. So if we understand the geometric effect of a linear map described by a partial-identity matrix and the effect of the linear maps described by the elementary matrices then we will in some sense completely understand the effect of any linear map. (The pictures below stick to transformations of $ ℝ^2$ for ease of drawing but the principles extend for maps from any $ ℝ^n$ to any $ ℝ^m$.)  The geometric effect of the linear transformation represented by a partial-identity matrix is projection. $ [x y z] xrightarrow{{$($[r]{@ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 $)$}}}       [x y 0] $  The geometric effect of the $M_i(k)$ matrices is to stretch vectors by a factor of $k$ along the $i$-th axis. This map stretches by a factor of $3$ along the $x$-axis.    If $0≤ k<1$ or if $k<0$ then the $i$-th component goes the other way, here to the left.    Either of these stretches is a dilation.  A transformation represented by a $P_{i,j}$ matrix interchanges the $i$-th and $j$-th axes. This is reflection about the line $x_i=x_j$.    Permutations involving more than two axes decompose into a combination of swaps of pairs of axes; see .  The remaining matrices have the form $C_{i,j}(k)$. For instance $C_{1,2}(2)$ performs $2ρ_1+ρ_2$. $ [x y] xrightarrow{$($[r]{@ 1 0 2 1 $)$}} [x 2x+y] $ In the picture below, the vector $vec(u)$ with the first component of $1$ is affected less than the vector $vec(v)$ with the first component of $2$. The vector $vec(u)$ is mapped to a $h(vec(u))$ that is only $2$ higher than $vec(u)$ while $h(vec(v))$ is $4$ higher than $vec(v)$.    Any vector with a first component of $1$ would be affected in the same way as $vec(u)$: it would slide up by $2$. And any vector with a first component of $2$ would slide up $4$, as was $vec(v)$. That is, the transformation represented by $C_{i,j}(k)$ affects vectors depending on their $i$-th component.  Another way to see this point is to consider the action of this map on the unit square. In the next picture, vectors with a first component of $0$, such as the origin, are not pushed vertically at all but vectors with a positive first component slide up. Here, all vectors with a first component of $1$, the entire right side of the square, slide to the same extent. In general, vectors on the same vertical line slide by the same amount, by twice their first component. The resulting shape has the same base and height as the square (and thus the same area) but the right angle corners are gone.     For contrast, the next picture shows the effect of the map represented by $C_{2,1}(2)$. Here vectors are affected according to their second component: $(x choose y)$ slides horizontally by twice $y$.    In general, for any $C_{i,j}(k)$, the sliding happens so that vectors with the same $i$-th component are slid by the same amount. This kind of map is a shear.  With that we understand the geometric effect of the four types of matrices on the right-hand side of $H=T_nT_{n-1}·s T_jBT_{j-1}·s T_1$ and so in some sense we understand the action of any matrix~$H$. Thus, even in higher dimensions the geometry of linear maps is easy: it is built by putting together a number of components, each of which acts in a simple way.  We will apply this understanding in two ways. The first way is to prove something general about the geometry of linear maps. Recall that under a linear map, the image of a subspace is a subspace and thus the linear transformation $h$ represented by $H$ maps lines through the origin to lines through the origin. (The dimension of the image space cannot be greater than the dimension of the domain space, so a line can't map onto, say, a plane.) We will show that $h$ maps any line- not just one through the origin- to a line. The proof is simple: the partial-identity projection $B$ and the elementary $T_i$'s each turn a line input into a line output; verifying the four cases is . Therefore their composition also preserves lines.    The second way that we will apply the geometric understanding of linear maps is to elucidate a point from Calculus. Below is a picture of the action of the one-variable real function $ y(x)=x^2+x $. As with the nonlinear functions pictured earlier, the geometric effect of this map is irregular in that at different domain points it has different effects; for example as the input~$x$ goes from $2$ to $-2$, the associated output~$f(x)$ at first decreases, then pauses for an instant, and then increases.    But in Calculus we focus less on the map overall and more on the local effect of the map. Below we look closely at what this map does near $x=1$. The derivative is $dy/dx=2x+1$ so that near $ x=1 $ we have $ Delta(y)≈ 3·Delta(x) $.  That is, in a neighborhood of $x=1$, in carrying the domain over this map causes it to grow by a factor of $3$ - it is, locally, approximately, a dilation.  The picture below shows this as a small interval in the domain $(1-Delta(x)..1+Delta(x))$ carried over to an interval in the codomain $(2-Delta(y)..2+Delta(y))$ that is three times as wide.         In higher dimensions the core idea is the same but more can happen. For a function $ y: ℝ^n → ℝ^m $ and a point $ vec(x) in ℝ^n $, the derivative is defined to be the linear map $ h: ℝ^n → ℝ^m $ that best approximates how $ y $ changes near $ y(vec(x)) $. So the geometry described above directly applies to the derivative.                      We close by remarking how this point of view makes clear an often misunderstood result about derivatives, the Chain Rule. Recall that, under suitable conditions on the two functions, the derivative of the composition is this. $ frac{d(∘{g}{f})}{dx}(x) = (dg/dx)(f(x))·(df/dx)(x) $ For instance the derivative of $sin(x^2+3x)$ is $cos(x^2+3x)·(2x+3)$.  Where does this come from? Consider $f,g: ℝ → ℝ$.    The first map $f$ dilates the neighborhood of $x$ by a factor of $ (df/dx)(x) $ and the second map $g$ follows that by dilating a neighborhood of $f(x)$ by a factor of $ (dg/dx)(f(x)) $ and when combined, the composition dilates by the product of the two. In higher dimensions the map expressing how a function changes near a point is a linear map, and is represented by a matrix. The Chain Rule multiplies the matrices.       Let $h: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2$ be the transformation that rotates vectors clockwise by $π/4$~radians.  Find the matrix $H$ representing $h$ with respect to the standard bases. Use Gauss's Method to reduce $H$ to the identity. Translate the row reduction to a matrix equation $T_jT_{j-1}·s T_1H=I$ (the prior item shows both that $H$ is similar to $I$, and that we need no column operations to derive $I$ from $H$). Solve this matrix equation for $H$. Sketch how $H$ is a combination of dilations, flips, skews, and projections (the identity is a trivial projection).    To represent $H$, recall that rotation counterclockwise by $θ$~radians is represented with respect to the standard basis in this way. $ Representation of (h) =([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) sin(θ) cos(θ) ]) $ A clockwise angle is the negative of a counterclockwise one. $ Representation of (h) =([ cos(-π/4) -sin(-π/4) sin(-π/4) cos(-π/4) ]) =([ √{2}/2 √{2}/2 -√{2}/2 √{2}/2 ]) $ This Gauss-Jordan reduction $ for step $ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ √{2}/2 √{2}/2 0 √{2} ]) grstep[(1/√{2})ρ_2]{(2/√{2})ρ_1} ([ 1 1 0 1 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ produces the identity matrix so there is no need for column-swapping operations to end with a partial-identity. In matrix multiplication the reduction is $ ([ 1 -1 0 1 ]) ([ 2/√{2} 0 0 1/√{2} ]) ([ 1 0 1 1 ]) H =I $ (note that composition of the Gaussian operations is from right to left). Taking inverses $ H = underbrace{ ([ 1 0 -1 1 ]) ([ √{2}/2 0 0 √{2} ]) ([ 1 1 0 1 ]) }_P I $ gives the desired factorization of $H$ (here, the partial identity is $I$, and $Q$ is trivial, that is, it is also an identity matrix). Reading the composition from right to left (and ignoring the identity matrices as trivial) gives that $H$ has the same effect as first performing this skew    followed by a dilation that multiplies all first components by $√{2}/2$ (this is a ``shrink'' in that $√{2}/2≈0.707$) and all second components by $√{2}$, followed by another skew.    For instance, the effect of $H$ on the unit vector whose angle with the $x$-axis is $π/6$ is this.    Verifying that the resulting vector has unit length and forms an angle of $-π/12$ with the $x$-axis is routine.    What combination of dilations, flips, skews, and projections produces a rotation counterclockwise by $2π/3$ radians?  We will first represent the map with a matrix $H$, perform the row operations and, if needed, column operations to reduce it to a partial-identity matrix. We will then translate that into a factorization $H=PBQ$. Substituting into the general matrix $ Representation of (r_θ) ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) sin(θ) cos(θ) ]) $ gives this representation. $ rep{r_{2π/3}}{stdbasis(_2),stdbasis(_2)} ([ -1/2 -√{3}/2 √{3}/2 -1/2 ]) $ Gauss's Method is routine. $ grstep{√{3}ρ_1+ρ_2} ([ -1/2 -√{3}/2 0 -2 ]) for step $-2ρ_1$ ([ 1 √{3} 0 1 ]) grstep{-√{3}ρ_2+ρ_1} ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ That translates to a matrix equation in this way. $ ([ 1 -√{3} 0 1 ]) ([ -2 0 0 -1/2 ]) ([ 1 0 √{3} 1 ]) ([ -1/2 -√{3}/2 √{3}/2 -1/2 ]) =I $ Taking inverses to solve for $H$ yields this factorization. $ ([ -1/2 -√{3}/2 √{3}/2 -1/2 ]) = ([ 1 0 -√{3} 1 ]) ([ -1/2 0 0 -2 ]) ([ 1 √{3} 0 1 ]) I $   What combination of dilations, flips, skews, and projections produces the map $h: ℝ^3 → ℝ^3$ represented with respect to the standard bases by this matrix? $ ([ 1 2 1 3 6 0 1 2 2 ]) $  This Gaussian reduction $ for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 1 0 0 -3 0 0 1 ]) for step $(1/3)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 2 1 0 0 -3 0 0 0 ]) for step $(-1/3)ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_1$ ([ 1 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ]) $ gives the reduced echelon form of the matrix. Now the two column operations of taking $-2$ times the first column and adding it to the second, and then of swapping columns two and three produce this partial identity. $ B=([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]) $ All of that translates into matrix terms as:~where $ P= ([ 1 -1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 -1/3 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1/3 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 -1 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 -3 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $ and $ Q= ([ 1 -2 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) $ the given matrix factors as $PBQ$.   Show that any linear transformation of $ ℝ^1$ is the map that multiplies by a scalar $x↦ kx$.  Represent it with respect to the standard bases $stdbasis(_1),stdbasis(_1)$, then the only entry in the resulting $N by N$ matrix is the scalar $k$.   Show that for any permutation (that is, reordering) $p$ of the numbers $1$, ..., $n$, the map $ [x_1 x_2 ... x_n] ↦ [x_{p(1)] x_{p(2)} ... x_{p(n)}} $ can be done with a composition of maps, each of which only swaps a single pair of coordinates. Hint: you can use induction on $n$. (Remark:~in the fourth chapter we will show this and we will also show that the parity of the number of swaps used is determined by $p$. That is, although a particular permutation could be expressed in two different ways with two different numbers of swaps, either both ways use an even number of swaps, or both use an odd number.)  We can show this by induction on the number of components in the vector. In the $n=1$ base case the only permutation is the trivial one, and the map $ [x_1] ↦ [x_1] $ is expressible as a composition of swaps- as zero swaps. For the inductive step we assume that the map induced by any permutation of fewer than $n$ numbers can be expressed with swaps only, and we consider the map induced by a permutation $p$ of $n$ numbers. $ [x_1 x_2 ... x_n] ↦ [x_{p(1)] x_{p(2)} ... x_{p(n)}} $ Consider the number~$i$ such that $p(i)=n$. The map $ [x_1 x_2 ... x_i ... x_n] mapsunder(p̂) [x_{p(1)] x_{p(2)} ... x_{p(n)} ... x_{n}} $ will, when followed by the swap of the $i$-th and $n$-th components, give the map~$p$. Now, the inductive hypothesis gives that $p̂$ is achievable as a composition of swaps.   Show that linear maps preserve the linear structures of a space.  Show that for any linear map from $ ℝ^n$ to $ ℝ^m$, the image of any line is a line. The image may be a degenerate line, that is, a single point. Show that the image of any linear surface is a linear surface. This generalizes the result that under a linear map the image of a subspace is a subspace. Linear maps preserve other linear ideas. Show that linear maps preserve ``betweeness'':~if the point $B$ is between $A$ and $C$ then the image of $B$ is between the image of $A$ and the image of $C$.    A line is a subset of $ ℝ^n$ of the form ${vec{{v}=vec{{u}+t·vec{{w} such that t in ℝ}$. The image of a point on that line is $h(vec(v))=h(vec(u)+t·vec(w))=h(vec(u))+t· h(vec(w))$, and the set of such vectors, as $t$ ranges over the reals, is a line (albeit, degenerate if $h(vec(w))=0$). This is an obvious extension of the prior argument. If the point~$B$ is between the points~$A$ and~$C$ then the line from $A$ to $C$ has $B$ in it. That is, there is a $t in (0..1)$ such that $vec(b)=vec(a)+t· (vec(-)vec(a))$ (where $B$ is the endpoint of $vec(b)$, etc.). Now, as in the argument of the first item, linearity shows that $h(vec(b))=h(vec(a))+t· h(vec(-)vec(a))$.    Use a picture like the one that appears in the discussion of the Chain Rule to answer:~if a function $f: ℝ → ℝ$ has an inverse, what's the relationship between how the function - locally, approximately - dilates space, and how its inverse dilates space (assuming, of course, that it has an inverse)?  The two are inverse. For instance, for a fixed $x in ℝ$, if $f^prime(x)=k$ (with $k ≠ 0$) then $(f^{-1})^prime(x)=1/k$.                 A Chinese legend tells the story of a flood by the Lo river. People offered sacrifices to appease the river. Each time a turtle emerged, walked around the sacrifice, and returned to the water. Fuh-Hi, the founder of Chinese civilization, interpreted this to mean that the river was still cranky. Fortunately, a child noticed that on its shell the turtle had the pattern on the left below, which is today called Lo Shu (``river scroll'').  vcenteredhbox{ includegraphics[height=.8in]{LoShu.png}}    $4$9$2$ $3$5$7$ $8$1$6$   The dots make the matrix on the right where the rows, columns, and diagonals add to $15$. Now that the people knew how much to sacrifice, the river's anger cooled.   A square matrix is magic if each row, column, and diagonal add to the same number, the matrix's magic number.  Another magic square appears in the engraving Melencolia I by D\"urer.   includegraphics[height=2.20in]{Melencolia.jpg}  One interpretation is that it depicts melancholy, a depressed state. The figure, genius, has a wealth of fascinating things to explore including the compass, the geometrical solid, the scale, and the hourglass. But the figure is unmoved; all of the things lie unused. One of the potential delights, in the upper right, is a $N by N$ matrix whose rows, columns, and diagonals add to~$34$.  vcenteredhbox{ includegraphics[height=1.25in]{Melencoliadetail.jpg}}    $16$3$2$13$ $5$10$11$8$ $9$6$7$12$ $4$15$14$1$   The middle entries on the bottom row give $1514$, the date of the engraving.  The above two squares are arrangements of $ interval{1}{n^2}$. They are normal . The $N by N$ square whose sole entry is $1$ is normal, shows that there is no normal $N by N$ magic square, and there are normal magic squares of every other size; see . Finding how many normal magic squares there are of each size is an unsolved problem; see .  If we don't require that the squares be normal then we can say much more. Every $N by N$ square is magic, trivially. If the rows, columns, and diagonals of a $N by N$ matrix $ ([ a b c d ]) $ add to~$s$ then $a+b=s$, $c+d=s$, $a+c=s$, $b+d=s$, $a+d=s$, and $b+c=s$. shows that this system has the unique solution $a=b=c=d=s/2$. So the set of $N by N$ magic squares is a one-dimensional subspace of $matspace(_){N by N}$.  A sum of two same-sized magic squares is magic and a scalar multiple of a magic square is magic so the set of $N by N$ magic squares $MagicSquare_{n}$ is a vector space, a subspace of $matspace(_){N by N}$. This Topic shows that for $n≥ 3$ the dimension of $MagicSquare_{n}$ is $n^2-n$. The set $magicsquares(_){n,0}$ of $N by N$~magic squares with magic number~$0$ is another subspace and we will verify the formula for its dimension also: $n^2-2n-1$ when $n≥ 3$.  We will first prove that $dimMagicSquare_{n}=dimmagicsquares(_){n,0}+1$. Define the trace of a matrix to be the sum down its upper-left to lower-right diagonal $tr (M)=m_{1,1}+·s+m_{n,n}$. Consider the restriction of the trace to the magic squares $tr: MagicSquare_{n} → ℝ$. The null space $νllspace{tr}$ is the set of magic squares with magic number zero $magicsquares(_){n,0}$. Observe that the trace is onto because for any~$r$ in the codomain $ ℝ$ the $N by N$ matrix whose entries are all $r/n$ is a magic square with magic number~$r$. Theorem~Two.II. says that for any linear map the dimension of the domain equals the dimension of the range space plus the dimension of the null space, the map's rank plus its nullity. Here the domain is $MagicSquare_{n}$, the range space is $ ℝ$ and the null space is $magicsquares(_){n,0}$, so we have that $dimMagicSquare_{n}=1+dimmagicsquares(_){n,0}$.  We will finish by finding the dimension of the vector space $magicsquares(_){n,0}$. For $n=1$ the dimension is clearly $0$. shows that $dimmagicsquares(_){n,0}$ is also $0$ for $n=2$.  That leaves showing that $dimmagicsquares(_){n,0}=n^2-2n-1$ for $n≥ 3$. The fact that the squares in this vector space are magic gives us a linear system of restrictions, and the fact that they have magic number zero makes this system homogeneous: for instance consider the $N by N$ case. The restriction that the rows, columns, and diagonals of $ ([ a b c d e f g h i ]) $ add to zero gives this $nbym((2n+2)){n^2}$ linear system. $ $ a + b + c = 0 d + e + f = 0 g + h + i = 0 a + d + g = 0 b + e + h = 0 c + f + i = 0 a + e + i = 0 c + e + g = 0 $ $ We will find the dimension of the space by finding the number of free variables in the linear system.  The matrix of coefficients for the particular cases of $n=3$ and~$n=4$ are below, with the rows and columns numbered to help in reading the proof. With respect to the standard basis, each represents a linear map $map(h){ ℝ^{n^2}}{ ℝ^{2n+2}}$. The domain has dimension~$n^2$ so if we show that the rank of the matrix is $2n+1$ then we will have what we want, that the dimension of the null space $magicsquares(_){n,0}$ is $n^2-(2n+1)$. newlength( interblockhspace) setlength( interblockhspace){1.45em} newlength( interblockvspace) setlength( interblockvspace){1ex} newlength(\colwidth) settowidth(\colwidth){$9$} $ $ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  vec(ρ)_1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 vec(ρ)_2 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 vec(ρ)_3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 [ interblockvspace] vec(ρ)_4 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 vec(ρ)_5 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 vec(ρ)_6 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 [ interblockvspace] vec(ρ)_7 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 vec(ρ)_8 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 $ $ $ $ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [ [ [ [ [ [ [  vec(ρ)_1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 vec(ρ)_2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 vec(ρ)_3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 vec(ρ)_4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 [ interblockvspace] vec(ρ)_5 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 vec(ρ)_6 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 vec(ρ)_7 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 vec(ρ)_8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 [ interblockvspace] vec(ρ)_9 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 vec(ρ)_{10} 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 $ $  We want to show that the rank of the matrix of coefficients, the number of rows in a maximal linearly independent set, is $2n+1$. The first $n$~rows of the matrix of coefficients add to the same vector as the second $n$~rows, the vector of all ones. So a maximal linearly independent must omit at least one row. We will show that the set of all rows but the first $setinterval{vec(ρ)_2}{vec(ρ)_{2n+2}}$ is linearly independent. So consider this linear relationship. $ c_2vec(ρ)_2+·s+c_{2n}vec(ρ)_{2n} +c_{2n+1}vec(ρ)_{2n+1}+c_{2n+2}vec(ρ)_{2n+2}=0  $  Now it gets messy. Focus on the lower left of the tables. Observe that in the final two rows, in the first~$n$ columns, is a subrow that is all zeros except that it starts with a one in column~$1$ and a subrow that is all zeros except that it ends with a one in column~$n$.  First, with $vec(ρ)_1$ omitted, both column~$1$ and column~$n$ contain only two ones. Since the only rows in~($*$) with nonzero column~$1$ entries are rows $vec(ρ)_{n+1}$ and $vec(ρ)_{2n+1}$, which have ones, we must have $c_{2n+1}=-c_{n+1}$. Likewise considering the $n$-th entries of the vectors in~($*$) gives that $c_{2n+2}=-c_{2n}$.  Next consider the columns between those two- in the $n=3$ table this includes only column~$2$ while in the $n=4$~table it includes both columns~$2$ and~$3$. Each such column has a single one. That is, for each column index $j insetinterval(2){n-2}$ the column consists of only zeros except for a one in row~$n+j$, and hence $c_{n+j}=0$.  On to the next block of columns, from $n+1$ through~$2n$. Column~$n+1$ has only two ones (because $n≥ 3$ the ones in the last two rows do not fall in the first column of this block). Thus $c_2=-c_{n+1}$ and therefore $c_2=c_{2n+1}$. Likewise, from column~$2n$ we conclude that $c_2=-c_{2n}$ and so $c_2=c_{2n+2}$.  Because $n≥ 3$ there is at least one column between column~$n+1$ and column~$2n-1$. In at least one of those columns a one appears in $vec(ρ)_{2n+1}$. If a one also appears in that column in $vec(ρ)_{2n+2}$ then we have $c_2=-(c_{2n+1}+c_{2n+2})$ since $c_{n+j}=0$ for $j insetinterval(2){n-2}$. If a one does not appear in that column in $vec(ρ)_{2n+2}$ then we have $c_2=-c_{2n+1}$. In either case $c_2=0$, and thus $c_{2n+1}=c_{2n+2}=0$ and $c_{n+1}=c_{2n}=0$.  If the next block of $n$-many columns is not the last then similarly conclude from its first column that $c_3=c_{n+1}=0$.  Keep this up until we reach the last block of columns, those numbered $(n-1)n+1$ through~$n^2$. Because $c_{n+1}=·s=c_{2n}=0$ column~$n^2$ gives that $c_{n}=-c_{2n+1}=0$.  Therefore the rank of the matrix is $2n+1$, as required.   The classic source on normal magic squares is . More on the Lo Shu square is at . The proof given here began with .   Let $M$ be a $N by N$ magic square with magic number~$s$.  Prove that the sum of $M$'s entries is $3s$. Prove that $s=3· m_{2,2}$. Prove that $m_{2,2}$ is the average of the entries in its row, its column, and in each diagonal. Prove that $m_{2,2}$ is the median of $M$'s entries.    The sum of the entries of $M$ is the sum of the sums of the three rows. The constraints on entries of $M$ involving the center entry make this system. $ $ m_{2,1} + m_{2,2} + m_{2,3} = s m_{1,2} + m_{2,2} + m_{3,2} = s m_{1,1} + m_{2,2} + m_{3,3} = s m_{1,3} + m_{2,2} + m_{3,1} = s $ $ Adding those four equations counts each matrix entry once and only once, except that we count the center entry four times. Thus the left side sums to $3s+3m_{2,2}$ while the right sums to $4s$. So $3m_{2,2}=s$.  The second row adds to $s$ so $m_{2,1}+m_{2,2}+m_{2,3}=3m_{2,2}$, giving that $(1/2)·(m_{2,1}+m_{2,3})=m_{2,2}$. The same goes for the column and the diagonals.  By the prior exercise either both $m_{2,1}$ and $m_{2,3}$ are equal to $m_{2,2}$ or else one is greater while one is smaller. Thus $m_{2,2}$ is the median of the set ${m_{{2,1},m_{{2,2},m_{{2,3}}$. The same reasoning applied to the second column shows that Thus $m_{2,2}$ is the median of the set ${m_{{1,2},m_{{2,1},m_{{2,2},m_{{2,3},m_{{3,2}}$. Extending to the two diagonals shows it is the median of the set of all entries.    Solve the system $a+b=s$, $c+d=s$, $a+c=s$, $b+d=s$, $a+d=s$, and $b+c=s$.  For any $k$ we have this. $ ([ 1 1 0 0 s 0 0 1 1 s 1 0 1 0 s 0 1 0 1 s 1 0 0 1 s 0 1 1 0 s ]) for step $-ρ_1+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 0 0 s 0 0 1 1 s 0 -1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 s 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 s ]) for step $-ρ_2↔ρ_6$ ([ 1 1 0 0 s 0 1 1 0 s 0 -1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 s 0 -1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 s ]) for step $-ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 1 0 0 s 0 1 1 0 s 0 0 2 0 s 0 1 -1 1 0 0 0 1 1 s 0 0 1 1 s ]) $ The unique solution is $a=b=c=d=s/2$.   Show that $dimmagicsquares(_){2,0}=0$.  By the prior exercise the only member is $Z_{N by N}$.   Let the trace function be $tr (M)=m_{1,1}+·s+m_{n,n}$. Define also the sum down the other diagonal $tr^* (M)=m_{1,n}+·s+m_{n,1}$.   Show that the two functions $map(tr,tr^*){matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ}$ are linear.  Show that the function $map(θ){matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ^2}$ given by $θ(M)=(tr(M),tr^*(m))$ is linear.  Generalize the prior item.     Where $M,N inmatspace(_){N by N}$ we have $tr(cM+dN)=(cm_{1,1}+dn_{1,1})+·s+(cm_{n,n}+dn_{n,n}) =(cm_{1,1}+·s+cm_{n,n})+(dn_{1,1}+·s+dn_{n,n}) =c·tr(M)+d·tr(N)$ where all numbers are real, so the trace preserves linear combinations. The argument for $tr^*$ is similar.  It preserves linear combinations: where all numbers are real, $θ(cM+dN)=(tr(cM+dN),tr^*(cM+dN)) =(c·tr(M)+d·tr(N), c·tr^*(M)+d·tr^*(N)) =c·θ(M)+d·θ(N)$.  Where $h_1,...,h_n: V → W$ are linear then so is $g: V → W^n$ given by $g(vec(v))=(h_1(vec(v)), ..., h_n(vec(v)))$. The proof just follows the proof of the prior item.   A square matrix is semimagic if the rows and columns add to the same value, that is, if we drop the condition on the diagonals.   Show that the set of semimagic squares $SemiMagicSquare_{n}$ is a subspace of $matspace(_){N by N}$.  Show that the set $semimagicsquares(_){n,0}$ of $N by N$~semimagic squares with magic number~$0$ is also a subspace of $matspace(_){N by N}$.     The sum of two semimagic squares is semimagic, as is a scalar multiple of a semimagic square.  As with the prior item, a linear combination of two semimagic squares with magic number zero is also such a matrix.                                                                                                                                                        Here is a simple game: a player bets on coin tosses, a dollar each time, and the game ends either when the player has no money or is up to five dollars. If the player starts with three dollars, what is the chance that the game takes at least five flips? Twenty-five flips?  At any point, this player has either $0, or $1, ..., or $5. We say that the player is in the state $s_0$, $s_1$, ..., or $s_5$. In the game the player moves from state to state. For instance, a player now in state $s_3$ has on the next flip a $0.5$ chance of moving to state $s_2$ and a $0.5$ chance of moving to $s_4$. The boundary states are different; a player never leaves state~$s_0$ or state~$s_5$.  Let $p_{i}(n)$ be the probability that the player is in state $s_{i}$ after $n$ flips. Then for instance the probability of being in state~$s_0$ after flip~$n+1$ is $p_{0}(n+1)=p_{0}(n)+0.5· p_{1}(n)$. This equation summarizes. $   ([ 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 ])  [p_{0](n) p_{1}(n) p_{2}(n) p_{3}(n) p_{4}(n) p_{5}(n)} =[p_{0](n+1) p_{1}(n+1) p_{2}(n+1) p_{3}(n+1) p_{4}(n+1) p_{5}(n+1)} $  Sage will compute the evolution of this game.  sage: M = matrix(RDF, [[1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ....: [0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ....: [0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ....: [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0], ....: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5], ....: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0]]) sage: M = M.transpose() sage: v0 = vector(RDF, [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]) sage: v1 = v0*M sage: v1 (0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0) sage: v2 = v1*M sage: v2 (0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25)  (Two notes: (1)~Sage can use various number systems to make the matrix entries and here we have used Real Double Float, and (2)~Sage likes to do matrix multiplication from the right, as $vec(v)M$ instead of our usual $Mvec(v)$, so we needed to take the matrix's transpose.)

For instance, after the fourth flip there is already a $0.50$~probability that the game is over.    This is a Markov chain. Each vector is a probability vector, whose entries are nonnegative real numbers that sum to $1$. The matrix is a transition matrix  or stochastic matrix,  whose entries are nonnegative reals and whose columns sum to $1$.  A characteristic feature of a Markov chain model is that it is historyless in that the next state depends only on the current state, not on any prior ones. Thus, a player who arrives at $s_2$ by starting in state $s_3$ and then going to state~$s_2$ has exactly the same chance of moving next to $s_3$ as does a player whose history was to start in $s_3$ then go to~$s_4$ then to~$s_3$ and then to~$s_2$.  Here is a Markov chain from sociology. A study (, p.~202) divided occupations in the United Kingdom into three levels: executives and professionals, supervisors and skilled manual workers, and unskilled workers. They asked about two thousand men, ``At what level are you, and at what level was your father when you were fourteen years old?'' Here the Markov model assumption about history may seem reasonable- we may guess that while a parent's occupation has a direct influence on the occupation of the child, the grandparent's occupation likely has no such direct influence. This summarizes the study's conclusions. $   ([ .60 .29 .16 .26 .37 .27 .14 .34 .57 ])  [p_{U](n) p_{M}(n) p_{L}(n)} =[p_{U](n+1) p_{M}(n+1) p_{L}(n+1)} $ For instance, looking at the middle class for the next generation, a child of an upper class worker has a $0.26$~probability of becoming middle class, a child of a middle class worker has a $0.37$~chance of being middle class, and a child of a lower class worker has a $0.27$ probability of becoming middle class.

In professional American baseball there are two leagues, the American League and the National League. At the end of the annual season the team winning the American League and the team winning the National League play the World Series.  The winner is the first team to take four games. That means that a series is in one of twenty-four states: $0$-$0$ (no games won yet by either team), $1$-$0$ (one game won for the American League team and no games for the National League team), etc.  Consider a series with a probability $p$ that the American League team wins each game.

They also give us an example of the use of matrices where we do not consider the significance of the maps represented by the matrices. For more on Markov chains, there are many sources such as and .      These questions refer to the coin-flipping game.  Check the computations in the table at the end of the first paragraph. Consider the second row of the vector table. Note that this row has alternating $0$'s. Must $p_{1}(j)$ be $0$ when $j$ is odd? Prove that it must be, or produce a counterexample. Perform a computational experiment to estimate the chance that the player ends at five dollars, starting with one dollar, two dollars, and four dollars.

Note first that this is true in the $n=0$ base case by the initial conditions. For the inductive step, suppose that it is true in the $n=0$, $n=1$, ..., $n=k$~cases and consider the $n=k+1$ case. If $k+1$ is odd then the two $ p_{1}(k+1) = 0.5· p_{2}(k)=0.5· 0=0  p_{3}(k+1) =0.5· p_{2}(k)+0.5· p_{4}(k) =0.5· 0+0.5· 0 =0 $ follow from the inductive hypothesis that $p_{2}(k)=p_{4}(k)=0$ since $k$ is even. The case where $k+1$ is even is similar. We can use, say, $n=100$.

(The Z entry is a ``birth-death'' state.

There is a $0.021$ probability that a firm in the National Census of Manufacturers will move into Electronics, or be created, or move in from abroad, into the Northeast. Finally, with probability $0.954$ a firm out of the categories will stay out, according to this research.)  Does the Markov model assumption of lack of history seem justified?

It does seem reasonable that, while the firm's present location should strongly influence where it is next time (for instance, whether it stays), any locations in the prior stages should have little influence. That is, while a company may move or stay because of where it is, it is unlikely to move or stay because of where it was.

Here is a model of some kinds of learning The learner starts in an undecided state $s_U$. Eventually the learner has to decide to do either response $A$ (that is, end in state $s_A$) or response $B$ (ending in $s_B$). However, the learner doesn't jump right from undecided to sure that $A$ is the correct thing to do (or $B$). Instead, the learner spends some time in a ``tentative-$A$'' state, or a ``tentative-$B$'' state, trying the response out (denoted here $t_A$ and $t_B$). Imagine that once the learner has decided, it is final, so once in $s_A$ or $s_B$, the learner stays there. For the other state changes, we can posit transitions with probability $p$ in either direction.  Construct the transition matrix. Take $p=0.25$ and take the initial vector to be $1$ at $s_U$. Run this for five steps. What is the chance of ending up at $s_A$? Do the same for $p=0.20$. Graph $p$ versus the chance of ending at $s_A$. Is there a threshold value for $p$, above which the learner is almost sure not to take longer than five steps?    This is the relevant system of equations. $ $ (1-2p)· s_{U}(n) + p· t_{A}(n) + p· t_{B}(n)  = s_{U}(n+1) p· s_{U}(n) + (1-2p)· t_{A}(n) = t_{A}(n+1) p· s_{U}(n) + (1-2p)· t_{B}(n) = t_{B}(n+1) p· t_{A}(n) + s_{A}(n) = s_{A}(n+1) p· t_{B}(n) + s_{B}(n) = s_{B}(n+1) $ $ Thus we have this. $ ([ 1-2p p p 0 0 p 1-2p 0 0 0 p 0 1-2p 0 0 0 p 0 1 0 0 0 p 0 1 ]) [s_{U](n) t_{A}(n) t_{B}(n) s_{A}(n) s_{B}(n)} = [s_{U](n+1) t_{A}(n+1) t_{B}(n+1) s_{A}(n+1) s_{B}(n+1)} $ This is the Octave code, with the output removed.  octave:1> T=[.5,.25,.25,0,0; > .25,.5,0,0,0; > .25,0,.5,0,0; > 0,.25,0,1,0; > 0,0,.25,0,1] T = 0.50000 0.25000 0.25000 0.00000 0.00000 0.25000 0.50000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.25000 0.00000 0.50000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.25000 0.00000 1.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.25000 0.00000 1.00000 octave:2> p0=[1;0;0;0;0] octave:3> p1=T*p0 octave:4> p2=T*p1 octave:5> p3=T*p2 octave:6> p4=T*p3 octave:7> p5=T*p4  Here is the output.

What is the chance of the National League team winning it all, even though they have only a probability of $0.45$ or $0.40$ of winning any one game? Graph the probability $p$ against the chance that the American League team wins it all. Is there a threshold value- a $p$ above which the better team is essentially ensured of winning?

Check that the three transition matrices shown in this Topic meet these two conditions. Must any transition matrix do so? Observe that if $Avec(v)_0=vec(v)_1$ and $Avec(v)_1=vec(v)_2$ then $A^2$ is a transition matrix from $vec(v)_0$ to $vec(v)_2$. Show that a power of a transition matrix is also a transition matrix. Generalize the prior item by proving that the product of two appropriately-sized transition matrices is a transition matrix.    They must satisfy this condition because the total probability of a state transition (including back to the same state) is $100\ See the answer to the third item. We will do the $N by N$ case; bigger-sized cases are just notational problems. This product $ ([ a_{1,1} a_{1,2} a_{2,1} a_{2,2} ]) ([ b_{1,1} b_{1,2} b_{2,1} b_{2,2} ]) =([ a_{1,1}b_{1,1}+a_{1,2}b_{2,1} a_{1,1}b_{1,2}+a_{1,2}b_{2,2} a_{2,1}b_{1,1}+a_{2,2}b_{2,1} a_{2,1}b_{1,2}+a_{2,2}b_{2,2} ]) $ has these two column sums $ (a_{1,1}b_{1,1}+a_{1,2}b_{2,1}) +(a_{2,1}b_{1,1}+a_{2,2}b_{2,1}) =(a_{1,1}+a_{2,1})· b_{1,1} +(a_{1,2}+a_{2,2})· b_{2,1} =1· b_{1,1}+1· b_{2,1} =1 $ and $ (a_{1,1}b_{1,2}+a_{1,2}b_{2,2}) +(a_{2,1}b_{1,2}+a_{2,2}b_{2,2}) =(a_{1,1}+a_{2,1})· b_{1,2} +(a_{1,2}+a_{2,2})· b_{2,2} =1· b_{1,2}+1· b_{2,2} =1 $ as required.                                                               In The Elements, Euclid considers two figures to be the same if they have the same size and shape. That is, while the triangles below are not equal because they are not the same set of points, they are, for Euclid's purposes, essentially indistinguishable because we can imagine picking the plane up, sliding it over and rotating it a bit, although not warping or stretching it, and then putting it back down, to superimpose the first figure on the second. (Euclid never explicitly states this principle but he uses it often .)    In modern terms ``picking the plane up~...'' is taking a map from the plane to itself. Euclid considers only transformations that may slide or turn the plane but not bend or stretch it. Accordingly, define a map $f: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2$ to be distance-preserving  or a rigid motion or an isometry if for all points $P_1,P_2 in ℝ^2$, the distance from $f(P_1)$ to $f(P_2)$ equals the distance from $P_1$ to $P_2$. We also define a plane figure to be a set of points in the plane and we say that two figures are congruent if there is a distance-preserving map from the plane to itself that carries one figure onto the other.  Many statements from Euclidean geometry follow easily from these definitions. Some are: (i)~collinearity is invariant under any distance-preserving map (that is, if $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ are collinear then so are $f(P_1)$, $f(P_2)$, and $f(P_3)$), (ii)~betweeness is invariant under any distance-preserving map (if $P_2$ is between $P_1$ and $P_3$ then so is $f(P_2)$ between $f(P_1)$ and $f(P_3)$), (iii)~the property of being a triangle is invariant under any distance-preserving map (if a figure is a triangle then the image of that figure is also a triangle), (iv)~and the property of being a circle is invariant under any distance-preserving map. In 1872, F.~Klein suggested that we can define Euclidean geometry as the study of properties that are invariant under these maps. (This forms part of Klein's Erlanger Program, which proposes the organizing principle that we can describe each kind of geometry- Euclidean, projective, etc.- as the study of the properties that are invariant under some group of transformations. The word `group' here means more than just `collection' but that lies outside of our scope.)  We can use linear algebra to characterize the distance-preserving maps of the plane.  To begin, observe that there are distance-preserving transformations of the plane that are not linear. The obvious example is this translation. $ [x y] ↦ [x y]+[1 0]=[x+1 y] $ However, this example turns out to be the only one, in that if $f$ is distance-preserving and sends $0$ to $vec(v)_0$ then the map $vec(v)↦ f(vec(v))-vec(v)_0$ is linear. That will follow immediately from this statement:~a map $t$ that is distance-preserving and sends $0$ to itself is linear. To prove this equivalent statement, consider the standard basis and suppose that $ t(vec(e)_1)=[a b]  t(vec(e)_2)=[c d] $ for some $a,b,c,d in ℝ$. To show that $t$ is linear we can show that it can be represented by a matrix, that is, that $t$ acts in this way for all $x,y in ℝ$. $ vec(v)=[x y] t ↓ [ax+cy bx+dy] tag*{($*$)}$ Recall that if we fix three non-collinear points then we can determine any point by giving its distance from those three. So we can determine any point $vec(v)$ in the domain by its distance from $0$, $vec(e)_1$, and $vec(e)_2$. Similarly, we can determine any point $t(vec(v))$ in the codomain by its distance from the three fixed points $t(0)$, $t(vec(e)_1)$, and $t(vec(e)_2)$ (these three are not collinear because, as mentioned above, collinearity is invariant and $0$, $vec(e)_1$, and $vec(e)_2$ are not collinear). Because $t$ is distance-preserving we can say more:~for the point $vec(v)$ in the plane that is determined by being the distance $d_0$ from $0$, the distance $d_1$ from $vec(e)_1$, and the distance $d_2$ from $vec(e)_2$, its image $t(vec(v))$ must be the unique point in the codomain that is determined by being $d_0$ from $t(0)$, $d_1$ from $t(vec(e)_1)$, and $d_2$ from $t(vec(e)_2)$. Because of the uniqueness, checking that the action in ($*$) works in the $d_0$, $d_1$, and $d_2$ cases $ dist([x y],0) =dist(t([x y]),t(0)) =dist([ax+cy bx+dy],0) $ (we assumed that $t$ maps $0$ to itself) $ dist([x y],vec(e)_1) =dist(t([x y]),t(vec(e)_1)) =dist([ax+cy bx+dy],[a b]) $ and $ dist([x y],vec(e)_2) =dist(t([x y]),t(vec(e)_2)) =dist([ax+cy bx+dy],[c d]) $ suffices to show that ($*$) describes $t$. Those checks are routine.  Thus any distance-preserving $f: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2$ is a linear map plus a translation, $f(vec(v))=t(vec(v))+vec(v)_0$ for some constant vector $vec(v)_0$ and linear map $t$ that is distance-preserving. So in order to understand distance-preserving maps what remains is to understand distance-preserving linear maps.  Not every linear map is distance-preserving. For example $vec(v)↦ 2vec(v)$ does not preserve distances.  But there is a neat characterization:~a linear transformation $t$ of the plane is distance-preserving if and only if both $norm{t(vec(e)_1)}=norm{t(vec(e)_2)}=1$, and $t(vec(e)_1)$ is orthogonal to $t(vec(e)_2)$. The `only if' half of that statement is easy- because $t$ is distance-preserving it must preserve the lengths of vectors and because $t$ is distance-preserving the Pythagorean theorem shows that it must preserve orthogonality. To show the `if' half we can check that the map preserves lengths of vectors because then for all $vec(p)$ and $vec(q)$ the distance between the two is preserved $norm{t(vec(p)-vec(q))}=norm{t(vec(p))-t(vec(q))} =norm{vec(p)-vec(q)}$. For that check let $ vec(v)=[x y]  t(vec(e)_1)=[a b]  t(vec(e)_2)=[c d] $ and with the `if' assumptions that $a^2+b^2=c^2+d^2=1$ and $ac+bd=0$ we have this. $ norm{t(vec(v))}^2 = (ax+cy)^2+(bx+dy)^2 = a^2x^2+2acxy+c^2y^2+b^2x^2+2bdxy+d^2y^2 = x^2(a^2+b^2)+y^2(c^2+d^2)+2xy(ac+bd) = x^2 + y^2 = norm{vec(v)}^2 $  One thing that is neat about this characterization is that we can easily recognize matrices that represent such a map with respect to the standard bases: the columns are of length one and are mutually orthogonal. This is an orthonormal matrix  (or, more informally, orthogonal matrix since people often use this term to mean not just that the columns are orthogonal but also that they have length one).  We can leverage this characterization to understand the geometric actions of distance-preserving maps. Because $norm{t(vec(v))}=norm{vec(v)}$, the map~$t$ sends any $vec(v)$ somewhere on the circle about the origin that has radius equal to the length of $vec(v)$. In particular, $vec(e)_1$ and $vec(e)_2$ map to the unit circle. What's more, once we fix the unit vector $vec(e)_1$ as mapped to the vector with components $a$ and $b$ then there are only two places where $vec(e)_2$ can go if its image is to be perpendicular to the first vector's image:~it can map either to one where $vec(e)_2$ maintains its position a quarter circle clockwise from $vec(e)_1$    $Representation of (t)= ([ a -b b a ])$  or to one where it goes a quarter circle counterclockwise.    $Representation of (t)= ([ a b b -a ])$   The geometric description of these two cases is easy. Let $θ$ be the counterclockwise angle between the $x$-axis and the image of $vec(e)_1$. The first matrix above represents, with respect to the standard bases, a rotation of the plane by $θ$ radians.    $[x y] t ↓ [x cosθ-y sinθ x sinθ+y cosθ]$  The second matrix above represents a reflection of the plane through the line bisecting the angle between $vec(e)_1$ and $t(vec(e)_1)$.    $[x y]t ↓ [x cosθ+y sinθ x sinθ-y cosθ]$  (This picture shows $vec(e)_1$ reflected up into the first quadrant and $vec(e)_2$ reflected down into the fourth quadrant.)  Note: in the domain the angle between $vec(e)_1$ and $vec(e)_2$ runs counterclockwise, and in the first map above the angle from $t(vec(e)_1)$ to $t(vec(e)_2)$ is also counterclockwise, so it preserves the orientation of the angle. But the second map reverses the orientation. A distance-preserving map is direct if it preserves orientations and opposite if it reverses orientation.  With that, we have characterized the Euclidean study of congruence. It considers, for plane figures, the properties that are invariant under combinations of (i)~a rotation followed by a translation, or (ii)~a reflection followed by a translation (a reflection followed by a non-trivial translation is a glide reflection ).  Another idea encountered in elementary geometry, besides congruence of figures, is that figures are similar if they are congruent after a change of scale. The two triangles below are similar since the second is the same shape as the first but $3/2$-ths the size.    From the above work we have that figures are similar if there is an orthonormal matrix $T$ such that the points $vec(q)$ on one figure are the images of the points $vec(p)$ on the other figure by $vec(q)=(kT)vec(v)+vec(p)_0$ for some nonzero real number $k$ and constant vector $vec(p)_0$.  Although these ideas are from Euclid, mathematics is timeless and they are still in use today. One application of the maps studied above is in computer graphics. We can, for example, animate this top view of a cube by putting together film frames of it rotating; that's a rigid motion.      Frame 1 Frame 2 Frame 3   We could also make the cube appear to be moving away from us by producing film frames of it shrinking, which gives us figures that are similar.      Frame 1: Frame 2: Frame 3:   Computer graphics incorporates techniques from linear algebra in many other ways (see ).    A beautiful book that explores some of this area is . More on groups, of transformations and otherwise, is in any book on Modern Algebra, for instance . More on Klein and the Erlanger Program is in .     Decide if each of these is an orthonormal matrix.  $([ 1/√{2} -1/√{2} -1/√{2} -1/√{2} ])$ $([ 1/√{3} -1/√{3} -1/√{3} -1/√{3} ])$ $([ 1/√{3} -√{2}/√{3} -√{2}/√{3} -1/√{3} ])$    Yes. No, the columns do not have length one. Yes.    Write down the formula for each of these distance-preserving maps.  the map that rotates $π/6$ radians, and then translates by $vec(e)_2$ the map that reflects about the line $y=2x$ the map that reflects about $y=-2x$ and translates over $1$ and up $1$   Some of these are nonlinear, because they involve a nontrivial translation.   $[x y] ↦ ([ x·cos(π/6)-y·sin(π/6) x·sin(π/6)+y·cos(π/6) ]) +[0 1] =([ x·(√{3}/2)-y·(1/2)+0 x·(1/2)+y·cos(√{3}/2)+1 ])$ The line $y=2x$ makes an angle of $arctan(2/1)$ with the $x$-axis. Thus $sin(θ)=2/√{5}$ and $cos(θ)=1/√{5}$. $ [x y] ↦ ([ x·(1/√{5})-y·(2/√{5}) x·(2/√{5})+y·(1/√{5}) ]) $  $[x y] ↦ ([ x·(1/√{5})-y·(-2/√{5}) x·(-2/√{5})+y·(1/√{5}) ]) +[1 1] =([ x/√{5}+2y/√{5}+1 -2x/√{5}+y/√{5}+1 ])$     The proof that a map that is distance-preserving and sends the zero vector to itself incidentally shows that such a map is one-to-one and onto (the point in the domain determined by $d_0$, $d_1$, and $d_2$ corresponds to the point in the codomain determined by those three). Therefore any distance-preserving map has an inverse. Show that the inverse is also distance-preserving. Prove that congruence is an equivalence relation between plane figures.    Let $f$ be distance-preserving and consider $f^{-1}$. Any two points in the codomain can be written as $f(P_1)$ and $f(P_2)$. Because $f$ is distance-preserving, the distance from $f(P_1)$ to $f(P_2)$ equals the distance from $P_1$ to $P_2$. But this is exactly what is required for $f^{-1}$ to be distance-preserving. Any plane figure $F$ is congruent to itself via the identity map $I: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2$, which is obviously distance-preserving. If $F_1$ is congruent to $F_2$ (via some $f$) then $F_2$ is congruent to $F_1$ via $f^{-1}$, which is distance-preserving by the prior item. Finally, if $F_1$ is congruent to $F_2$ (via some $f$) and $F_2$ is congruent to $F_3$ (via some $g$) then $F_1$ is congruent to $F_3$ via $∘{g}{f}$, which is easily checked to be distance-preserving.    In practice the matrix for the distance-preserving linear transformation and the translation are often combined into one. Check that these two computations yield the same first two components. $ ([ a c b d ]) [x y] +[e f]  ([ a c e b d f 0 0 1 ]) [x y 1] $ (These are homogeneous coordinates ; see the Topic on Projective Geometry).  The first two components of each are $ax+cy+e$ and $bx+dy+f$.    Verify that the properties described in the second paragraph of this Topic as invariant under distance-preserving maps are indeed so. Give two more properties that are of interest in Euclidean geometry from your experience in studying that subject that are also invariant under distance-preserving maps. Give a property that is not of interest in Euclidean geometry and is not invariant under distance-preserving maps.    The Pythagorean Theorem gives that three points are collinear if and only if (for some ordering of them into $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$), $dist(P_1,P_2)+dist(P_2,P_3)=dist(P_1,P_3)$. Of course, where $f$ is distance-preserving, this holds if and only if $dist(f(P_1),f(P_2))+dist(f(P_2),f(P_3))=dist(f(P_1),f(P_3))$, which, again by Pythagoras, is true if and only if $f(P_1)$, $f(P_2)$, and $f(P_3)$ are collinear.  The argument for betweeness is similar (above, $P_2$ is between $P_1$ and $P_3$).  If the figure $F$ is a triangle then it is the union of three line segments $P_1P_2$, $P_2P_3$, and $P_1P_3$. The prior two paragraphs together show that the property of being a line segment is invariant. So $f(F)$ is the union of three line segments, and so is a triangle.  A circle $C$ centered at $P$ and of radius $r$ is the set of all points $Q$ such that $dist(P,Q)=r$. Applying the distance-preserving map $f$ gives that the image $f(C)$ is the set of all $f(Q)$ subject to the condition that $dist(P,Q)=r$. Since $dist(P,Q)=dist(f(P),f(Q))$, the set $f(C)$ is also a circle, with center $f(P)$ and radius $r$. Here are two that are easy to verify: (i)~the property of being a right triangle, and (ii)~the property of two lines being parallel. One that was mentioned in the section is the `sense' of a figure. A triangle whose vertices read clockwise as $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$ may, under a distance-preserving map, be sent to a triangle read $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$ counterclockwise.              In the first chapter we highlighted the special case of linear systems with the same number of equations as unknowns, those of the form $ Tvec(x)=vec(b) $ where $T$ is a square matrix. We noted that there are only two kinds of $T$'s. If $T$ is associated with a unique solution for any $vec(b)$, such as for the homogeneous system $Tvec(x)=0$, then $T$ is associated with a unique solution for every such $vec(b)$. We call such a matrix nonsingular. The other kind of $T$, where every linear system for which it is the matrix of coefficients has either no solution or infinitely many solutions, we call singular.  In our work since then this distinction has been a theme. For instance, we now know that an $ N by N $ matrix $ T $ is nonsingular if and only if each of these holds:   any system $ Tvec(x)=vec(b) $ has a solution and that solution is unique; Gauss-Jordan reduction of $T$ yields an identity matrix; the rows of $T$ form a linearly independent set; the columns of $ T $ form a linearly independent set, a basis for $ ℝ^n $; any map that $ T $ represents is an isomorphism; an inverse matrix $ T^{-1} $ exists.   So when we look at a square matrix, one of the first things that we ask is whether it is nonsingular.  This chapter develops a formula that determines whether $T$ is nonsingular. More precisely, we will develop a formula for $N by N$~matrices, one for $N by N$~matrices, etc. These are naturally related; that is, we will develop a family of formulas, a scheme that describes the formula for each size.  Since we will restrict the discussion to square matrices, in this chapter we will often simply say `matrix' in place of `square matrix'.      section{Def{}inition}  Determining nonsingularity is trivial for $ N by N $ matrices. $ ([ a ]) is nonsingular iff a ≠ 0 $ Corollary~Three.IV. gives the $N by N$ formula. $ ([ a b c d ]) is nonsingular iff ad-bc ≠ 0 $ We can produce the $N by N$ formula as we did the prior one, although the computation is intricate   (see ). $ ([ a b c d e f g h i ]) is nonsingular iff aei+bfg+cdh-hfa-idb-gec ≠ 0 $ With these cases in mind, we posit a family of formulas: $a$, $ad-bc$, etc. For each $n$ the formula defines a determinant function $map{det(_){N by N}}{matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ}$ such that an $N by N$ matrix $T$ is nonsingular if and only if $det(_){N by N}(T) ≠ 0$.  (We usually omit the subscript $ N by N $ because the size of $ T $ describes which determinant function we mean.)        textit{This subsection is an optional motivation and development of the general definition. The definition is in the next subsection.}  Above, in each case the matrix is nonsingular if and only if some formula is nonzero. But the three formulas don't show an obvious pattern. We may spot that the $N by N$ term $ a $ has one letter, that the $N by N$ terms $ad$ and $bc$ have two letters, and that the $N by N$ terms each have three letters. We may even spot that in those terms there is a letter from each row and column of the matrix, e.g., in the $cdh$ term one letter comes from each row and from each column. $ ([ c d h ]) $ But these observations are perhaps more puzzling than enlightening. For instance, we might wonder why some terms are added but some are subtracted.  A good strategy for solving problems is to explore which properties the solution must have, and then search for something with those properties. So we shall start by asking what properties we'd like the determinant formulas to have.  At this point, our main way to decide whether a matrix is singular or not is to do Gaussian reduction and then check whether the diagonal of the echelon form matrix has any zeroes, that is, whether the product down the diagonal is~zero. So we could guess that whatever determinant formula we find, the proof that it is right may involve applying Gauss's Method to the matrix to show that in the end the product down the diagonal is zero if and only if our formula gives zero.  This suggests a plan:~we will look for a family of determinant formulas that are unaffected by row operations and such that the determinant of an echelon form matrix is the product of its diagonal entries.       In the rest of this subsection we will test this plan against the $N by N$ and $N by N$ formulas. In the end we will have to modify the ``unaffected by row operations'' part, but not by much.  First we check whether the $N by N$ and $N by N$ formulas are unaffected by the row operation of combining:~if $ T for step $kρ_i+ρ_j$ T̂ $ then is $ det(T̂)=det(T) $? This check of the $N by N$ determinant after the $kρ_1+ρ_2$ operation $ det( ([ a b ka+c kb+d ]) ) = a(kb+d)-(ka+c)b = ad-bc $ shows that it is indeed unchanged, and the other $N by N$ combination $kρ_2+ρ_1$ gives the same result. Likewise, the $N by N$ combination $kρ_3+ρ_2$ leaves the determinant unchanged $ det( ([ a b c kg+d kh+e ki+f g h i ]) ) =$[t] a(kh+e)i+b(ki+f)g+c(kg+d)h -h(ki+f)a-i(kg+d)b-g(kh+e)c $ =aei + bfg + cdh - hfa - idb - gec $ as do the other $N by N$ row combination operations.  So there seems to be promise in the plan. Of course, perhaps if we had worked out the $N by N$ determinant formula and tested it then we might have found that it is affected by row combinations. This is an exploration and we do not yet have all the facts. Nonetheless, so far, so good.  Next we compare $ det(T̂) $ with $ det(T) $ for row swaps.    Here we hit a snag: the $N by N$ row swap $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ does not yield $ ad-bc $. $ det( ([ c d a b ]) ) = bc - ad $ And this $ρ_1↔ρ_3$ swap inside of a $N by N$ matrix $ det( ([ g h i d e f a b c ]) ) = gec + hfa + idb - bfg - cdh - aei $ also does not give the same determinant as before the swap since again there is a sign change. Trying a different $N by N$ swap $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ $ det( ([ d e f a b c g h i ]) ) = dbi + ecg + fah - hcd - iae - gbf $ also gives a change of sign.  So row swaps appear in this experiment to change the sign of a determinant. This does not wreck our plan entirely. We hope to decide nonsingularity by considering only whether the formula gives zero, not by considering its sign. Therefore, instead of expecting determinant formulas to be entirely unaffected by row operations we modify our plan so that on a swap they will change sign.  Obviously we finish by comparing $ det(T̂) $ with $ det(T) $ for the operation    of multiplying a row by a scalar. This $ det( ([ a b kc kd ]) ) = a(kd) - (kc)b =k· (ad-bc) $ ends with the entire determinant multiplied by~$k$, and the other $N by N$ case has the same result. This $N by N$ case ends the same way $ det( ([ a b c d e f kg kh ki ]) ) = $[t] ae(ki) + bf(kg) + cd(kh) - (kh)fa - (ki)db - (kg)ec $ = k·(aei + bfg + cdh - hfa - idb - gec) $ as do the other two $N by N$ cases. These make us suspect that multiplying a row by~$k$ multiplies the determinant by~$k$. As before, this modifies our plan but does not wreck it. We are asking only that the zero-ness of the determinant formula be unchanged, not focusing on the its sign or magnitude.  So in this exploration out plan got modified in some inessential ways and is now:~we will look for $N by N$ determinant functions that remain unchanged under the operation of row combination, that change sign on a row swap, that rescale on the rescaling of a row, and such that the determinant of an echelon form matrix is the product down the diagonal. In the next two subsections we will see that for each~$n$ there is one and only one such function.  Finally, for the next subsection note that factoring out scalars is a row-wise operation: here $ det( ([ 3 3 9 2 1 1 5 11 -5 ]) ) =3 · det( ([ 1 1 3 2 1 1 5 11 -5 ]) ) $ the $3$ comes only out of the top row only, leaving the other rows unchanged. Consequently in the definition of determinant we will write it as a function of the rows $ det(vec(ρ)_1,vec(ρ)_2,...vec(ρ)_n) $, rather than as $ det(T) $ or as a function of the entries $ det(t_{1,1},...,t_{n,n}) $.    Evaluate the determinant of each.  $ ([ 3 1 -1 1 ]) $ $ ([ 2 0 1 3 1 1 -1 0 1 ]) $ $ ([ 4 0 1 0 0 1 1 3 -1 ]) $    $ 4 $ $ 3 $ $ -12 $    Evaluate the determinant of each.  $ ([ 2 0 -1 3 ]) $ $ ([ 2 1 1 0 5 -2 1 -3 4 ]) $ $ ([ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 ]) $    $ 6 $ $ 21 $ $ 27 $    Verify that the determinant of an upper-triangular $N by N$ matrix is the product down the diagonal. $ det( ([ a b c 0 e f 0 0 i ]) ) =aei $ Do lower-triangular matrices work the same way?  For the first, apply the formula in this section, note that any term with a $ d $, $ g $, or $ h $ is zero, and simplify. Lower-triangular matrices work the same way.   Use the determinant to decide if each is singular or nonsingular.  $ ([ 2 1 3 1 ]) $ $ ([ 0 1 1 -1 ]) $ $ ([ 4 2 2 1 ]) $    Nonsingular, the determinant is $ -1 $. Nonsingular, the determinant is $ -1 $. Singular, the determinant is $ 0 $.    Singular or nonsingular? Use the determinant to decide.  $ ([ 2 1 1 3 2 2 0 1 4 ]) $ $ ([ 1 0 1 2 1 1 4 1 3 ]) $ $ ([ 2 1 0 3 -2 0 1 0 0 ]) $    Nonsingular, the determinant is $ 3 $. Singular, the determinant is $ 0 $. Singular, the determinant is $ 0 $.    Each pair of matrices differ by one row operation. Use this operation to compare $ det(A) $ with $ det(B) $.  $ A=([ 1 2 2 3 ]) $ $ B=([ 1 2 0 -1 ]) $ $ A=([ 3 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 2 ]) $ $ B=([ 3 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 ]) $ $ A=([ 1 -1 3 2 2 -6 1 0 4 ]) $ $ B=([ 1 -1 3 1 1 -3 1 0 4 ]) $    $ det(B)=det(A) $ via $ -2ρ_1+ρ_2 $ $ det(B)=-det(A) $ via $ ρ_2↔ρ_3 $ $ det(B)=(1/2)· det(A) $ via $ (1/2)ρ_2 $    Show this. $ det( ([ 1 1 1 a b c a^2 b^2 c^2 ]) ) =(b-a)(c-a)(c-b) $  Using the formula for the determinant of a $N by N$ matrix we expand the left side $ 1· b· c^2+1· c· a^2+1· a· b^2 -b^2· c· 1 -c^2· a· 1-a^2· b· 1 $ and by distributing we expand the right side. $ (bc-ba-ac+a^2)·(c-b) =c^2b-b^2c-bac+b^2a-ac^2+acb+a^2c-a^2b $ Now we can just check that the two are equal. (Remark. This is the $ N by N $ case of Vandermonde's determinant which arises in applications).   Which real numbers $ x $ make this matrix singular? $ ([ 12-x 4 8 8-x ]) $  This equation $ 0= det( ([ 12-x 4 8 8-x ]) ) =64-20x+x^2 =(x-16)(x-4) $ has roots $ x=16 $ and $ x=4 $.   Do the Gaussian reduction to check the formula for $N by N$ matrices stated in the preamble to this section.  $ ([ a b c d e f g h i ]) $ is nonsingular iff $ aei+bfg+cdh-hfa-idb-gec ≠ 0 $   We first reduce the matrix to echelon form. To begin, assume that $ a ≠ 0 $ and that $ ae-bd ≠ 0 $. $ for step $(1/a)ρ_1$ ([ 1 b/a c/a d e f g h i ]) for step $-dρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 (ae-bd)/a (af-cd)/a 0 (ah-bg)/a (ai-cg)/a ]) for step $(a/(ae-bd))ρ_2$ ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 1 (af-cd)/(ae-bd) 0 (ah-bg)/a (ai-cg)/a ]) $ This step finishes the calculation. $ for step $((ah-bg)/a)ρ_2+ρ_3$ ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 1 (af-cd)/(ae-bd) 0 0 (aei+bgf+cdh-hfa-idb-gec)/(ae-bd) ]) $ Now assuming that $a ≠ 0$ and $ ae-bd ≠ 0 $, the original matrix is nonsingular if and only if the $ 3,3 $ entry above is nonzero. That is, under the assumptions, the original matrix is nonsingular if and only if $aei+bgf+cdh-hfa-idb-gec ≠ 0$, as required.  We finish by running down what happens if the assumptions that were taken for convenience in the prior paragraph do not hold. First, if $ a ≠ 0 $ but $ ae-bd=0 $ then we can swap $ ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 0 (af-cd)/a 0 (ah-bg)/a (ai-cg)/a ]) for step $ρ_2↔ρ_3$ ([ 1 b/a c/a 0 (ah-bg)/a (ai-cg)/a 0 0 (af-cd)/a ]) $ and conclude that the matrix is nonsingular if and only if either $ ah-bg=0 $ or $ af-cd=0 $. The condition `$ ah-bg=0 $ or $ af-cd=0 $' is equivalent to the condition `$ (ah-bg)(af-cd)=0 $'. Multiplying out and using the case assumption that $ae-bd=0$ to substitute $ae$ for $bd$ gives this. $ 0=ahaf-ahcd-bgaf+bgcd =ahaf-ahcd-bgaf+aegc =a(haf-hcd-bgf+egc) $ Since $ a ≠ 0 $, we have that the matrix is nonsingular if and only if $ haf-hcd-bgf+egc=0 $. Therefore, in this $ a ≠ 0 $ and $ ae-bd=0 $ case, the matrix is nonsingular when $ haf-hcd-bgf+egc-i(ae-bd)=0 $.  The remaining cases are routine. Do the $ a=0 $ but $ d ≠ 0 $ case and the $ a=0 $ and $ d=0 $ but $ g ≠ 0 $ case by first swapping rows and then going on as above. The $ a=0 $, $ d=0 $, and $ g=0 $ case is easy- that matrix is singular since the columns form a linearly dependent set, and the determinant comes out to be zero.   Show that the equation of a line in $ ℝ^2 $ thru $ (x_1,y_1) $ and $ (x_2,y_2) $ is given by this determinant. $ det( ([ x y 1 x_1 y_1 1 x_2 y_2 1 ]))=0 x_1 ≠ x_2 $  Figuring the determinant and doing some algebra gives this. $ 0 =y_1x+x_2y+x_1y_2-y_2x-x_1y-x_2y_1 (x_2-x_1)· y =(y_2-y_1)· x+x_2y_1-x_1y_2 y =(y_2-y_1/x_2-x_1)· x+(x_2y_1-x_1y_2/x_2-x_1) $ Note that this is the equation of a line (in particular, in contains the familiar expression for the slope), and note that $ (x_1,y_1) $ and $ (x_2,y_2) $ satisfy it.   Many people know this mnemonic for the determinant of a $ N by N $ matrix: first repeat the first two columns and then sum the products on the forward diagonals and subtract the products on the backward diagonals. That is, first write $ ([ h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{1,3} h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{3,1} h_{3,2} h_{3,3} h_{3,1} h_{3,2} ]) $ and then calculate this. $ $ h_{1,1}h_{2,2}h_{3,3}+h_{1,2}h_{2,3}h_{3,1}+h_{1,3}h_{2,1}h_{3,2} -h_{3,1}h_{2,2}h_{1,3}-h_{3,2}h_{2,3}h_{1,1} -h_{3,3}h_{2,1}h_{1,2} $ $  Check that this agrees with the formula given in the preamble to this section. Does it extend to other-sized determinants?    The comparison with the formula given in the preamble to this section is easy. While it holds for $ N by N $ matrices $ ([ h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{1,1} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,1} ]) =$[t] h_{1,1}h_{2,2}+h_{1,2}h_{2,1} -h_{2,1}h_{1,2}-h_{2,2}h_{1,1} $ =h_{1,1}h_{2,2}-h_{1,2}h_{2,1} $ it does not hold for $ N by N $ matrices. An example is that this matrix is singular because the second and third rows are equal $ ([ 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 -1 0 0 1 ]) $ but following the scheme of the mnemonic does not give zero. $ ([ 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 -1 0 0 1 -1 0 0 ]) =$[t] 1+0+0+0 -(-1)-0-0-0 $ $    The cross product of the vectors $ vec(x)=[x_1 x_2 x_3]  vec(y)=[y_1 y_2 y_3] $ is the vector computed as this determinant. $ vec(x)×vec(y)= det(([ vec(e)_1 vec(e)_2 vec(e)_3 x_1 x_2 x_3 y_1 y_2 y_3 ])) $ Note that the first row's entries are vectors, the vectors from the standard basis for $ ℝ^3$. Show that the cross product of two vectors is perpendicular to each vector.  The determinant is $ (x_2y_3-x_3y_2)vec(e)_1 +(x_3y_1-x_1y_3)vec(e)_2 +(x_1y_2-x_2y_1)vec(e)_3 $. To check perpendicularity, we check that the dot product with the first vector is zero $ [x_1 x_2 x_3] dot product of [x_2y_3-x_3y_2 x_3y_1-x_1y_3 x_1y_2-x_2y_1] =x_1x_2y_3-x_1x_3y_2+x_2x_3y_1-x_1x_2y_3+x_1x_3y_2-x_2x_3y_1=0 $ and the dot product with the second vector is also zero. $ [y_1 y_2 y_3] dot product of [x_2y_3-x_3y_2 x_3y_1-x_1y_3 x_1y_2-x_2y_1] =x_2y_1y_3-x_3y_1y_2+x_3y_1y_2-x_1y_2y_3+x_1y_2y_3-x_2y_1y_3=0 $   Prove that each statement holds for $N by N$ matrices.  The determinant of a product is the product of the determinants $det(ST)=det(S)·det(T)$. If $ T $ is invertible then the determinant of the inverse is the inverse of the determinant $ det(T^{-1})=(det(T))^{-1} $.  Matrices $T$ and $T^prime$ are similar if there is a nonsingular matrix $P$ such that $T^prime=PTP^{-1}$. (We shall look at this relationship in Chapter Five.) Show that similar $ N by N $ matrices have the same determinant.   Plug and chug: the determinant of the product is this $ det(([ a b c d ]) ([ w x y z ]) ) = det(([ aw+by ax+bz cw+dy cx+dz ]) ) = $[t] acwx+adwz+bcxy+bdyz -acwx-bcwz-adxy-bdyz $ $ while the product of the determinants is this. $ det(([ a b c d ])) ·det(([ w x y z ])) = (ad-bc)· (wz-xy) $ Verification that they are equal is easy. Use the prior item.  That similar matrices have the same determinant is immediate from the above two: $ det(PTP^{-1})=det(P)·det(T)·det(P^{-1}) $.   Prove that the area of this region in the plane    is equal to the value of this determinant. $ det( ([ x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2 ])) $ Compare with this. $ det( ([ x_2 x_1 y_2 y_1 ])) $  One way is to count these areas    by taking the area of the entire rectangle and subtracting the area of $A$ the upper-left rectangle, $B$ the upper-middle triangle, $D$ the upper-right triangle, $C$ the lower-left triangle, $E$ the lower-middle triangle, and $F$ the lower-right rectangle $ (x_1+x_2)(y_1+y_2)-x_2y_1-(1/2)x_1y_1-(1/2)x_2y_2 -(1/2)x_2y_2-(1/2)x_1y_1-x_2y_1 $. Simplification gives the determinant formula.  This determinant is the negative of the one above; the formula distinguishes whether the second column is counterclockwise from the first.   Prove that for $ N by N $ matrices, the determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its transpose. Does that also hold for $ N by N $ matrices?  The computation for $ N by N $ matrices, using the formula quoted in the preamble, is easy. It does also hold for $ N by N $ matrices; the computation is routine.   Is the determinant function linear - is $ det(x· T+y· S)=x· det(T)+y· det(S) $?  No. Recall that constants come out one row at a time. $ det( ([ 2 4 2 6 ])) = 2·det(([ 1 2 2 6 ])) = 2· 2· det(([ 1 2 1 3 ])) $ This contradicts linearity (here we didn't need $ S $, i.e., we can take $S$ to be the matrix of zeros).   Show that if $ A $ is $ N by N $ then $ det(c· A)=c^3· det(A) $ for any scalar $ c $.  Bring out the $ c $'s one row at a time.   Which real numbers $ θ $ make $ ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) sin(θ) cos(θ) ]) $ singular? Explain geometrically.  There are no real numbers $ θ $ that make the matrix singular because the determinant of the matrix $ cos^2(θ+)sin^2(θ) $ is never $0$, it equals $1$ for all $θ$. Geometrically, with respect to the standard basis, this matrix represents a rotation of the plane through an angle of $ θ $. Each such map is one-to-one - for one thing, it is invertible.    If a third order determinant has elements $ 1 $, $ 2 $, ..., $ 9 $, what is the maximum value it may have?   Let $ P $ be the sum of the three positive terms of the determinant and $ -N $ the sum of the three negative terms. The maximum value of $ P $ is $ 9· 8· 7 +6· 5· 4 +3· 2· 1=630. $ The minimum value of $ N $ consistent with $ P $ is $ 9· 6· 1 +8· 5· 2 +7· 4· 3=218. $ Any change in $ P $ would result in lowering that sum by more than $ 4 $. Therefore $ 412 $ the maximum value for the determinant and one form for the determinant is $ ([ 9 4 2 3 8 6 5 1 7 ]). $                         We want a formula to determine whether an $N by N$ matrix is nonsingular. We will not begin by stating such a formula. Instead we will begin by considering the function that such a formula calculates. We will define this function by its properties, then prove that the function with these properties exists and is unique, and also describe how to compute it. (Because we will eventually show that the function exists and is unique, from the start we will just say `$ det(T) $' instead of `if there is a unique determinant function then $ det(T) $'.)    A $ N by N $ determinant is a function $ map(\det){matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ} $ such that   $ det(vec(ρ)_1,...,k·vec(ρ)_i + vec(ρ)_j,...,vec(ρ)_n) =det(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(ρ)_j,...,vec(ρ)_n) $ for $ ine(j) $  $ det(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(ρ)_j, ...,vec(ρ)_i,...,vec(ρ)_n) = -det(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(ρ)_i,...,vec(ρ)_j, ...,vec(ρ)_n) $ for $ ine(j)$  $ det(vec(ρ)_1,...,kvec(ρ)_i,...,vec(ρ)_n) = k· det(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(ρ)_i,...,vec(ρ)_n) $ for any scalar~$k$   $ det(I)=1 $ where $ I $ is an identity matrix  (the $vec(ρ)$'s are the rows of the matrix). We often write $ determinant(T) $ for $ det(T) $.      Condition~(2) is redundant since $ Tfor step $ρ_i+ρ_j$ repeat step $-ρ_j+ρ_i$ repeat step $ρ_i+ρ_j$ repeat step $-ρ_i$ T̂ $ swaps rows $ i $ and~$ j $. We have listed it for consistency with the Gauss's Method presentation in earlier chapters.     Condition~(3) does not have a $k ≠ 0$ restriction, although the Gauss's Method operation of multiplying a row by~$k$ does have it.  The next result shows that we do not need that restriction here.             A matrix with two identical rows has a determinant of zero. A matrix with a zero row has a determinant of zero. A matrix is nonsingular if and only if its determinant is nonzero. The determinant of an echelon form matrix is the product down its diagonal.      To verify the first sentence swap the two equal rows. The sign of the determinant changes but the matrix is the same and so its determinant is the same. Thus the determinant is zero.    For the second sentence multiply the zero row by two. That doubles the determinant but it also leaves the row unchanged, and hence leaves the determinant unchanged. Thus the determinant must be zero.    Do Gauss-Jordan reduction for the third sentence, $T ->·s->T̂$. By the first three properties the determinant of $T$ is zero if and only if the determinant of $T̂$ is zero (although the two could differ in sign or magnitude). A nonsingular matrix $T$ Gauss-Jordan reduces to an identity matrix and so has a nonzero determinant. A singular $T$ reduces to a $T̂$ with a zero row; by the second sentence of this lemma its determinant is zero.    The fourth sentence has two cases. If the echelon form matrix is singular then it has a zero row. Thus it has a zero on its diagonal and the product down its diagonal is zero. By the third sentence of this result the determinant is zero and therefore this matrix's determinant equals the product down its diagonal.    If the echelon form matrix is nonsingular then none of its diagonal entries is zero. This means that we can divide by those entries and use condition~(3) to get $1$'s on the diagonal. $ ([ t_{1,1} t_{1,2} t_{1,n} 0 t_{2,2} t_{2,n} ... 0 t_{n,n} ]) = t_{1,1}· t_{2,2}·s t_{n,n}· ([ 1 t_{1,2}/t_{1,1} t_{1,n}/t_{1,1} 0 1 t_{2,n}/t_{2,2} ... 0 1 ]) $ Then the Jordan half of Gauss-Jordan elimination leaves the identity matrix. $ = t_{1,1}· t_{2,2}·s t_{n,n}· ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 ... 0 1 ]) = t_{1,1}· t_{2,2}·s t_{n,n}· 1 $ So in this case also, the determinant is the product down the diagonal.    That gives us a way to compute the value of a determinant function on a matrix: do Gaussian reduction, keeping track of any changes of sign caused by row swaps and any scalars that we factor out, and finish by multiplying down the diagonal of the echelon form result. This algorithm is as fast as Gauss's Method and so is practical on all of the matrices that we will see.  For example Doing $ N by N $ determinants with Gauss's Method $ ([ 2 4 -1 3 ]) = ([ 2 4 0 5 ]) =10 $ doesn't give a big time savings because the $N by N$ determinant formula is easy. However, a $ N by N $ determinant is often easier to calculate with Gauss's Method than with its formula. $ ([ 2 2 6 4 4 3 0 -3 5 ]) = ([ 2 2 6 0 0 -9 0 -3 5 ]) = -([ 2 2 6 0 -3 5 0 0 -9 ]) =-54 $   For example Determinants bigger than $N by N$ go quickly with the Gauss's Method procedure. $ ([ 1 0 1 3 0 1 1 4 0 0 0 5 0 1 0 1 ]) = ([ 1 0 1 3 0 1 1 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 -1 -3 ]) = -([ 1 0 1 3 0 1 1 4 0 0 -1 -3 0 0 0 5 ]) =-(-5)=5 $   The prior example illustrates an important point. Although we have not yet found a $N by N$ determinant formula, if one exists then we know what value it gives to the matrix - if there is a function with properties (1)-(4) then on the above matrix the function must return $5$.    For each $n$, if there is an $N by N$ determinant function then it is unique.      Perform Gauss's Method on the matrix, keeping track of how the sign alternates on row swaps and any row-scaling factors, and then multiply down the diagonal of the echelon form result. By the definition and the lemma, all $N by N$ determinant functions must return this value on the matrix.    The `if there is an $N by N$ determinant function' emphasizes that, although we can use Gauss's Method to compute the only value that a determinant function could possibly return, we haven't yet shown that such a function exists for all $n$. The rest of this section does that.   [{m For these, assume that an $N by N$ determinant function exists for all $n$.}]  Use Gauss's Method to find each determinant.  $ ([ 3 1 2 3 1 0 0 1 4 ]) $ $ ([ 1 0 0 1 2 1 1 0 -1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 ]) $    $ ([ 3 1 2 3 1 0 0 1 4 ]) = ([ 3 1 2 0 0 -2 0 1 4 ]) = -([ 3 1 2 0 1 4 0 0 -2 ]) =6 $ $ ([ 1 0 0 1 2 1 1 0 -1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 ]) = ([ 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 -2 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 -1 ]) = ([ 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 -2 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 ]) =1 $   Use Gauss's Method to find each.  $ ([ 2 -1 -1 -1 ]) $ $ ([ 1 1 0 3 0 2 5 2 2 ]) $    $ ([ 2 -1 -1 -1 ]) =([ 2 -1 0 -3/2 ])=-3 $; $ ([ 1 1 0 3 0 2 5 2 2 ]) =([ 1 1 0 0 -3 2 0 -3 2 ]) =([ 1 1 0 0 -3 2 0 0 0 ]) =0 $    For which values of $ k $ does this system have a unique solution? $ $ x + z - w = 2 y - 2z = 3 x + kz = 4 z - w = 2 $ $  When is the determinant not zero? $ ([ 1 0 1 -1 0 1 -2 0 1 0 k 0 0 0 1 -1 ]) = ([ 1 0 1 -1 0 1 -2 0 0 0 k-1 1 0 0 1 -1 ]) $ Obviously, $k=1$ gives nonsingularity and hence a nonzero determinant. If $k ≠ 1$ then we get echelon form with a $(-1/k-1)ρ_3+ρ_4$ combination. $ = ([ 1 0 1 -1 0 1 -2 0 0 0 k-1 1 0 0 0 -1-(1/k-1) ]) $ Multiplying down the diagonal gives $(k-1)(-1-(1/k-1))=-(k-1)-1=-k$. Thus the matrix has a nonzero determinant, and so the system has a unique solution, if and only if $ k ≠ 0 $.   Express each of these in terms of $ determinant(H) $.  $ ([ h_{3,1} h_{3,2} h_{3,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{1,3} ]) $ $ ([ -h_{1,1} -h_{1,2} -h_{1,3} -2h_{2,1} -2h_{2,2} -2h_{2,3} -3h_{3,1} -3h_{3,2} -3h_{3,3} ]) $ $ ([ h_{1,1}+h_{3,1} h_{1,2}+h_{3,2} h_{1,3}+h_{3,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} 5h_{3,1} 5h_{3,2} 5h_{3,3} ]) $    Condition~(2) of the definition of determinants applies via the swap $ρ_1↔ρ_3$. $ ([ h_{3,1} h_{3,2} h_{3,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{1,3} ]) = -([ h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{1,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} h_{3,1} h_{3,2} h_{3,3} ]) $ Condition~(3) applies. $ ([ -h_{1,1} -h_{1,2} -h_{1,3} -2h_{2,1} -2h_{2,2} -2h_{2,3} -3h_{3,1} -3h_{3,2} -3h_{3,3} ]) = (-1)·(-2)·(-3)· ([ h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{1,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} h_{3,1} h_{3,2} h_{3,3} ]) = (-6)· ([ h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{1,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} h_{3,1} h_{3,2} h_{3,3} ]) $  $ ([ h_{1,1}+h_{3,1} h_{1,2}+h_{3,2} h_{1,3}+h_{3,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} 5h_{3,1} 5h_{3,2} 5h_{3,3} ]) $ = 5· ([ h_{1,1}+h_{3,1} h_{1,2}+h_{3,2} h_{1,3}+h_{3,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} h_{3,1} h_{3,2} h_{3,3} ]) =5· ([ h_{1,1} h_{1,2} h_{1,3} h_{2,1} h_{2,2} h_{2,3} h_{3,1} h_{3,2} h_{3,3} ]) $ $    Find the determinant of a diagonal matrix.  A diagonal matrix is in echelon form, so the determinant is the product down the diagonal.   Describe the solution set of a homogeneous linear system if the determinant of the matrix of coefficients is nonzero.  It is the trivial subspace.   Show that this determinant is zero. $ ([ y+z x+z x+y x y z 1 1 1 ]) $  Adding the second row to the first gives a matrix whose first row is $x+y+z$ times its third row.    Find the $N by N$, $N by N$, and $N by N$ matrices with $i,j$ entry given by $(-1)^{i+j}$. Find the determinant of the square matrix with $ i,j $ entry $ (-1)^{i+j} $.     $([ 1 ])$, $([ 1 -1 -1 1 ])$, $([ 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 ])$ The determinant in the $N by N$ case is $1$. In every other case the second row is the negative of the first, and so matrix is singular and the determinant is zero.     Find the $N by N$, $N by N$, and $N by N$ matrices with $i,j$ entry given by $i+j$. Find the determinant of the square matrix with $i,j$ entry $i+j$.     $([ 2 ])$, $([ 2 3 3 4 ])$, $([ 2 3 4 3 4 5 4 5 6 ])$ The $N by N$ and $N by N$ cases yield these. $ ([ 2 ]) =2  ([ 2 3 3 4 ])=-1 $ And $N by N$ matrices with $n≥ 3$ are singular, e.g., $ ([ 2 3 4 3 4 5 4 5 6 ])=0 $ because twice the second row minus the first row equals the third row. Checking this is routine.    Show that determinant functions are not linear by giving a case where $ determinant(A+B) ≠determinant(A)+determinant(B) $.  This one $ A=B= ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) $ is easy to check. $ determinant(A+B) = ([ 2 4 6 8 ]) =-8  determinant(A)+determinant(B) = -2-2 =-4 $ By the way, this also gives an example where scalar multiplication is not preserved $determinant(2· A) ≠ 2·determinant(A)$.   The second condition in the definition, that row swaps change the sign of a determinant, is somewhat annoying. It means we have to keep track of the number of swaps, to compute how the sign alternates. Can we get rid of it? Can we replace it with the condition that row swaps leave the determinant unchanged? (If so then we would need new $N by N$, $N by N$, and $N by N$ formulas, but that would be a minor matter.)  No, we cannot replace it.  shows that the four conditions after the replacement would conflict - no function satisfies all four.   Prove that the determinant of any triangular matrix, upper or lower, is the product down its diagonal.  A upper-triangular matrix is in echelon form.  A lower-triangular matrix is either singular or nonsingular. If it is singular then it has a zero on its diagonal and so its determinant (namely, zero) is indeed the product down its diagonal. If it is nonsingular then it has no zeroes on its diagonal, and we can reduce it by Gauss's Method to echelon form without changing the diagonal.   Refer to the definition of elementary matrices in the Mechanics of Matrix Multiplication subsection.  What is the determinant of each kind of elementary matrix? Prove that if $ E $ is any elementary matrix then $ determinant(ES)=determinant(E)determinant(S) $ for any appropriately sized $ S $. (This question doesn't involve determinants.) Prove that if $ T $ is singular then a product $ TS $ is also singular. Show that $ determinant(TS)=determinant(T)determinant(S) $. Show that if $ T $ is nonsingular then $ deter{T^{-1}}=determinant(T)^{-1} $.    The properties in the definition of determinant show that $ determinant(M_i(k))=k $, $ deter{P_{i,j}}=-1 $, and $ deter{C_{i,j}(k)}=1 $. The three cases are easy to check by recalling the action of left multiplication by each type of matrix. If $ TS $ is invertible $ (TS)M=I $ then the associative property of matrix multiplication $ T(SM)=I $ shows that $ T $ is invertible. So if $ T $ is not invertible then neither is $ TS $. If $ T $ is singular then apply the prior answer: $ determinant(TS)=0 $ and $ determinant(T)·determinant(S)=0·determinant(S)=0 $. If $ T $ is not singular then we can write it as a product of elementary matrices $ determinant(TS)=determinant(E_r·s E_1S)= determinant(E_r)·sdeterminant(E_1)·determinant(S)= determinant(E_r·s E_1)determinant(S)=determinant(T)determinant(S) $. $ 1=determinant(I)=deter{T· T^{-1}} =determinant(T)deter{T^{-1}} $    Prove that the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants $ determinant(TS)=determinant(T)determinant(S) $ in this way. Fix the $ N by N $ matrix $ S $ and consider the function $ map(d){matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ} $ given by $ T↦ determinant(TS)/determinant(S) $.  Check that $ d $ satisfies condition~(1) in the definition of a determinant function. Check condition~(2). Check condition~(3). Check condition~(4). Conclude the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants.    We must show that if $ Tfor step $kρ_i+ρ_j$T̂ $ then $d(T)=determinant(TS)/determinant(S) =deter(T̂S)/determinant(S)=d(T̂)$. We will be done if we show that combining rows first and then multiplying to get $ T̂S $ gives the same result as multiplying first to get $ TS $ and then combining (because the determinant $ determinant(TS) $ is unaffected by the combination so we'll then have $ deter(T̂S)=determinant(TS) $, and hence $ d(T̂)=d(T) $). That argument runs:~after adding $ k $ times row~$ i $ of $ TS $ to row~$j$ of $ TS $, the $ j,p $ entry is $ (kt_{i,1}+t_{j,1})s_{1,p}+...+(kt_{i,r}+t_{j,r})s_{r,p} $, which is the $ j,p $ entry of $ T̂S $. We need only show that swapping $ Tsmash[b]{for step $ρ_i ↔ ρ_j$}T̂ $ and then multiplying to get $ T̂S $ gives the same result as multiplying $ T $ by $ S $ and then swapping (because, as the determinant $ determinant(TS) $ changes sign on the row swap, we'll then have $ deter(T̂S)=-determinant(TS) $, and so $ d(T̂)=-d(T) $). That argument runs just like the prior one. Not surprisingly by now, we need only show that multiplying a row by a scalar $ Tsmash[b]{for step $kρ_i$}T̂ $ and then computing $ T̂S $ gives the same result as first computing $ TS $ and then multiplying the row by $ k $ (as the determinant $ determinant(TS) $ is rescaled by $ k $ the multiplication, we'll have $ deter(T̂S)=kdeterminant(TS) $, so $ d(T̂)=kd(T) $). The argument runs just as above. Clear. Because we've shown that $ d(T) $ is a determinant and that determinant functions (if they exist) are unique, we have that so $ determinant(T)=d(T)=determinant(TS)/determinant(S) $.    A submatrix of a given matrix $A$ is one that we get by deleting some of the rows and columns of $A$. Thus, the first matrix here is a submatrix of the second. $ ([ 3 1 2 5 ])  ([ 3 4 1 0 9 -2 2 -1 5 ]) $ Prove that for any square matrix, the rank of the matrix is $r$ if and only if $ r $ is the largest integer such that there is an $ N by r $ submatrix with a nonzero determinant.  We will first argue that a rank $ r $ matrix has a $ N by r $ submatrix with nonzero determinant. A rank $ r $ matrix has a linearly independent set of $ r $ rows. A matrix made from those rows will have row rank $ r $ and thus has column rank $ r $. Conclusion: from those $ r $ rows we can extract a linearly independent set of $ r $ columns, and so the original matrix has a $ N by r $ submatrix of rank $ r $.  We finish by showing that if $ r $ is the largest such integer then the rank of the matrix is $ r $. We need only show, by the maximality of $ r $, that if a matrix has a $ N by k $ submatrix of nonzero determinant then the rank of the matrix is at least $ k $. Consider such a $ N by k $ submatrix. Its rows are parts of the rows of the original matrix, clearly the set of whole rows is linearly independent. Thus the row rank of the original matrix is at least $ k $, and the row rank of a matrix equals its rank.   Prove that a matrix with rational entries has a rational determinant.  A matrix with only rational entries reduces with Gauss's Method to an echelon form matrix using only rational arithmetic. Thus the entries on the diagonal must be rationals, and so the product down the diagonal is rational.    Find the element of likeness in (a)~simplifying a fraction, (b)~powdering the nose, (c)~building new steps on the church, (d)~keeping emeritus professors on campus, (e)~putting $ B $, $ C $, $ D $ in the determinant $ ([ 1 a a^2 a^3 a^3 1 a a^2 B a^3 1 a C D a^3 1 ]). $   The value $ (1-a^4)^3 $ of the determinant is independent of the values $ B $, $ C $, $ D $. Hence operation~(e) does not change the value of the determinant but merely changes its appearance. Thus the element of likeness in (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) is only that the appearance of the principle entity is changed. The same element appears in (f)~changing the name-label of a rose, (g)~writing a decimal integer in the scale of $ 12 $, (h)~gilding the lily, (i)~whitewashing a politician, and (j)~granting an honorary degree.                       The prior subsection defines a function to be a determinant if it satisfies four conditions and shows that there is at most one $N by N$ determinant function for each $n$. What is left is to show that for each $n$ such a function exists.  But, we easily compute determinants: we use Gauss's Method, keeping track of the sign changes from row swaps, and end by multiplying down the diagonal. How could they not exist?  The difficulty is to show that the computation gives a well-defined- that is, unique- result.  Consider these two Gauss's Method reductions of the same matrix, the first without any row swap $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 2 0 -2 ]) $ and the second with one. $ ([ 1 2 3 4 ]) for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ ([ 3 4 1 2 ]) for step $-(1/3)ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 3 4 0 2/3 ]) $ Both yield the determinant $-2$ since in the second one we note that the row swap changes the sign of the result we get by multiplying down the diagonal.  The fact that we are able to proceed in two ways opens the possibility that the two give different answers.              That is, the way that we have given to compute determinant values does not plainly eliminate the possibility that there might be, say, two reductions of some $N by N$~matrix that lead to different determinant values. In that case we would not have a function, since the definition of a function is that for each input there must be exactly associated one output. The rest of this section shows that the definition~def:Det never leads to a conflict.               To do this we will define an alternative way to find the value of a determinant. (This alternative is less useful in practice because it is slow. But it is very useful for theory.) The key idea is that condition~(3) of def:Det shows that the determinant function is not linear.  For example With condition~(3) scalars come out of each row separately, $ ([ 4 2 -2 6 ]) =2·([ 2 1 -2 6 ]) =4·([ 2 1 -1 3 ]) $ not from the entire matrix at once. So, where $ A=([ 2 1 -1 3 ]) $ then $ det(2A) ≠ 2·det(A) $ (instead, $ det(2A) = 4·det(A) $).   Since scalars come out a row at a time we might guess that determinants are linear a row at a time.    Let $ V $ be a vector space. A map $ f: V^n → ℝ $ is multilinear if   $ f(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(v)+vec(w), ...,vec(ρ)_n) =f(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(v),...,vec(ρ)_n) +f(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(w),...,vec(ρ)_n) $  $ f(vec(ρ)_1,...,kvec(v),...,vec(ρ)_n) =k· f(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(v),...,vec(ρ)_n) $  for $ vec(v), vec(w) in V $ and $ k in ℝ $.      Determinants are multilinear.      Property~(2) here is just def:Det's condition~(3) so we need only verify property~(1).          There are two cases. If the set of other rows $ {vec{{ρ}_1,...,vec{{ρ}_{{i-1},vec{{ρ}_{{i+1}, ...,vec(ρ)_n} $ is linearly dependent then all three matrices are singular and so all three determinants are zero and the equality is trivial.    Therefore assume that the set of other rows is linearly independent. We can make a basis by adding one more vector $sequence{vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(ρ)_{i-1},vec(β), vec(ρ)_{i+1},...,vec(ρ)_n}$. Express $vec(v)$ and $vec(w)$ with respect to this basis $ vec(v) =v_1vec(ρ)_1+...+v_{i-1}vec(ρ)_{i-1}+v_ivec(β) +v_{i+1}vec(ρ)_{i+1}+...+v_nvec(ρ)_n vec(w) = w_1vec(ρ)_1+...+w_{i-1}vec(ρ)_{i-1}+w_ivec(β) +w_{i+1}vec(ρ)_{i+1}+...+w_nvec(ρ)_n $ and add. $ vec(v)+vec(w) = (v_1+w_1)vec(ρ)_1+...+(v_i+w_i)vec(β) +...+(v_n+w_n)vec(ρ)_n $ Consider the left side of (1) and expand $vec(v)+vec(w)$.  $ det(vec(ρ)_1,...,(v_1+w_1)vec(ρ)_1+...+(v_i+w_i)vec(β) +...+(v_n+w_n)vec(ρ)_n,...,vec(ρ)_n)  $     By the definition of determinant's condition~(1), the value of ($*$)  is unchanged by the operation of adding $-(v_1+w_1)vec(ρ)_1$ to the $i$-th row $vec(v)+vec(w)$. The $i$-th row becomes this. $ vec(v)+vec(w)-(v_1+w_1)vec(ρ)_1 = (v_2+w_2)vec(ρ)_2+·s+(v_i+w_i)vec(β) +...+(v_n+w_n)vec(ρ)_n $   Next add $-(v_2+w_2)vec(ρ)_2$, etc., to eliminate all of the terms from the other rows. Apply condition~(3) from the definition of determinant. $ det(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(v)+vec(w),...,vec(ρ)_n) $ =det(vec(ρ)_1,...,(v_i+w_i)·vec(β),...,vec(ρ)_n) =(v_i+w_i)·det(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(β),...,vec(ρ)_n) =v_i· det(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(β),...,vec(ρ)_n) +w_i· det(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(β),...,vec(ρ)_n) $ $ Now this is a sum of two determinants. To finish, bring $v_i$ and $w_i$ back inside in front of the $vec(β)$'s and use row combinations again, this time to reconstruct the expressions of $vec(v)$ and $vec(w)$ in terms of the basis. That is, start with the operations of adding $v_1vec(ρ)_1$ to $v_ivec(β)$ and $w_1vec(ρ)_1$ to $w_ivec(ρ)_1$, etc., to get the expansions of $vec(v)$ and $vec(w)$.    Multilinearity allows us to expand a determinant into a sum of determinants, each of which involves a simple matrix.  For example Use property~(1) of multilinearity to break up the first row $ ([ 2 1 4 3 ]) = ([ 2 0 4 3 ]) + ([ 0 1 4 3 ]) $ and then use (1) again to break each along the second row. $ =([ 2 0 4 0 ]) + ([ 2 0 0 3 ]) + ([ 0 1 4 0 ]) + ([ 0 1 0 3 ]) $ The result is four determinants. In each row of each of the four there is a single entry from the original matrix.   For example In the same way, a $ N by N $ determinant separates into a sum of many simpler determinants. Splitting along the first row produces three determinants (we have highlighted the zero in the $1,3$ position to set it off visually from the zeroes that appear as part of the splitting). $ ([ 2 1 -1 4 3 0 2 1 5 ]) = ([ 2 0 0 4 3 0 2 1 5 ]) + ([ 0 1 0 4 3 0 2 1 5 ]) + ([ 0 0 -1 4 3 0 2 1 5 ]) $ In turn, each of the above splits in three along the second row. Then each of the nine splits in three along the third row. The result is twenty seven determinants, such that each row contains a single entry from the starting matrix. $ = ([ 2 0 0 4 0 0 2 0 0 ]) + ([ 2 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 ]) + ([ 2 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 ]) + ([ 2 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 ]) +...+ ([ 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 5 ]) $   So multilinearity will expand an $ N by N $ determinant into a sum of $ n^n $-many determinants, where each row of each determinant contains a single entry from the starting matrix.  In this expansion, although there are lots of terms, most of them have a determinant of zero.  For example In each of these examples from the prior expansion, two of the entries from the original matrix are in the same column. $ ([ 2 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 ])  ([ 0 0 -1 0 3 0 0 0 5 ]) \ ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 ]) $ For instance, in the first matrix the $2$ and the $4$ both come from the first column of the original matrix. In the second matrix the $-1$ and~$5$ both come from the third column. And in the third matrix the $0$ and~$5$ both come from the third column. Any such matrix is singular because one row is a multiple of the other. Thus any such determinant is zero, by .  With that observation the above expansion of the $ N by N $ determinant into the sum of the twenty seven determinants simplifies to the sum of these six where the entries from the original matrix come one per row, and also one per column. $ ([ 2 1 -1 4 3 0 2 1 5 ]) =([ 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 5 ]) + ([ 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ]) +([ 0 1 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 ]) + ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 ]) +([ 0 0 -1 4 0 0 0 1 0 ]) + ([ 0 0 -1 0 3 0 2 0 0 ]) $ In that expansion we can bring out the scalars. $ =(2)(3)(5)([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) +(2)(0)(1)([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ]) +(1)(4)(5)([ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) +(1)(0)(2)([ 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ]) +(-1)(4)(1)([ 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) +(-1)(3)(2)([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]) $ To finish, evaluate those six determinants by row-swapping them to the identity matrix, keeping track of the sign changes. $ =30· (+1)+0· (-1) +20· (-1)+0· (+1) -4· (+1)-6· (-1)=12 $   That example captures this subsection's new calculation scheme. Multilinearity expands a determinant into many separate determinants, each with one entry from the original matrix per row. Most of these have one row that is a multiple of another so we omit them. We are left with the determinants that have one entry per row and column from the original matrix. Factoring out the scalars further reduces the determinants that we must compute to the one-entry-per-row-and-column matrices where all entries are $1$'s.   Recall Definition~Three.IV., that a permutation matrix  is square, with entries $0$'s except for a single $1$ in each row and column. We now introduce a notation for permutation matrices.     An $ n $-permutation is a function on the first~$n$ positive integers $map(φ){{1,...,n}}{{1,...,n}}$ that is one-to-one and onto.    In a permutation each number $1$, ..., $n$ appears as output for one and only one input. We can denote a permutation as a sequence $φ=φ(1),φ(2),...,φ(n)$.  For example  The $2$-permutations are the functions $map(φ_1){{1,2}}{{1,2}}$ given by $φ_1(1)=1$, $φ_1(2)=2$, and $map(φ_2){{1,2}}{{1,2}}$ given by $φ_2(1)=2$, $φ_2(2)=1$. The sequence notation is shorter: $ φ_1=1,2 $ and $ φ_2=2,1 $.    For example  In the sequence notation the $3$-permutations are $ φ_1=1,2,3 $, $ φ_2=1,3,2 $, $ φ_3=2,1,3 $, $ φ_4=2,3,1 $, $ φ_5=3,1,2 $, and $ φ_6=3,2,1 $.     We denote the row vector that is all $0$'s except for a $1$ in entry $j$ with $ι_j$ so that the four-wide $ι_2$ is~$[0 1 0 0]$. Now our notation for permutation matrices is: with any $φ=φ(1),...,φ(n)$ associate the matrix whose rows are $ι_{φ(1)}$, ..., $ι_{φ(n)}$.  For instance, associated with the $4$-permutation $ φ=3,2,1,4 $ is the matrix whose rows are the corresponding $ι$'s. $ P_{φ}= ([ ι_{3} ι_{2} ι_{1} ι_{4} ])= ([ 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]) $  For example These are the permutation matrices for the $2$-permutations listed in . $ P_{φ_1} =([ ι_1 ι_2 ]) =([ 1 0 0 1 ])  P_{φ_2} =([ ι_2 ι_1 ]) =([ 0 1 1 0 ]) $ For instance, $P_{φ_2}$'s first row is $ι_{φ_2(1)}=ι_2$ and its second is $ι_{φ_2(2)}=ι_1$.   For example Consider the $3$-permutation $ φ_5=3,1,2 $. The permutation matrix $P_{φ_5}$ has rows $ι_{φ_5(1)}=ι_3$, $ι_{φ_5(2)}=ι_1$, and $ι_{φ_5(3)}=ι_2$.$             P_{φ_5}      =([ 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $     The permutation expansion  for determinants is $ ([ t_{1,1} t_{1,2} ... t_{1,n} t_{2,1} t_{2,2} ... t_{2,n} ... t_{n,1} t_{n,2} ... t_{n,n} ]) = $[t] t_{1,φ_1(1)}t_{2,φ_1(2)}·s t_{n,φ_1(n)}deter{P_{φ_1}} [.5ex] +t_{1,φ_2(1)}t_{2,φ_2(2)}·s t_{n,φ_2(n)}deter{P_{φ_2}} ... +t_{1,φ_k(1)}t_{2,φ_k(2)}·s t_{n,φ_k(n)}deter{P_{φ_k}} $ $ where $ φ_1,...,φ_k $ are all of the $ n $-permutations.    We can restate the formula in definend{summation notation} $ determinant(T)= ∑_{permutations φ} t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} deter{P_{φ}} $ read aloud as, ``the sum, over all permutations $ φ $, of terms having the form $ t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} deter{P_{φ}} $.''    For example The familiar $N by N$ determinant formula follows from the above $ ([ t_{1,1} t_{1,2} t_{2,1} t_{2,2} ]) = t_{1,1}t_{2,2}·deter{P_{φ_1}} + t_{1,2}t_{2,1}·deter{P_{φ_2}} [-1.5ex] = t_{1,1}t_{2,2}·([ 1 0 0 1 ]) + t_{1,2}t_{2,1}·([ 0 1 1 0 ]) =t_{1,1}t_{2,2}-t_{1,2}t_{2,1} $ as does the $N by N$ formula. $ ([ t_{1,1} t_{1,2} t_{1,3} t_{2,1} t_{2,2} t_{2,3} t_{3,1} t_{3,2} t_{3,3} ]) = $[t] t_{1,1}t_{2,2}t_{3,3}deter{P_{φ_1}} +t_{1,1}t_{2,3}t_{3,2}deter{P_{φ_2}} +t_{1,2}t_{2,1}t_{3,3}deter{P_{φ_3}}  +t_{1,2}t_{2,3}t_{3,1}deter{P_{φ_4}} +t_{1,3}t_{2,1}t_{3,2}deter{P_{φ_5}} +t_{1,3}t_{2,2}t_{3,1}deter{P_{φ_6}} $ = $[t] t_{1,1}t_{2,2}t_{3,3} -t_{1,1}t_{2,3}t_{3,2} -t_{1,2}t_{2,1}t_{3,3}  +t_{1,2}t_{2,3}t_{3,1} +t_{1,3}t_{2,1}t_{3,2} -t_{1,3}t_{2,2}t_{3,1} $ $   Computing a determinant with the permutation expansion typically takes longer than with Gauss's Method. However, we will use it to prove that the determinant function is well-defined. We will just state the result here and defer its proof to the following subsection.      For each $n$ there is an $N by N$ determinant function.    Also in the next subsection is the proof of the result below (they are together because the two proofs overlap).     The determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its transpose.    Because of this theorem, while we have so far stated determinant results in terms of rows, all of the results also hold in terms of columns.    A matrix with two equal columns is singular. Column swaps change the sign of a determinant. Determinants are multilinear in their columns.      For the first statement, transposing the matrix results in a matrix with the same determinant, and with two equal rows, and hence a determinant of zero. Prove the other two in the same way.    We finish this subsection with a summary: determinant functions exist, are unique, and we know how to compute them. As for what determinants are about, perhaps these lines help make it memorable. begin(verse) Determinant none, * Solution: lots or none. * Determinant some, * Solution: just one. end(verse)      []textit{This summarizes our notation for the $2$- and $3$- permutations.

Therefore, each permutation has an inverse.  Find the inverse of each $2$-permutation. Find the inverse of each $3$-permutation.   Each of these is easy to check.   [t] permutation $φ_1$φ_2$  inverse $φ_1$φ_2$   [t] permutation $φ_1$φ_2$φ_3$φ_4$φ_5$φ_6$  inverse $φ_1$φ_2$φ_3$φ_5$φ_4$φ_6$     Prove that $ f $ is multilinear if and only if for all $ vec(v),vec(w) in V $ and $ k_1,k_2 in ℝ $, this holds. $ f(vec(ρ)_1,...,k_1vec(v)_1+k_2vec(v)_2, ...,vec(ρ)_n) = k_1f(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(v)_1,...,vec(ρ)_n)+ k_2f(vec(ρ)_1,...,vec(v)_2,...,vec(ρ)_n) $  For the `if' half, the first condition of def:multilinear follows from taking $k_1=k_2=1$ and the second condition follows from taking $k_2=0$.  The `only if' half also routine. From $ f(vec(ρ)_1,...,k_1vec(v)_1+k_2vec(v)_2, ...,vec(ρ)_n) $ the first condition of def:multilinear gives $ = f(vec(ρ)_1,...,k_1vec(v)_1,...,vec(ρ)_n)+ f(vec(ρ)_1,...,k_2vec(v)_2,...,vec(ρ)_n) $ and the second condition, applied twice, gives the result.   How would determinants change if we changed property~(4) of the definition to read that $ determinant(I)=2 $?  They would all double.   Verify the second and third statements in .  For the second statement, given a matrix, transpose it, swap rows, and transpose back. The result is swapped columns, and the determinant changes by a factor of $ -1 $. The third statement is similar:~given a matrix, transpose it, apply multilinearity to what are now rows, and then transpose back the resulting matrices.   Show that if an $ N by N $ matrix has a nonzero determinant then we can express any column vector $ vec(v) in ℝ^n $ as a linear combination of the columns of the matrix.  An $ N by N $ matrix with a nonzero determinant has rank $ n $ so its columns form a basis for $ ℝ^n $.    True or false: a matrix whose entries are only zeros or ones has a determinant equal to zero, one, or negative one.  False. $ ([ 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 ]) =2 $    Show that there are $120$ terms in the permutation expansion formula of a $ N by N $ matrix.  How many are sure to be zero if the $ 1,2 $ entry is zero?    For the column index of the entry in the first row there are five choices. Then, for the column index of the entry in the second row there are four choices. Continuing, we get $5· 4· 3· 2· 1=120$. (See also the next question.) Once we choose the second column in the first row, we can choose the other entries in $ 4· 3· 2· 1=24 $ ways.    How many $ n $-permutations are there?  $ n·(n-1)·s 2· 1=n! $  Show that the inverse of a permutation matrix is its transpose.   We will show that $PPᵀ=I$; the $PᵀP=I$ argument is similar. The $i,j$ entry of $PPᵀ$ is the sum of terms of the form $p_{i,k}q_{k,j}$ where the entries of $Pᵀ$ are denoted with $q$'s, that is, $q_{k,j}=p_{j,k}$. Thus the $i,j$ entry of $PPᵀ$ is the sum $ ∑_{k=1}^n p_{i,k}p_{j,k} $. But $p_{i,k}$ is usually $0$, and so $P_{i,k}P_{j,k}$ is usually $0$. The only time $P_{i,k}$ is nonzero is when it is $1$, but then there are no other $i^prime≠ i$ such that $P_{i^prime,k}$ is nonzero ($i$ is the only row with a $1$ in column~$k$). In other words, $ ∑_{k=1}^n p_{i,k}p_{j,k}= begin(cases) 1 i=j 0 otherwise end(cases) $ and this is exactly the formula for the entries of the identity matrix.   A matrix $ A $ is skew-symmetric if $ Aᵀ=-A $, as in this matrix. $ A=([ 0 3 -3 0 ]) $ Show that $ N by N $ skew-symmetric matrices with nonzero determinants exist only for even $ n $.  In $ determinant(A)=determinant(Aᵀ)=determinant(-A)=(-1)^ndeterminant(A) $ the exponent $n$ must be even.   What is the smallest number of zeros, and the placement of those zeros, needed to ensure that a $ N by N $ matrix has a determinant of zero?  Showing that no placement of three zeros suffices is routine. Four zeroes does suffice; put them all in the same row or column.   If we have $ n $ data points $ (x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),...,(x_n,y_n) $ and want to find a polynomial $ p(x)=a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_{n-2}x^{n-2}+...+a_1x+a_0 $ passing through those points then we can plug in the points to get an $ n $~equation/$ n $~unknown linear system. The matrix of coefficients for that system is the Vandermonde matrix.  Prove that the determinant of the transpose of that matrix of coefficients $ ([ 1 1 ... 1 x_1 x_2 ... x_n {x_1}^2 {x_2}^2 ... {x_n}^2 ... {x_1}^{n-1} {x_2}^{n-1} ... {x_n}^{n-1} ]) $ equals the product, over all indices $ i,j in{1,...,n} $ with $ i<j $, of terms of the form $ x_j-x_i $. (This shows that the determinant is zero, and the linear system has no solution, if and only if the $ x_i $'s in the data are not distinct.)  The $n=3$ case shows what to do. The row combination operations of $-x_1ρ_2+ρ_3$ and $-x_1ρ_1+ρ_2$ give this. $ ([ 1 1 1 x_1 x_2 x_3 x_1^2 x_2^2 x_3^2 ]) = ([ 1 1 1 x_1 x_2 x_3 0 (-x_1+x_2)x_2 (-x_1+x_3)x_3 ]) = ([ 1 1 1 0 -x_1+x_2 -x_1+x_3 0 (-x_1+x_2)x_2 (-x_1+x_3)x_3 ]) $ Then the row combination operation of $x_2ρ_2+ρ_3$ gives the desired result. $ = ([ 1 1 1 0 -x_1+x_2 -x_1+x_3 0 0 (-x_1+x_3)(-x_2+x_3) ]) =(x_2-x_1)(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2) $   We can divide a matrix into blocks, as here, $ ([ 1 2 0 3 4 0 0 0 -2 ]) $ which shows four blocks, the square $N by N$ and $N by N$ ones in the upper left and lower right, and the zero blocks in the upper right and lower left. Show that if a matrix is such that we can partition it as $ T= ([ J Z_2 Z_1 K ]) $ where $J$ and $K$ are square, and $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are all zeroes, then $ determinant(T)=determinant(J)·determinant(K) $.  Let $ T $ be $ N by N $, let $ J $ be $ N by p $, and let $ K $ be $ N by q $. Apply the permutation expansion formula $ determinant(T)= ∑_{permutations φ} t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}... t_{n,φ(n)} deter{P_{φ}} $ Because the upper right of $ T $ is all zeroes, if a $ φ $ has at least one of $ p+1,...,n $ among its first $ p $ column numbers $ φ(1),...,φ(p) $ then the term arising from $ φ $ is $ 0 $ (e.g., if $ φ(1)=n $ then $ t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}... t_{n,φ(n)} $ is $ 0 $). So the above formula reduces to a sum over all permutations with two halves: first rearrange $ 1,...,p $ and after that comes a permutation of $ p+1,...,p+q $. To see this gives $ determinant(J)·determinant(K) $, distribute. $ g[∑_{substack{perms φ_1 of 1,...,p}} t_{1,φ_1(1)}·s t_{p,φ_1(p)} deter{P_{φ_1}} g] · g[∑_{substack{perms φ_2 of p+1,...,p+q}} t_{p+1,φ_2(p+1)}·s t_{p+q,φ_2(p+q)} deter{P_{φ_2}} g] $   Prove that for any $ N by N $ matrix $ T $ there are at most $ n $ distinct reals $ r $ such that the matrix $ T-rI $ has determinant zero (we shall use this result in Chapter Five).  The $n=3$ case shows what happens. $ determinant(T-rI) = ([ t_{1,1}-x t_{1,2} t_{1,3} t_{2,1} t_{2,2}-x t_{2,3} t_{3,1} t_{3,2} t_{3,3}-x ]) $ Each term in the permutation expansion has three factors drawn from entries in the matrix (e.g., $(t_{1,1}-x)(t_{2,2}-x)(t_{3,3}-x)$ and $(t_{1,1}-x)(t_{2,3})(t_{3,2})$), and so the determinant is expressible as a polynomial in $x$ of degree $3$. Such a polynomial has at most $3$ roots.  In general, the permutation expansion shows that the determinant is a sum of terms, each with $ n $ factors, giving a polynomial of degree $n$. A polynomial of degree $ n $ has at most $ n $ roots.    The nine positive digits can be arranged into $ N by N $ arrays in $ 9! $ ways. Find the sum of the determinants of these arrays.   When two rows of a determinant are interchanged, the sign of the determinant is changed. When the rows of a three-by-three determinant are permuted, $ 3 $ positive and $ 3 $ negative determinants equal in absolute value are obtained. Hence the $ 9! $ determinants fall into $ 9!/6 $ groups, each of which sums to zero.    Show that $ ([ x-2 x-3 x-4 x+1 x-1 x-3 x-4 x-7 x-10 ])=0. $   When the elements of any column are subtracted from the elements of each of the other two, the elements in two of the columns of the derived determinant are proportional, so the determinant vanishes. That is, $ ([ 2 1 x-4 4 2 x-3 6 3 x-10 ])= ([ 1 x-3 -1 2 x-1 -2 3 x-7 -3 ])= ([ x-2 -1 -2 x+1 -2 -4 x-4 -3 -6 ])=0. $    Let $ S $ be the sum of the integer elements of a magic square of order three and let $ D $ be the value of the square considered as a determinant. Show that $ D/S $ is an integer.   Let $ $ a b c d e f g h i $ $ have magic sum $ N=S/3 $. Then $ N =(a+e+i)+(d+e+f)+(g+e+c) -(a+d+g)-(c+f+i)=3e $ and $ S=9e $. Hence, adding rows and columns, $ D= ([ a b c d e f g h i ]) =([ a b c d e f 3e 3e 3e ]) =([ a b 3e d e 3e 3e 3e 9e ]) =([ a b e d e e 1 1 1 ])S. $    Show that the determinant of the $ n^2 $ elements in the upper left corner of the Pascal triangle $ $ 1 1 1 1 . . 1 2 3 . . 1 3 . . 1 . . . . $ $ has the value unity.   Denote by $ D_n $ the determinant in question and by $ a_{i,j} $ the element in the $ i $-th row and $ j $-th column. Then from the law of formation of the elements we have $ a_{i,j}=a_{i,j-1}+a_{i-1,j}, a_{1,j}=a_{i,1}=1. $ Subtract each row of $ D_n $ from the row following it, beginning the process with the last pair of rows. After the $ n-1 $ subtractions the above equality shows that the element $ a_{i,j} $ is replaced by the element $ a_{i,j-1} $, and all the elements in the first column, except $ a_{1,1}=1 $, become zeroes. Now subtract each column from the one following it, beginning with the last pair. After this process the element $ a_{i,j-1} $ is replaced by $ a_{i-1,j-1} $, as shown in the above relation. The result of the two operations is to replace $ a_{i,j} $ by $ a_{i-1,j-1} $, and to reduce each element in the first row and in the first column to zero. Hence $ D_n=D_{n+i} $ and consequently $ D_n=D_{n-1}=D_{n-2}=...=D_2=1. $                  textit{This subsection contains proofs of two results from the prior subsection. It is optional. We will use the material developed here only in the Jordan Canonical Form subsection, which is also optional.}  We wish to show that for any size~$n$, the determinant function on $N by N$ matrices is well-defined. The prior subsection develops the permutation expansion formula.  $   ([ t_{1,1} t_{1,2} ... t_{1,n} t_{2,1} t_{2,2} ... t_{2,n} ... t_{n,1} t_{n,2} ... t_{n,n} ]) = $[t] t_{1,φ_1(1)}t_{2,φ_1(2)}·s t_{n,φ_1(n)}deter{P_{φ_1}} [.75ex] +t_{1,φ_2(1)}t_{2,φ_2(2)}·s t_{n,φ_2(n)}deter{P_{φ_2}} [.75ex] ... +t_{1,φ_k(1)}t_{2,φ_k(2)}·s t_{n,φ_k(n)}deter{P_{φ_k}} $ [1ex] =∑_{permutations φ} t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} deter{P_{φ}} $ This reduces the problem of showing that the determinant is well-defined to only showing that the determinant is well-defined on the set of permutation matrices.  A permutation matrix can be row-swapped to the identity matrix. So one way that we can calculate its determinant is by keeping track of the number of swaps. However, we still must show that the result is well-defined. Recall what the difficulty is:~the determinant of $ P_{φ}= ([ 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) $ could be computed with one swap $ P_{φ} for step $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) $ or with three. $ P_{φ} for step $ρ_3↔ρ_1$       repeat step $ρ_2↔ρ_3$       repeat step $ρ_1↔ρ_3$ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) $ Both reductions have an odd number of swaps so in this case we figure that $ deter{P_{φ}}=-1 $ but if there were some way to do it with an even number of swaps then we would have the determinant giving two different outputs from a single input. Below, proves that this cannot happen- there is no permutation matrix that can be row-swapped to an identity matrix in two ways, one with an even number of swaps and the other with an odd number of swaps.       In a permutation $φ=...,k,...,j,...$, elements such that $k>j$ are in an inversion of their natural order. Similarly, in a permutation matrix two rows $ P_{φ}= ([ ... ι_{k} ... ι_{j} ... ]) $ such that $ k>j $ are in an inversion.     For example This permutation matrix $ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]) = ([ ι_1 ι_3 ι_2 ι_4 ]) $ has a single inversion, that $ ι_3 $ precedes $ ι_2 $.   For example There are three inversions here: $ ([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]) = ([ ι_3 ι_2 ι_1 ]) $ $ ι_3 $ precedes $ ι_1 $, $ ι_3 $ precedes $ ι_2 $, and $ ι_2 $ precedes $ ι_1 $.     A row-swap in a permutation matrix changes the number of inversions from even to odd, or from odd to even.      Consider a swap of rows $j$ and $k$, where $k>j$.  If the two rows are adjacent $ P_{φ}= ([ ... ι_{φ(j)} ι_{φ(k)} ... ]) for step $ρ_k↔ρ_j$ ([ ... ι_{φ(k)} ι_{φ(j)} ... ]) $ then since inversions involving rows not in this pair are not affected, the swap changes the total number of inversions by one, either removing or producing one inversion depending on whether $ φ(j)>φ(k) $ or not. Consequently, the total number of inversions changes from odd to even or from even to odd.    If the rows are not adjacent then we can swap them via a sequence of adjacent swaps, first bringing row~$k$ up $ ([ ... ι_{φ(j)} ι_{φ(j+1)} ι_{φ(j+2)} ... ι_{φ(k)} ... ]) grstep{ρ_k ↔ ρ_{k-1}} repeatedgrstep{ρ_{k-1} ↔ ρ_{k-2}} ·s grstep{ρ_{j+1} ↔ ρ_j} ([ ... ι_{φ(k)} ι_{φ(j)} ι_{φ(j+1)} ... ι_{φ(k-1)} ... ]) $   and then bringing row~$j$ down. $ grstep{ρ_{j+1} ↔ ρ_{j+2}} repeatedgrstep{ρ_{j+2} ↔ ρ_{j+3}} ·s grstep{ρ_{k-1} ↔ ρ_k} ([ ... ι_{φ(k)} ι_{φ(j+1)} ι_{φ(j+2)} ... ι_{φ(j)} ... ]) $ Each of these adjacent swaps changes the number of inversions from odd to even or from even to odd. The total number of swaps $ (k-j)+(k-j-1) $ is odd. Thus, in aggregate, the number of inversions changes from even to odd, or from odd to even.      If a permutation matrix has an odd number of inversions then swapping it to the identity takes an odd number of swaps. If it has an even number of inversions then swapping to the identity takes an even number.      The identity matrix has zero inversions. To change an odd number to zero requires an odd number of swaps, and to change an even number to zero requires an even number of swaps.    For example The matrix in can be brought to the identity with one swap $ρ_1↔ρ_3$. (So the number of swaps needn't be the same as the number of inversions, but the oddness or evenness of the two numbers is the same.)     The signum } of a permutation $ sgn((φ) $) is $ -1 $ if the number of inversions in $ φ $ is odd and is $ +1 $ if the number of inversions is even.    For example Using the notation for the $3$-permutations from we have $ P_{φ_1}= ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ])  P_{φ_2}= ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ]) $ so $ sgn((φ_1)=1 $ because there are no inversions,) while $ sgn((φ_2)=-1 $ because there is one.)   We still have not shown that the determinant function is well-defined because we have not considered row operations on permutation matrices other than row swaps. We will finesse this issue.  Define a function $ map(d){matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ} $ by altering the permutation expansion formula, replacing $determinant(P_φ)$ with $sgn((φ)$.) $ d(T)= ∑_{permutations φ}t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} ·sgn((φ)) $   The advantage of this formula is that the number of inversions is clearly well-defined- just count them. Therefore, we will be finished showing that an~$N by N$ determinant function exists when we show that this $d$ satisfies the conditions required of a determinant.      The function $ d $ above is a determinant. Hence determinants exist for every $n$.      We must check that it has the four conditions from the definition of determinant, def:Det.    Condition~(4) is easy: where $I$ is the $N by N$ identity, in $ d(I)= ∑_{perm φ} ι_{1,φ(1)}ι_{2,φ(2)}·s ι_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ)) $ all of the terms in the summation are zero except for the one where the permutation~$φ$ is the identity, which gives the product down the diagonal, which is one.    For condition~(3) suppose that $ Tsmash[b]{for step $kρ_i$}T̂ $ and consider $d(T̂)$. $ ∑_{perm φ} t̂_{1,φ(1)} ·st̂_{i,φ(i)}·st̂_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ)) =∑_{φ} t_{1,φ(1)}·s kt_{i,φ(i)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ)) $ Factor out~$ k $ to get the desired equality. $ =k·∑_{φ} t_{1,φ(1)}·s t_{i,φ(i)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ)) =k· d(T) $    For~(2) suppose that $ Tsmash[b]{for step $ρ_i ↔ ρ_j$}T̂ $. We must show that $d(T̂)$ is the negative of $d(T)$. $ d(T̂)= ∑_{perm φ} t̂_{1,φ(1)} ·st̂_{i,φ(i)} ·st̂_{j,φ(j)} ·s t̂_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ))  $ We will show that each term in ($*$) is associated with a term in $d(T)$, and that the two terms are negatives of each other. Consider the matrix from the multilinear expansion of $d(T̂)$ giving the term $t̂_{1,φ(1)} ·st̂_{i,φ(i)} ·st̂_{j,φ(j)} ·s t̂_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ)$.) $ ([ ... t̂_{i,φ(i)} ... t̂_{j,φ(j)} ... ]) $   It is the result of the $ρ_i ↔ ρ_j$ operation performed on this matrix. $ ([ ... t_{i,φ(j)} ... t_{j,φ(i)} ... ]) $ That is, the term with hatted $t$'s is associated with this term from the $d(T)$ expansion: $ t_{1,σ(1)} ·s t_{j,σ(j)} ·s t_{i,σ(i)} ·s t_{n,σ(n)} sgn((σ)) $, where the permutation $ σ $ equals $ φ $ but with the $ i $-th and $ j $-th numbers interchanged, $ σ(i)=φ(j) $ and $ σ(j)=φ(i) $. The two terms have the same multiplicands $t̂_{1,φ(1)}=t_{1,σ(1)}$, ..., including the entries from the swapped rows $t̂_{i,φ(i)}=t_{j,φ(i)}=t_{j,σ(j)}$ and $t̂_{j,φ(j)}=t_{i,φ(j)}=t_{i,σ(i)}$. But the two terms are negatives of each other since $ sgn((φ)=-sgn(σ) $ by .)    Now, any permutation $φ$ can be derived from some other permutation $σ$ by such a swap, in one and only one way. Therefore the summation in ($*$) is in fact a sum over all permutations, taken once and only once. $ d(T̂) = ∑_{perm φ} t̂_{1,φ(1)} ·st̂_{i,φ(i)} ·st̂_{j,φ(j)} ·s t̂_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ)) =∑_{perm σ} t_{1,σ(1)} ·s t_{j,σ(j)} ·s t_{i,σ(i)} ·s t_{n,σ(n)} ·[(-sgn((σ)])) $ Thus $ d(T̂)=-d(T) $.    Finally, for condition~(1) suppose that $ Tsmash[b]{for step $kρ_i+ρ_j$}T̂ $. $ d(T̂) =∑_{perm φ} t̂_{1,φ(1)}·st̂_{i,φ(i)} ·st̂_{j,φ(j)}·st̂_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ)) =∑_{φ} t_{1,φ(1)}·s t_{i,φ(i)} ·s (kt_{i,φ(j)}+t_{j,φ(j)})·s t_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ)) $   Distribute over the addition in $kt_{i,φ(j)}+t_{j,φ(j)}$. $ = $[t] smash[b]{∑_{φ}}[t_{1,φ(1)}·s t_{i,φ(i)} ·s kt_{i,φ(j)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ))  +t_{1,φ(1)}·s t_{i,φ(i)} ·s t_{j,φ(j)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ)]) $ $ Break it into two summations. $ =$[t] smash[b]{∑_{φ}} \:t_{1,φ(1)}·s t_{i,φ(i)} ·s kt_{i,φ(j)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ))  +smash[b]{∑_{φ}}\: t_{1,φ(1)}·s t_{i,φ(i)} ·s t_{j,φ(j)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ)) $ $ Recognize the second one. $ =$[t] k· smash[b]{∑_{φ}}\: t_{1,φ(1)}·s t_{i,φ(i)} ·s t_{i,φ(j)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ))  +d(T) $ $   Consider the terms $ t_{1,φ(1)}·s t_{i,φ(i)} ·s t_{i,φ(j)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} sgn((φ) $.) Notice the subscripts; the entry is $ t_{i,φ(j)} $, not $ t_{j,φ(j)} $. The sum of these terms is the determinant of a matrix~$ S $ that is equal to $ T $ except that row~$j$ of $S$ is a copy of row~$i$ of $T$, that is, $S$ has two equal rows. In the same way that we proved we can see that $d(S)=0$: a swap of $S$'s equal rows will change the sign of $d(S)$ but since the matrix is unchanged by that swap the value of $d(S)$ must also be unchanged, and so that value must be zero.    We have now proved that determinant functions exist for each size~$N by N$. We already know that for each size there is at most one determinant. Therefore, for each size there is one and only one determinant function.  We end this subsection by proving the other result remaining from the prior subsection.     The determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its transpose.      The proof is best understood by doing the general $N by N$ case. That the argument applies to the $N by N$ case will be clear.  Compare the permutation expansion of the matrix~$T$ $ ([ t_{1,1} t_{1,2} t_{1,3} t_{2,1} t_{2,2} t_{2,3} t_{3,1} t_{3,2} t_{3,3} ]) = t_{1,1}t_{2,2}t_{3,3} ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{1,1}t_{2,3}t_{3,2} ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ]) + t_{1,2}t_{2,1}t_{3,3} ([ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{1,2}t_{2,3}t_{3,1} ([ 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ]) + t_{1,3}t_{2,1}t_{3,2} ([ 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) +t_{1,3}t_{2,2}t_{3,1} ([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]) $ with the permutation expansion of its transpose.   $ ([ t_{1,1} t_{2,1} t_{3,1} t_{1,2} t_{2,2} t_{3,2} t_{1,3} t_{2,3} t_{3,3} ]) = t_{1,1}t_{2,2}t_{3,3} ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{1,1}t_{3,2}t_{2,3} ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ]) + t_{2,1}t_{1,2}t_{3,3} ([ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{2,1}t_{3,2}t_{1,3} ([ 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ]) + t_{3,1}t_{1,2}t_{2,3} ([ 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) +t_{3,1}t_{2,2}t_{1,3} ([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]) $ Compare first the six products of $t$'s. The ones in the expansion of~$T$ are the same as the ones in the expansion of the transpose; for instance, $t_{1,2}t_{2,3}t_{3,1}$ is in the top and $t_{3,1}t_{1,2}t_{2,3}$ is in the bottom. That's perfectly sensible- the six in the top arise from all of the ways of picking one entry of~$T$ from each row and column while the six in the bottom are all of the ways of picking one entry of~$T$ from each column and row, so of course they are the same set.    Next observe that in the two expansions, each $t$-product expression is not necessarily associated with the same permutation matrix. For instance, on the top $t_{1,2}t_{2,3}t_{3,1}$ is associated with the matrix for the map $1↦ 2$, $2↦ 3$, $3↦ 1$. On the bottom $t_{3,1}t_{1,2}t_{2,3}$ is associated with the matrix for the map $1↦ 3$, $2↦ 1$, $3↦ 2$. The second map is inverse to the first. This is also perfectly sensible- both the matrix transpose and the map inverse flip the $1,2$ to $2,1$, flip the $2,3$ to $3,2$, and flip $3,1$ to $1,3$.  We finish by noting that the determinant of $P_{φ}$ equals the determinant of $P_{φ^{-1}}$, as  shows.      []textit{These summarize the notation used in this book for the $2$- and $3$- permutations.

This is the permutation expansion of the determinant of a $N by N$ matrix $ ([ a b c d ]) =ad· ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) +bc· ([ 0 1 1 0 ]) $ and the permutation expansion of the determinant of its transpose. $ ([ a c b d ]) =ad·([ 1 0 0 1 ]) +cb·([ 0 1 1 0 ]) $ As with the $N by N$ expansions described in the subsection, the permutation matrices from corresponding terms are transposes (although this is disguised by the fact that each is self-transpose).   This problem appears also in the prior subsection.  Find the inverse of each $2$-permutation. Find the inverse of each $3$-permutation.   Each of these is easy to check.   [t] permutation $φ_1$φ_2$  inverse $φ_1$φ_2$   [t] permutation $φ_1$φ_2$φ_3$φ_4$φ_5$φ_6$  inverse $φ_1$φ_2$φ_3$φ_5$φ_4$φ_6$      Find the signum of each $2$-permutation. Find the signum of each $3$-permutation.    $ sgn((φ_1)=+1 $, $ sgn(φ_2)=-1 $) $ sgn((φ_1)=+1 $, $ sgn(φ_2)=-1 $,) $ sgn((φ_3)=-1 $, $ sgn(φ_4)=+1 $,) $ sgn((φ_5)=+1 $, $ sgn(φ_6)=-1 $)    Find the only nonzero term in the permutation expansion of this matrix. $ ([ 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 ]) $ Compute that determinant by finding the signum of the associated permutation.  To get a nonzero term in the permutation expansion we must use the $ 1,2 $ entry and the $ 4,3 $ entry. Having fixed on those two we must also use the $ 2,1 $ entry and the $ 3,4 $ entry. The signum of $ 2,1,4,3 $ is $ +1 $ because from $ ([ 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 ]) $ the two row swaps $ρ_1↔ρ_2$ and $ρ_3↔ρ_4$ will produce the identity matrix.    What is the signum of the $n$-permutation $ φ=n,n-1,...,2,1 $?  The pattern is this.  [b] $ i $ 1 $ 2 $ 3 $ 4 $ 5 $ $ 6 $ ...  $ sgn((φ_i) $ +1 $ -1 $ -1 $ +1 $) $ +1 $ -1 $ ...   So to find the signum of $φ_{n!}$, we subtract one $n!-1$ and look at the remainder on division by four. If the remainder is $1$ or $2$ then the signum is $-1$, otherwise it is $+1$. For $n>4$, the number $n!$ is divisible by four, so $n!-1$ leaves a remainder of $-1$ on division by four (more properly said, a remainder or $3$), and so the signum is $+1$. The $n=1$ case has a signum of $+1$, the $n=2$ case has a signum of $-1$ and the $n=3$ case has a signum of $-1$.   Prove these.  Every permutation has an inverse. $ sgn((φ^){-1})=sgn((φ) $) Every permutation is the inverse of another.    We can view permutations as maps $ map(φ){{1,...,n}}{{1,...,n}} $ that are one-to-one and onto. Any one-one and onto map has an inverse. If it always takes an odd number of swaps to get from $ P_φ $ to the identity, then it always takes an odd number of swaps to get from the identity to $ P_φ $ (any swap is reversible). This is the first question again.    Prove that the matrix of the permutation inverse is the transpose of the matrix of the permutation $P_{φ^{-1}}=trans{P_{φ}}$, for any permutation $φ$.  If $φ(i)=j$ then $φ^{-1}(j)=i$. The result now follows on the observation that $P_{φ}$ has a $1$ in entry $i,j$ if and only if $φ(i)=j$, and $P_{φ^{-1}}$ has a $1$ in entry $j,i$ if and only if $φ^{-1}(j)=i$,   Show that a permutation matrix with $ m $ inversions can be row swapped to the identity in $ m $ steps. Contrast this with .  This does not say that $ m $ is the least number of swaps to produce an identity, nor does it say that $ m $ is the most. It instead says that there is a way to swap to the identity in exactly $ m $ steps.  Let $ ι_j $ be the first row that is inverted with respect to a prior row and let $ ι_k $ be the first row giving that inversion. We have this interval of rows. $ ([ ... ι_k ι_{r_1} ... ι_{r_s} ι_j ... ]) j<k<r_1<... <r_s $ Swap. $ ([ ... ι_j ι_{r_1} ... ι_{r_s} ι_k ... ]) $ The second matrix has one fewer inversion because there is one fewer inversion in the interval ($ s $ vs. $ s+1 $) and inversions involving rows outside the interval are not affected.  Proceed in this way, at each step reducing the number of inversions by one with each row swap. When no inversions remain the result is the identity.  The contrast with is that the statement of this exercise is a `there exists' statement: there exists a way to swap to the identity in exactly~$m$ steps. But the corollary is a `for all' statement: for all ways to swap to the identity, the parity (evenness or oddness) is the same.   For any permutation $φ$ let $g(φ)$ be the integer defined in this way. $ g(φ)=prod(_){i<j} [φ(j)-φ(i)] $ (This is the product, over all indices $ i $ and $ j $ with $ i<j $, of terms of the given form.)  Compute the value of $g$ on all $2$-permutations. Compute the value of $g$ on all $3$-permutations. Prove that $g(φ)$ is not $0$. Prove this. $ sgn((φ)=(g(φ)/|g(φ)|)) $  Many authors give this formula as the definition of the signum function.   First, $g(φ_1)$ is the product of the single factor $2-1$ and so $g(φ_1)=1$. Second, $g(φ_2)$ is the product of the single factor $1-2$ and so $g(φ_2)=-1$.  [t] permutation $φ$ $φ_{1}$φ_{2}$φ_{3}$ $φ_{4}$φ_{5}$φ_{6}$  $g(φ)$2$-2$-2$2$2$-2$  It is a product of nonzero terms. Note that $ φ(j)-φ(i) $ is negative if and only if $ ι_{φ(j)} $ and $ ι_{φ(i)} $ are in an inversion of their usual order.                                                    The prior section develops the determinant algebraically, by considering formulas satisfying certain conditions. This section complements that with a geometric approach. Beyond its intuitive appeal, an advantage of this approach is that while we have so far only considered whether or not a determinant is zero, here we shall give a meaning to the value of the determinant. (The prior section treats the determinant as a function of the rows but this section focuses on columns.)            This parallelogram picture is familiar from the construction of the sum of the two vectors.       In $ ℝ^n$ the box (or parallelepiped ) formed by $ sequence{vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_n} $ is the set $ {t_1vec{{v}_1+...+t_nvec{{v}_n such that t_1,...,t_n in [0, 1]} $.    Thus the parallelogram above is the box formed by $sequence((x_1 choose y_1),(x_2 choose y_2))$. A three-space box is shown in .  We can find the area of the above box by drawing an enclosing rectangle and subtracting away areas not in the box.  { }  {  $$ area of parallelogram  =area of rectangle -area of $A$-area of $B$  -·s-area of $F$  =(x_1+x_2)(y_1+y_2)-x_2y_1-x_1y_1/2  -x_2y_2/2-x_2y_2/2-x_1y_1/2-x_2y_1  =x_1y_2-x_2y_1 $$ }  That the area equals the value of the determinant $ ([ x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2 ]) =x_1y_2-x_2y_1 $ is no coincidence. The definition of determinants contains four properties that we know lead to a unique function for each dimension~$n$. We shall argue that these properties make good postulates for a function that measure the size of boxes in $n$-space.  For instance, a function that measures the size of the box should have the property that multiplying one of the box-defining vectors by a scalar will multiply the size by that scalar.      Shown here is $k=1.4$. On the right the rescaled region is in solid lines with the original region shaded for comparison.       That is, we can reasonably expect that $size(...,kvec(v),...)=k·size(...,vec(v),...)$. Of course, this condition is one of those in the definition of determinants.  Another property of determinants that should apply to any function measuring the size of a box is that it is unaffected by row combinations. Here are before-combining and after-combining boxes (the scalar shown is $k=-0.35$).      The box formed by $v$ and $kvec(v)+vec(w)$ slants differently than the original one but the two have the same base and the same height, and hence the same area.   So we expect that size is not affected by a shear operation $size(...,vec(v),...,vec(w),...) =size(...,vec(v),...,kvec(v)+vec(w),...)$. Again, this is a determinant condition.  We expect that the box formed by unit vectors has unit size    and we naturally extend that to any $n$-space $size(vec(e)_1,...,vec(e)_n)=1$.   Condition~(2) of the definition of determinant is redundant, as remarked following the definition. We know from the prior section that for each~$n$ the determinant exists and is unique so we know that these postulates for size functions are consistent and that we do not need any more postulates. Therefore, we are justified in interpreting $ det(vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_n) $ as giving the size of the box formed by the vectors.      Although condition~(2) is redundant it raises an important point. Consider these two.    [.25ex] $([ 4 1 2 3 ])=10$ $([ 1 4 3 2 ])=-10$   Swapping the columns changes the sign. On the left, starting with $vec(u)$ and following the arc inside the angle to $vec(v)$ (that is, going counterclockwise), we get a positive size. On the right, starting at $vec(v)$ and going to~$vec(u)$, and so following the clockwise arc, gives a negative size. The sign returned by the size function reflects the orientation or sense of the box. (We see the same thing if we picture the effect of scalar multiplication by a negative scalar.)        The volume of a box is the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix with those vectors as columns.    For example By the formula that takes the area of the base times the height, the volume of this parallelepiped is $12$. That agrees with the determinant.  { }   $([ 2 0 -1 0 3 0 2 1 1 ])=12$  We can also compute the volume as the absolute value of this determinant. $ ([ 0 2 0 3 0 3 1 2 1 ])=-12 $          A transformation $ t: ℝ^n → ℝ^n $ changes the size of all boxes by the same factor, namely, the size of the image of a box $determinant(t(S))$ is $determinant(T)$ times the size of the box $determinant(S)$, where $T$ is the matrix representing $t$ with respect to the standard basis.  That is, the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants $determinant(TS)=determinant(T)·determinant(S)$.    The two sentences say the same thing, first in map terms and then in matrix terms. This is because $determinant(t(S))=determinant(TS)$, as both give the size of the box that is the image of the unit box $stdbasis(_n)$ under the composition $∘{t}{s}$, where the maps are represented with respect to the standard basis. We will prove the second sentence.    First consider the case that $T$ is singular and thus does not have an inverse. Observe that if $ TS $ is invertible then there is an $M$ such that $ (TS)M=I $, so $ T(SM)=I $, and so $ T $ is invertible. The contrapositive of that observation is that if $ T $ is not invertible then neither is $ TS $ - if $determinant(T)=0$ then $determinant(TS)=0$.    Now consider the case that $T$ is nonsingular. Any nonsingular matrix factors into a product of elementary matrices $T=E_1E_2·s E_r$. To finish this argument we will verify that $ determinant(ES)=determinant(E)·determinant(S) $ for all matrices~$S$ and elementary matrices~$E$. The result will then follow because $determinant(TS)=determinant(E_1·s E_rS)=determinant(E_1)·sdeterminant(E_r)·determinant(S) =determinant(E_1·s E_r)·determinant(S)=determinant(T)·determinant(S)$.    There are three types of elementary matrix. We will cover the $M_i(k)$ case; the $P_{i,j}$ and $C_{i,j}(k)$ checks are similar. The matrix $M_i(k)S$ equals $S$ except that row~$i$ is multiplied by $k$. The third condition of determinant functions then gives that $determinant(M_i(k)S)=k·determinant(S)$. But $determinant(M_i(k))=k$, again by the third condition because $M_i(k)$ is derived from the identity by multiplication of row~$i$ by $k$. Thus $ determinant(ES)=determinant(E)·determinant(S) $ holds for $E=M_i(k)$.     For example Application of the map $t$ represented with respect to the standard bases by $ ([ 1 1 -2 0 ]) $ will double sizes of boxes, e.g., from this  { }  $([ 2 1 1 2 ])=3$  to this  { }  $([ 3 3 -4 -2 ])=6$             If a matrix is invertible then the determinant of its inverse is the inverse of its determinant $deter{T^{-1}}=1/determinant(T)$.      $1=determinant(I)=deter{TT^{-1}}=determinant(T)·deter{T^{-1}}$       Find the volume of the region defined by the vectors.  $[1 3],[-1 4]$ $sequence{[2 1 0],[3 -2 4], [8 -3 8]}$ $sequence{[1 2 0 1], [2 2 2 2], [-1 3 0 5], [0 1 0 7]}$   For each, find the determinant and take the absolute value.  $7$ $0$ $58$    Is $ [4 1 2] $ inside of the box formed by these three? $ [3 3 1]  [2 6 1]  [1 0 5] $  Solving $ c_1[3 3 1] +c_2[2 6 1] +c_3[1 0 5] =[4 1 2] $ gives the unique solution $ c_3=11/57 $, $ c_2=-40/57 $ and $ c_1=99/57 $. Because $ c_1>1 $, the vector is not in the box.   Find the volume of this region.     Move the parallelepiped to start at the origin, so that it becomes the box formed by $ sequence{ [3 0], [2 1] } $ and now the absolute value of this determinant is easily computed as $3$. $ ([ 3 2 0 1 ])=3 $   Suppose that $ determinant(A)=3 $. By what factor do these change volumes?  $ A $ $ A^2 $ $ A^{-2} $    $ 3 $ $ 9 $ $1/9$    Consider the linear transformation of~$ ℝ^3$ represented with respect to the standard bases by this matrix. $ ([ 1 0 -1 3 1 1 -1 0 3 ]) $  Compute the determinant of the matrix. Does the transformation preserve orientation or reverse it? Find the size of the box defined by these vectors. What is its orientation? $ [1 -1 2]  [2 0 -1]  [1 1 0] $ Find the images under $t$ of the vectors in the prior item and find the size of the box that they define. What is the orientation?     Gauss's Method $ for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 1 0 -1 0 1 4 0 0 2 ]) $ gives the determinant as~$+2$. The sign is positive so the transformation preserves orientation.  The size of the box is the value of this determinant. $ ([ 1 2 1 -1 0 1 2 -1 0 ]) =+6 $ The orientation is positive.  Since this transformation is represented by the given matrix with respect to the standard bases, and with respect to the standard basis the vectors represent themselves, to find the image of the vectors under the transformation just multiply them, from the left, by the matrix. $ [1 -1 2]↦[-1 4 5]  [2 0 -1]↦[3 5 -5]  [1 1 0]↦[1 4 -1] $ Then compute the size of the resulting box. $ ([ -1 3 1 4 5 4 5 -5 -1 ]) =+12 $ The starting box is positively oriented, the transformation preserves orientations (since the determinant of the matrix is positive), and the ending box is also positively oriented.    By what factor does each transformation change the size of boxes?  $[x y]↦[2x 3y]$ $[x y]↦[3x-y -2x+y]$ $[x y z]↦[x-y x+y+z y-2z]$   Express each transformation with respect to the standard bases and find the determinant.  $6$ $-1$ $-5$    What is the area of the image of the rectangle $ [2..4]× [2..5] $ under the action of this matrix? $ ([ 2 3 4 -1 ]) $  The starting area is $ 6 $ and the matrix changes sizes by $ -14 $. Thus the area of the image is $ 84 $.   If $ t: ℝ^3 → ℝ^3 $ changes volumes by a factor of $ 7 $ and $ s: ℝ^3 → ℝ^3 $ changes volumes by a factor of $ 3/2 $ then by what factor will their composition changes volumes?  By a factor of $ 21/2 $.   In what way does the definition of a box differ from the definition of a span?  For a box we take a sequence of vectors (as described in the remark, the order of the vectors matters), while for a span we take a set of vectors. Also, for a box subset of $ ℝ^n$ there must be $n$ vectors; of course for a span there can be any number of vectors. Finally, for a box the coefficients $t_1$,~..., $t_n$ are in the interval $[0..1]$, while for a span the coefficients are free to range over all of $ ℝ$.   Why doesn't this picture contradict ?    raisebox(12pt){$ grstep{[(([ 2 1 0 1 ])])} $}  area is $2$ determinant is $2$ area is $5$    We have drawn that picture to mislead. The picture on the left is not the box formed by two vectors. If we slide it to the origin then it becomes the box formed by this sequence. $ sequence{ [0 1], [2 0] } $ Then the image under the action of the matrix is the box formed by this sequence. $ sequence{ [1 1], [4 0] } $ which has an area of $4$.   Does $ determinant(TS)=determinant(ST) $? $ determinant(T(SP))=determinant((TS)P) $?  Yes to both. For instance, the first is $ determinant(TS)=determinant(T)·determinant(S)= determinant(S)·determinant(T)=determinant(ST) $.  Show that there are no $N by N$ matrices $A$ and~$B$ satisfying these. $ AB=([ 1 -1 2 0 ])  BA=([ 2 1 1 1 ]) $  Because $determinant(AB)=determinant(A)·determinant(B)=determinant(BA)$ and these two matrices have different determinants.    Suppose that $ determinant(A)=3 $ and that $ determinant(B)=2 $. Find $ deter{A^2· Bᵀ· B^{-2}· Aᵀ } $. Assume that $ determinant(A)=0 $. Prove that $ determinant(6A^3+5A^2+2A)=0 $.    If it is defined then it is $ (3^2)· (2)· (2^{-2})· (3) $. $ determinant(6A^3+5A^2+2A)=determinant(A)·determinant(6A^2+5A+2I) $.    Let $ T $ be the matrix representing (with respect to the standard bases) the map that rotates plane vectors counterclockwise thru $ θ $ radians. By what factor does $ T $ change sizes?  $([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) sin(θ) cos(θ) ])=1 $   Must a transformation $ t: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2 $ that preserves areas also preserve lengths?  No, for instance the determinant of $ T=([ 2 0 0 1/2 ]) $ is $ 1 $ so it preserves areas, but the vector $ Tvec(e)_1 $ has length $ 2 $.   What is the volume of a parallelepiped in $ ℝ^3 $ bounded by a linearly dependent set?  It is zero.   Find the area of the triangle in $ ℝ^3 $ with endpoints $ (1,2,1) $, $ (3,-1,4) $, and $ (2,2,2) $. (Area, not volume. The triangle defines a plane- what is the area of the triangle in that plane?)  Two of the three sides of the triangle are formed by these vectors. $ [2 2 2]-[1 2 1]=[1 0 1]  [3 -1 4]-[1 2 1]=[2 -3 3] $ One way to find the area of this triangle is to produce a length-one vector orthogonal to these two. From these two relations $ [1 0 1] ·[x y z] =[0 0 0]  [2 -3 3] ·[x y z] =[0 0 0] $ we get a system $ $ x + z = 0 2x - 3y + 3z = 0 $ for step $-2ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ x + z = 0 -3y + z = 0 $ $ with this solution set. $ {[-1 1/3 1]z such that z in ℝ}, $ A solution of length one is this. $ frac(1){√{19/9}}[-1 1/3 1] $ Thus the area of the triangle is the absolute value of this determinant. $ ([ 1 2 -3/√{19} 0 -3 1/√{19} 1 3 3/√{19} ]) =-12/√{19} $   An alternate proof of uses the definition of determinant functions.  Note that the vectors forming $S$ make a linearly dependent set if and only if $determinant(S)=0$, and check that the result holds in this case. For the $determinant(S) ≠ 0$ case, to show that $determinant(TS)/determinant(S)=determinant(T)$ for all transformations, consider the function $ map(d){matspace(_){N by N}}{ ℝ} $ given by $ T↦ determinant(TS)/determinant(S) $. Show that $d$ has the first property of a determinant. Show that $d$ has the remaining three properties of a determinant function. Conclude that $determinant(TS)=determinant(T)·determinant(S)$.    Because the image of a linearly dependent set is linearly dependent, if the vectors forming $S$ make a linearly dependent set, so that $determinant(S)=0$, then the vectors forming $t(S)$ make a linearly dependent set, so that $determinant(TS)=0$, and in this case the equation holds. We must check that if $Tsmash[b]{for step $kρ_i+ρ_j$}T̂$ then $d(T)=determinant(TS)/determinant(S)=deter(T̂S)/determinant(S)=d(T̂)$. We can do this by checking that combining rows first and then multiplying to get $ T̂S $ gives the same result as multiplying first to get $ TS $ and then combining (because the determinant $ determinant(TS) $ is unaffected by the combining rows so we'll then have that $ deter(T̂S)=determinant(TS) $ and hence that $ d(T̂)=d(T) $). This check runs:~after adding $ k $ times row~$ i $ of $ TS $ to row~$j$ of $ TS $, the $ j,p $ entry is $ (kt_{i,1}+t_{j,1})s_{1,p}+...+(kt_{i,r}+t_{j,r})s_{r,p} $, which is the $ j,p $ entry of $ T̂S $. For the second property, we need only check that swapping $Tsmash[b]{for step $ρ_i ↔ ρ_j$}T̂$ and then multiplying to get $ T̂S $ gives the same result as multiplying $ T $ by $ S $ first and then swapping (because, as the determinant $ determinant(TS) $ changes sign on the row swap, we'll then have $ deter(T̂S)=-determinant(TS) $, and so $ d(T̂)=-d(T) $). This check runs just like the one for the first property.  For the third property, we need only show that performing $Tsmash[b]{for step $kρ_i$}T̂$ and then computing $ T̂S $ gives the same result as first computing $ TS $ and then performing the scalar multiplication (as the determinant $ determinant(TS) $ is rescaled by $ k $, we'll have $ deter(T̂S)=kdeterminant(TS) $ and so $ d(T̂)=kd(T) $). Here too, the argument runs just as above.  The fourth property, that if $T$ is $I$ then the result is $1$, is obvious. Determinant functions are unique, so $ determinant(TS)/determinant(S)=d(T)=determinant(T) $, and so $determinant(TS)=determinant(T)determinant(S)$.               Give a non-identity matrix with the property that $ Aᵀ=A^{-1} $. Show that if $ Aᵀ=A^{-1} $ then $ determinant(A)=± 1 $. Does the converse hold?  Any permutation matrix has the property that the transpose of the matrix is its inverse.  For the implication, we know that $ determinant(Aᵀ)=determinant(A) $. Then $ 1=deter{A· A^{-1}}=determinant(A·Aᵀ) =determinant(A)·determinant(Aᵀ)=determinant(A)^2 $.  The converse does not hold; here is an example. $ ([ 3 1 2 1 ]) $   The algebraic property of determinants that factoring a scalar out of a single row will multiply the determinant by that scalar shows that where $ H $ is $ N by N $, the determinant of $ cH $ is $ c^3 $ times the determinant of $ H $. Explain this geometrically, that is, using . (The observation that increasing the linear size of a three-dimensional object by a factor of $c$ will increase its volume by a factor of $c^3$ while only increasing its surface area by an amount proportional to a factor of $c^2$ is the Square-cube law~.)  Where the sides of the box are $ c $ times longer, the box has $ c^3 $ times as many cubic units of volume.   We say that matrices $H$ and $G$ are similar if there is a nonsingular matrix $P$ such that $H=P^{-1}GP$ (we will study this relation in Chapter Five). Show that similar matrices have the same determinant.  If $ H=P^{-1}GP $ then $ determinant(H)=deter{P^{-1}}determinant(G)determinant(P) =deter{P^{-1}}determinant(P)determinant(G)=deter{P^{-1}P}determinant(G) =determinant(G) $.   We usually represent vectors in $ ℝ^2 $ with respect to the standard basis so vectors in the first quadrant have both coordinates positive.  { }  $ rep{vec(v)}{stdbasis(_2)}=[+3 +2] $  Moving counterclockwise around the origin, we cycle thru four regions: { $ ·s -->[+ +] -->[- +] -->[- -] -->[+ -] -->·s. $ } Using this basis  $ B=[0 1],[-1 0] $  { }  gives the same counterclockwise cycle. We say these two bases have the same orientation.  Why do they give the same cycle? What other configurations of unit vectors on the axes give the same cycle? Find the determinants of the matrices formed from those (ordered) bases. What other counterclockwise cycles are possible, and what are the associated determinants? What happens in $ ℝ^1 $? What happens in $ ℝ^3 $?  A fascinating general-audience discussion of orientations is in .   The new basis is the old basis rotated by $ π/4 $.  $ sequence{[-1 0], [0 -1]} $, $ sequence{[0 -1], [1 0]} $ In each case the determinant is $ +1 $ (we say that these bases have positive orientation). Because only one sign can change at a time, the only other cycle possible is $ ·s -->[+ +] -->[+ -] -->[- -] -->[- +] -->·s. $ Here each associated determinant is $ -1 $ (we say that such bases have a negative orientation). There is one positively oriented basis $ (1) $ and one negatively oriented basis $ (-1) $. There are $ 48 $ bases ($ 6 $ half-axis choices are possible for the first unit vector, $ 4 $ for the second, and $ 2 $ for the last). Half are positively oriented like the standard basis on the left below, and half are negatively oriented like the one on the right      In $ ℝ^3 $ positive orientation is sometimes called `right hand orientation' because if a person places their right hand with their fingers curling from $ vec(e)_1 $ to $ vec(e)_2 $ then the thumb will point with $ vec(e)_3 $.                        textit{This question uses material from the optional Determinant Functions Exist subsection.} Prove by using the permutation expansion formula for the determinant.  We will compare $ det(vec(s)_1,...,vec(s)_n) $ with $ det(t(vec(s)_1),...,t(vec(s)_n)) $ to show that the second differs from the first by a factor of $determinant(T)$. We represent the $ vec(s) $'s with respect to the standard bases $ rep{vec(s)_i}{stdbasis(_n)}= [s_{1,i] s_{2,i} ... s_{n,i}} $ and then we represent the map application with matrix-vector multiplication $ rep{t(vec(s)_i)}{stdbasis(_n)} =general_matrix(t, n, n) [s_{1,j] s_{2,j} ... s_{n,j}} =s_{1,j}[t_{1,1] t_{2,1} ... t_{n,1}} +s_{2,j}[t_{1,2] t_{2,2} ... t_{n,2}} +... +s_{n,j}[t_{1,n] t_{2,n} ... t_{n,n}} =s_{1,j}vec(t)_1+s_{2,j}vec(t)_2+...+s_{n,j}vec(t)_n $ where $ vec(t)_i $ is column~$i$ of $ T $. Then $det(t(vec(s)_1),...,t(vec(s)_n))$ equals $ det(s_{1,1}vec(t)_1+s_{2,1}vec(t)_2 +...+s_{n,1}vec(t)_n, ..., s_{1,n}vec(t)_1+s_{2,n}vec(t)_2 +...+s_{n,n}vec(t)_n) $.  As in the derivation of the permutation expansion formula, we apply multilinearity, first splitting along the sum in the first argument $ det(s_{1,1}vec(t)_1, ..., s_{1,n}vec(t)_1+s_{2,n}vec(t)_2+...+s_{n,n}vec(t)_n) +·s{} +det(s_{n,1}vec(t)_n, ..., s_{1,n}vec(t)_1+s_{2,n}vec(t)_2+...+s_{n,n}vec(t)_n) $ and then splitting each of those $n$ summands along the sums in the second arguments, etc. We end with, as in the derivation of the permutation expansion, $ n^n $ summand determinants, each of the form $det(s_{i_1,1}vec(t)_{i_1},s_{i_2,2}vec(t)_{i_2}, ..., s_{i_n,n}vec(t)_{i_n})$. Factor out each of the $s_{i,j}$'s $= s_{i_1,1}s_{i_2,2}... s_{i_n,n} ·det(vec(t)_{i_1},vec(t)_{i_2}, ..., vec(t)_{i_n}) $.  As in the permutation expansion derivation, whenever two of the indices in $i_1$, ..., $i_n$ are equal then the determinant has two equal arguments, and evaluates to $0$. So we need only consider the cases where $i_1$, ..., $i_n$ form a permutation of the numbers $1$, ..., $n$. We thus have $ det(t(vec(s)_1),...,t(vec(s)_n))= ∑_{permutations φ} s_{φ(1),1}... s_{φ(n),n} det(vec(t)_{φ(1)},...,vec(t)_{φ(n)}). $ Swap the columns in $det(vec(t)_{φ(1)},...,vec(t)_{φ(n)})$ to get the matrix $ T $ back, which changes the sign by a factor of $sgn(φ)$, and then factor out the determinant of $T$. $ =∑_φ s_{φ(1),1}... s_{φ(n),n} det(vec(t)_1,...,vec(t)_n)·sgn(φ) =det(T)∑_φ s_{φ(1),1}... s_{φ(n),n}·sgn(φ). $ As in the proof that the determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its transpose, we commute the $s$'s to list them by ascending row number instead of by ascending column number (and we substitute $sgn((φ^){-1})$ for $sgn((φ)$).) $ =det(T)∑_φ s_{1,φ^{-1}(1)}... s_{n,φ^{-1}(n)}·sgn(φ^){-1}} =det(T)det(vec(s)_1,vec(s)_2,...,vec(s)_n) $                          Show that this gives the equation of a line in $ ℝ^2 $ thru $ (x_2,y_2) $ and $ (x_3,y_3) $. $ ([ x x_2 x_3 y y_2 y_3 1 1 1 ])=0 $  Prove that the area of a triangle with vertices $ (x_1,y_1) $, $ (x_2,y_2) $, and $ (x_3,y_3) $ is $ (1/2) ([ x_1 x_2 x_3 y_1 y_2 y_3 1 1 1 ]). $  Prove that the area of a triangle with vertices at $ (x_1,y_1) $, $ (x_2,y_2) $, and $ (x_3,y_3) $ whose coordinates are integers has an area of $ N $ or $ N/2 $ for some positive integer $ N $.    An algebraic check is easy. $ 0 =xy_2+x_2y_3+x_3y-x_3y_2-xy_3-x_2y =x· (y_2-y_3)+y· (x_3-x_2)+x_2y_3-x_3y_2 $ simplifies to the familiar form $ y=x· (x_3-x_2)/(y_3-y_2)+(x_2y_3-x_3y_2)/(y_3-y_2) $ (the $y_3-y_2=0$ case is easily handled).  For geometric insight, this picture shows that the box formed by the three vectors. Note that all three vectors end in the $z=1$ plane. Below the two vectors on the right is the line through $(x_2,y_2)$ and $(x_3,y_3)$.    The box will have a nonzero volume unless the triangle formed by the ends of the three is degenerate. That only happens (assuming that $(x_2,y_3) ≠ (x_3,y_3)$) if $(x,y)$ lies on the line through the other two.  We find the altitude through $(x_1,y_1)$ of a triangle with vertices $(x_1,y_1)$(x_2,y_2)$ and $(x_3,y_3)$ in the usual way from the normal form of the above: $ frac(1){√{(x_2-x_3)^2+(y_2-y_3)^2}} ([ x_1 x_2 x_3 y_1 y_2 y_3 1 1 1 ]). $ Another step shows the area of the triangle to be $ (1/2) ([ x_1 x_2 x_3 y_1 y_2 y_3 1 1 1 ]). $ This exposition reveals the modus operandi more clearly than the usual proof of showing a collection of terms to be identical with the determinant.  Let $ D= ([ x_1 x_2 x_3 y_1 y_2 y_3 1 1 1 ]) $ then the area of the triangle is $(1/2)determinant(D)$. Now if the coordinates are all integers, then $D$ is an integer.            Determinants are a font of interesting and amusing formulas. Here is one that is often used to compute determinants by hand.          The example shows a $N by N$ case but the approach works for any size~$n>1$.  For example  Consider the permutation expansion. $ ([ t_{1,1} t_{1,2} t_{1,3} t_{2,1} t_{2,2} t_{2,3} t_{3,1} t_{3,2} t_{3,3} ]) =$[t] t_{1,1}t_{2,2}t_{3,3}([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{1,1}t_{2,3}t_{3,2}([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ])  +t_{1,2}t_{2,1}t_{3,3}([ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{1,2}t_{2,3}t_{3,1}([ 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ])  +t_{1,3}t_{2,1}t_{3,2}([ 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) +t_{1,3}t_{2,2}t_{3,1}([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]) $ $ Pick a row or column and factor out its entries; here we do the entries in the first row.    $ =t_{1,1}· [t_{2,2}t_{3,3}([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{2,3}t_{3,2}([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ])]  +t_{1,2}· [t_{2,1}t_{3,3}([ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{2,3}t_{3,1}([ 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ])]  +t_{1,3}· [t_{2,1}t_{3,2}([ 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) +t_{2,2}t_{3,1}([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 ])] $ In those permutation matrices, swap to get the first rows into place. This requires one swap to each of the permutation matrices on the second line, and two swaps to each on the third line. (Recall that row swaps change the sign of the determinant.)   $ =t_{1,1}· [t_{2,2}t_{3,3}([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{2,3}t_{3,2}([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ])]  -t_{1,2}· [t_{2,1}t_{3,3}([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{2,3}t_{3,1}([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ])]  +t_{1,3}· [t_{2,1}t_{3,2}([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) +t_{2,2}t_{3,1}([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ])] $   On each line the terms in square brackets involve only the second and third row and column, and simplify to a $N by N$ determinant. $ =t_{1,1}· ([ t_{2,2} t_{2,3} t_{3,2} t_{3,3} ]) -t_{1,2}· ([ t_{2,1} t_{2,3} t_{3,1} t_{3,3} ]) +t_{1,3}· ([ t_{2,1} t_{2,2} t_{3,1} t_{3,2} ]) $    The formula given in , which generalizes this example, is a recurrence - the determinant is expressed as a combination of determinants. This formula isn't circular because it gives the $N by N$ case in terms of smaller ones.     For any $ N by N $ matrix $ T $, the $ N by (n-1) $ matrix formed by deleting row~$ i $ and column~$ j $ of $ T $ is the $ i,j $ minor  of $ T $. The $ i,j $ cofactor  $ T_{i,j} $ of $ T $ is $ (-1)^{i+j} $ times the determinant of the $ i,j $ minor of $ T $.    For example The $1,2$ cofactor of the matrix from is the negative of the second $N by N$ determinant. $ T_{1,2}= -1·([ t_{2,1} t_{2,3} t_{3,1} t_{3,3} ]) $   For example Where $ T= ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]) $ these are the $ 1,2 $ and $ 2,2 $ cofactors. $ T_{1,2}= (-1)^{1+2}·([ 4 6 7 9 ])=6  T_{2,2}= (-1)^{2+2}·([ 1 3 7 9 ])=-12 $   [Laplace Expansion of Determinants]     Where $ T $ is an $ N by N $ matrix, we can find the determinant by expanding by cofactors on any row~$i$ or column~$j$. $ determinant(T) =t_{i,1}· T_{i,1}+t_{i,2}· T_{i,2}+·s+t_{i,n}· T_{i,n} =t_{1,j}· T_{1,j}+t_{2,j}· T_{2,j}+·s+t_{n,j}· T_{n,j} $     .   For example We can compute the determinant $ determinant(T)= ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]) $ by expanding along the first row, as in . $ determinant(T) =1·(+1)([ 5 6 8 9 ]) +2·(-1)([ 4 6 7 9 ]) +3·(+1)([ 4 5 7 8 ]) =-3+12-9 =0 $ Or, we could expand down the second column. $ determinant(T) =2·(-1)([ 4 6 7 9 ]) +5·(+1)([ 1 3 7 9 ]) +8·(-1)([ 1 3 4 6 ]) =12-60+48 =0 $   For example A row or column with many zeroes suggests a Laplace expansion. $ ([ 1 5 0 2 1 1 3 -1 0 ]) = 0·(+1)([ 2 1 3 -1 ])+ 1·(-1)([ 1 5 3 -1 ])+ 0·(+1)([ 1 5 2 1 ]) =16 $   We finish by applying Laplace's expansion to derive a new formula for the inverse of a matrix. With , we can calculate the determinant of a matrix by taking linear combinations of entries from a row with their associated cofactors. $ t_{i,1}· T_{i,1}+t_{i,2}· T_{i,2}+...+t_{i,n}· T_{i,n} =determinant(T) $ Recall that a matrix with two identical rows has a zero determinant. Thus, weighing the cofactors by entries from row~$k$ with $k ≠ i$ gives zero $ t_{i,1}· T_{k,1}+t_{i,2}· T_{k,2}+...+t_{i,n}· T_{k,n}=0 $ because it represents the expansion along the row~$k$ of a matrix with row~$ i $ equal to row~$ k $.

No. Here is a determinant whose value $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ])=1 $ doesn't equal the result of expanding down the diagonal. $ 1· (+1)([ 1 0 0 1 ]) +1· (+1)([ 1 0 0 1 ]) +1· (+1)([ 1 0 0 1 ])=3 $   Give a formula for the adjoint of a diagonal matrix.  Consider this diagonal matrix. $ D= ([ d_1 0 0 ... 0 d_2 0 0 0 d_3 ... d_n ]) $ If $i ≠ j$ then the $i,j$~minor is an $N by (n-1)$ matrix with only $n-2$ nonzero entries, because we have deleted both $d_i$ and $d_j$. Thus, at least one row or column of the minor is all zeroes, and so the cofactor $D_{i,j}$ is zero. If $i=j$ then the minor is the diagonal matrix with entries $d_1$, ..., $d_{i-1}$, $d_{i+1}$, ..., $d_n$. Its determinant is obviously $(-1)^{i+j}=(-1)^{2i}=1$ times the product of those. $ adj((D)) = ([ d_2·s d_n 0 0 0 d_1d_3·s d_n 0 ... d_1·s d_{n-1} ]) $  By the way, provides a slicker way to derive this conclusion.   Prove that the transpose of the adjoint is the adjoint of the transpose.  Just note that if $S=Tᵀ$ then the cofactor $S_{j,i}$ equals the cofactor $T_{i,j}$ because $(-1)^{j+i}=(-1)^{i+j}$ and because the minors are the transposes of each other (and the determinant of a transpose equals the determinant of the matrix).   Prove or disprove: $ adj((adj(T))=T $.)  It is false; here is an example. $ T=([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ])  adj((T)=([) -3 6 -3 6 -12 6 -3 6 -3 ])  adj((adj(T))=([) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $   A square matrix is upper triangular if each $ i,j $ entry is zero in the part above the diagonal, that is, when $ i>j $.   Must the adjoint of an upper triangular matrix be upper triangular? Lower triangular? Prove that the inverse of a upper triangular matrix is upper triangular, if an inverse exists.    An example $ M= ([ 1 2 3 0 4 5 0 0 6 ]) $ suggests the right answer. $ adj((M)=) ([ M_{1,1} M_{2,1} M_{3,1} M_{1,2} M_{2,2} M_{3,2} M_{1,3} M_{2,3} M_{3,3} ]) =([ ([ 4 5 0 6 ]) -([ 2 3 0 6 ]) ([ 2 3 4 5 ]) [1.5ex] -([ 0 5 0 6 ]) ([ 1 3 0 6 ]) -([ 1 3 0 5 ]) [1.5ex] ([ 0 4 0 0 ]) -([ 1 2 0 0 ]) ([ 1 2 0 4 ]) ]) = ([ 24 -12 -2 0 6 -5 0 0 4 ]) $ The result is indeed upper triangular.  This check is detailed but not hard. The entries in the upper triangle of the adjoint are $M_{a,b}$ where $a>b$. We need to verify that the cofactor $M_{a,b}$ is zero if $a>b$. With $a>b$, row~$a$ and column~$b$ of $M$, $ ([ m_{1,1} ... m_{1,b} ... m_{2,1} ... m_{2,b} ... ... m_{a,1} ... m_{a,b} ... m_{a,n} ... ... m_{n,b} ]) $ when deleted, leave an upper triangular minor, because entry~$i,j$ of the minor is either entry~$i,j$ of $M$ (this happens if $a>i$ and~$b>j$; in this case $i<j$ implies that the entry is zero) or it is entry~$i,j+1$ of $M$ (this happens if $i<a$ and $j>b$; in this case, $i<j$ implies that $i<j+1$, which implies that the entry is zero), or it is entry~$i+1,j+1$ of $M$ (this last case happens when $i>a$ and~$j>b$; obviously here $i<j$ implies that $i+1<j+1$ and so the entry is zero). Thus the determinant of the minor is the product down the diagonal. Observe that the $a-1,a$ entry of $M$ is the $a-1,a-1$~entry of the minor (it doesn't get deleted because the relation $a>b$ is strict). But this entry is zero because $M$ is upper triangular and $a-1<a$. Therefore the cofactor is zero, and the adjoint is upper triangular. (The lower triangular case is similar.) This is immediate from the prior part, by .     textit{This question requires material from the optional Determinants Exist subsection.} Prove by using the permutation expansion.  We will show that each determinant can be expanded along row~$ i $. The argument for column~$j$ is similar.  Each term in the permutation expansion contains one and only one entry from each row. As in , factor out each row~$i$ entry to get $ determinant(T) =t_{i,1}·T̂_{i,1}+...+t_{i,n}·T̂_{i,n} $, where each $ T̂_{i,j} $ is a sum of terms not containing any elements of row $ i $. We will show that $ T̂_{i,j} $ is the $ i,j $ cofactor.  Consider the $ i,j=n,n $ case first: $ t_{n,n}·T̂_{n,n} =t_{n,n}· ∑_{φ}t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}...t_{n-1,φ(n-1)} sgn((φ)) $ where the sum is over all $ n $-permutations $ φ $ such that $ φ(n)=n $. To show that $ T̂_{i,j} $ is the minor $ T_{i,j} $, we need only show that if $ φ $ is an $ n $-permutation such that $ φ(n)=n $ and $ σ $ is an $ n-1 $-permutation with $ σ(1)=φ(1) $, ..., $ σ(n-1)=φ(n-1) $ then $ sgn((σ)=sgn(φ) $.) But that's true because $φ$ and $σ$ have the same number of inversions.  Back to the general $ i,j $ case. Swap adjacent rows until the $ i $-th is last and swap adjacent columns until the $ j $-th is last. Observe that the determinant of the $ i,j $-th minor is not affected by these adjacent swaps because inversions are preserved (since the minor has the $ i $-th row and $ j $-th column omitted). On the other hand, the sign of $ determinant(T) $ and $ T̂_{i,j} $ changes $ n-i $ plus $ n-j $ times. Thus $ T̂_{i,j}=(-1)^{n-i+n-j}deter{T_{i,j}} =(-1)^{i+j}deter{T_{i,j}} $.   Prove that the determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its transpose using Laplace's expansion and induction on the size of the matrix.  This is obvious for the $ N by N $ base case.  For the inductive case, assume that the determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its transpose for all $ N by N $, ..., $ N by (n-1) $ matrices. Expanding on row~$ i $ gives $ determinant(T)=t_{i,1}T_{i,1}+...+t_{i,n}T_{i,n} $ and expanding on column~$ i $ gives $ determinant(Tᵀ)=t_{1,i}(Tᵀ)_{1,i} +...+t_{n,i}(Tᵀ)_{n,i} $ Since $ (-1)^{i+j}=(-1)^{j+i} $ the signs are the same in the two summations. Since the $ j,i $ minor of $ Tᵀ $ is the transpose of the $ i,j $ minor of $ T $, the inductive hypothesis gives $ deter{(Tᵀ)_{i,j}}=deter{T_{i,j}} $.   Show that $ F_n= ([ 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 ... 1 1 0 1 0 1 ... 0 1 1 0 1 0 ... 0 0 1 1 0 1 ... . . . . . . ... ]) $ where $ F_n $ is the $ n $-th term of $ 1,1,2,3,5,...,x,y,x+y,... $, the Fibonacci sequence, and the determinant is of order $ n-1 $.    Denoting the above determinant by $ D_n $, it is seen that $ D_2=1 $, $ D_3=2 $. It remains to show that $ D_n=D_{n-1}+D_{n-2}, n≥ 4 $. In $ D_n $ subtract the $ (n-3) $-th column from the $ (n-1) $-th, the $ (n-4) $-th from the $ (n-2) $-th, ..., the first from the third, obtaining $ F_n= ([ 1 -1 0 0 0 0 ... 1 1 -1 0 0 0 ... 0 1 1 -1 0 0 ... 0 0 1 1 -1 0 ... . . . . . . ... ]). $ By expanding this determinant with reference to the first row, there results the desired relation.                                A linear system is equivalent to a linear relationship among vectors. $ $ x_1 + 2x_2 = 6 3x_1 + x_2 = 8 $   Longleftrightarrow x_1·[1 3]+x_2·[2 1]=[6 8] $  In the picture below the small parallelogram is formed from sides that are the vectors $(1 choose 3)$ and $(2 choose 1)$. It is nested inside a parallelogram with sides $x_1(1 choose 3)$ and~$x_2(2 choose 1)$. By the vector equation, the far corner of the larger parallelogram is $(6 choose 8)$.     This drawing restates the algebraic question of finding the solution of a linear system into geometric terms:~by what factors $x_1$ and~$x_2$ must we dilate the sides of the starting parallelogram so that it will fill the other one?   We can use this picture, and our geometric understanding of determinants, to get a new formula for solving linear systems. Compare the sizes of these shaded boxes.         The second is defined by the vectors $x_1(1 choose 3)$ and $(2 choose 1)$ and one of the properties of the size function- the determinant- is that therefore the size of the second box is $ x_1 $ times the size of the first. The third box is derived from the second by shearing, adding $x_2(2 choose 1)$ to $x_1(1 choose 3)$ to get $x_1(1 choose 3)+x_2(2 choose 1)=(6 choose 8)$, along with $(2 choose 1)$. The determinant is not affected by shearing so the size of the third box equals that of the second.    Taken together we have this. $ x_1· ([ 1 2 3 1 ]) = ([ x_1· 1 2 x_1· 3 1 ]) = ([ x_1· 1+x_2· 2 2 x_1· 3+x_2· 1 1 ]) = ([ 6 2 8 1 ]) $   Solving gives the value of one of the variables. $ x_1= frac{([ 6 2 8 1 ]) }{ ([ 1 2 3 1 ]) } =(-10/-5)=2 $   The generalization of this example is Cramer's Rule:   if $ determinant(A) ≠ 0 $ then the system $ Avec(x)=vec(b) $ has the unique solution $ x_i=determinant(B_i)/determinant(A) $ where the matrix $B_i$ is formed from $A$ by replacing column~$i$ with the vector $ vec(b) $. The proof is .  For instance, to solve this system for $ x_2 $ $ ([ 1 0 4 2 1 -1 1 0 1 ]) [x_1 x_2 x_3] =[2 1 -1] $ we do this computation. $ x_2= frac{ ([ 1 2 4 2 1 -1 1 -1 1 ]) }{ ([ 1 0 4 2 1 -1 1 0 1 ]) } =(-18/-3) $  Cramer's Rule lets us by-eye solve systems that are small and simple. For example, we can solve systems with two equations and two unknowns, or three equations and three unknowns, where the numbers are small integers. Such cases appear often enough that many people find this formula handy.  But using it to solving large or complex systems is not practical, either by hand or by a computer. A Gauss's Method-based approach is faster.    Use Cramer's Rule to solve each for each of the variables.  $$ x - y = 4 -x + 2y = -7 $$ $$ -2x + y = -2 x - 2y = -2 $$    Solve for the variables separately. $ x= frac{ ([ 4 -1 -7 2 ]) }{ ([ 1 -1 -1 2 ]) } =(1/1)=1  y= frac{ ([ 1 4 -1 -7 ]) }{ ([ 1 -1 -1 2 ]) } =(-3/1)=-3 $ $x=2$, $y=2$    Use Cramer's Rule to solve this system for $ z $. $ $ 2x + y + z = 1 3x + z = 4 x - y - z = 2 $ $  $ z=1 $   Prove Cramer's Rule.  Determinants are unchanged by combinations, including column combinations, so $ det(B_i)=det(vec(a)_1,..., x_1vec(a)_1+...+x_ivec(a)_i+...+x_nvec(a)_n,...,vec(a)_n) $. Use the operation of taking $-x_1$ times the first column and adding it to the $i$-th column, etc., to see this is equal to $det(vec(a)_1,...,x_ivec(a)_i,...,vec(a)_n)$. In turn, that is equal to $x_i·det(vec(a)_1,...,vec(a)_i,...,vec(a)_n) =x_i·det(A)$, as required.   Here is an alternative proof of Cramer's Rule that doesn't overtly contain any geometry. Write $X_i$ for the identity matrix with column~$i$ replaced by the vector~$vec(x)$ of unknowns $x_1$, ...,~$x_n$.  Observe that $AX_i=B_i$. Take the determinant of both sides.     Here is the case of a $N by N$ system with $i=2$. $ $ a_{1,1}x_1 + a_{1,2}x_2 = b_1 a_{2,1}x_1 + a_{2,2}x_2 = b_2 $ Longleftrightarrow ([ a_{1,1} a_{1,2} a_{2,1} a_{2,2} ]) ([ 1 x_1 0 x_2 ]) = ([ a_{1,1} b_1 a_{2,1} b_2 ]) $ The determinant function is multiplicative $det(B_i)=det(AX_i)=det(A)·det(X_i)$. The Laplace expansion shows that $det(X_i)=x_i$, and solving for $x_i$ gives Cramer's Rule.     Suppose that a linear system has as many equations as unknowns, that all of its coefficients and constants are integers, and that its matrix of coefficients has determinant~$ 1 $. Prove that the entries in the solution are all integers. (Remark. This is often used to invent linear systems for exercises.)  Because the determinant of $A$ is nonzero, Cramer's Rule applies and shows that $x_i=determinant(B_i)/1$. Since $B_i$ is a matrix of integers, its determinant is an integer.   Use Cramer's Rule to give a formula for the solution of a two equations/two unknowns linear system.  The solution of $ $ ax + by = e cx + dy = f $ $ is $ x=(ed-fb/ad-bc)  y=(af-ec/ad-bc) $ provided of course that the denominators are not zero.   Can Cramer's Rule tell the difference between a system with no solutions and one with infinitely many?  Of course, singular systems have $ determinant(A) $ equal to zero, but we can characterize the infinitely many solutions case is by the fact that all of the $ determinant(B_i) $ are zero as well.   The first picture in this Topic (the one that doesn't use determinants) shows a unique solution case. Produce a similar picture for the case of infinitely many solutions, and the case of no solutions.  We can consider the two nonsingular cases together with this system $ $ x_1 + 2x_2 = 6 x_1 + 2x_2 = c $ $ where $c=6$ of course yields infinitely many solutions, and any other value for $c$ yields no solutions. The corresponding vector equation $ x_1·[1 1]+x_2·[2 2]=[6 c] $ gives a picture of two overlapping vectors. Both lie on the line $y=x$. In the $c=6$ case the vector on the right side also lies on the line $y=x$ but in any other case it does not.           For large matrices, finding the determinant by using row operations is typically much faster than using the permutation expansion. We make this statement precise by finding how many operations each method performs.  To compare the speed of two algorithms, we find for each one how the time taken grows as the size of its input data set grows. For instance, if we increase the size of the input by a factor of ten does the time taken grow by a factor of ten, or by a factor of a hundred, or by a factor of a thousand? That is, is the time taken proportional to the size of the data set, or to the square of that size, or to the cube of that size, etc.? An algorithm whose time is proportional to the square is faster than one that takes time proportional to the cube.  First consider the permutation expansion formula.  $ ([ t_{1,1} t_{1,2} ... t_{1,n} t_{2,1} t_{2,2} ... t_{2,n} ... t_{n,1} t_{n,2} ... t_{n,n} ]) =∑_{permutations φ} t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}·s t_{n,φ(n)} deter{P_{φ}}             $ There are $n!=n·(n-1)·s 2· 1$ different $ n $-permutations so for a matrix with $n$~rows this sum has $n!$ terms (and inside each term is $n$-many multiplications). The factorial function grows quickly: when $n$ is only $10$ the expansion already has $10!=3,628,800$ terms. Observe that growth proportional to the factorial is bigger than growth proportional to the square $n!>n^2$ because multiplying the first two factors in $n!$ gives $n·(n-1)$, which for large $n$ is approximately $n^2$ and then multiplying in more factors will make the factorial even larger. Similarly, the factorial function grows faster than~$n^3$, etc. So an algorithm that uses the permutation expansion formula, and thus performs a number of operations at least as large as the factorial of the number of rows, would be very slow.  In contrast, the time taken by the row reduction method does not grow so fast.                  Below is a script for row reduction in the computer language Python. (Note: The code here is naive; for example it does not handle the case that the entry is zero. Analysis of a finished version that includes all of the tests and subcases is messier but would gives us roughly the same speed results.)  import random  def random_matrix(num_rows, num_cols): m = [] for col in range(num_cols): new_row = [] for row in range(num_rows): new_row.append(random.uniform(0,100)) m.append(new_row) return m  def gauss_method(m): """Perform Gauss's Method on m.

This program prompts a user for the number of rows, generates a random square matrix of that size, and does row reduction on it.  $ python gauss_method.py number of rows? 4 [69.48033741746909, 32.393754742132586, 91.35245787350696, 87.04557918402462] [98.64189032145111, 28.58228108715638, 72.32273998878178, 26.310252241189257] [85.22896214660841, 39.93894635139987, 4.061683241757219, 70.5925099861901] [24.06322759315518, 26.699175587284373, 37.398583921673314, 87.42617087562161] ----- [69.48033741746909, 32.393754742132586, 91.35245787350696, 87.04557918402462] [0.0, -17.40743803545155, -57.37120602662462, -97.2691774792963] [0.0, 0.0, -108.66513774392809, -37.31586824349682] [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -13.678536859817994]   Inside of the  routine, for each row , the routine performs $·ρ_{}+ρ_{}$ on the rows below. For each of these rows below, this involves operating on every entry in that row. That is a triply-nested loop. So this program has a running time that is something like the cube of the number of rows in the matrix. (Comment. We are glossing over many issues. For example, we may worry that the time taken by the program is dominated by the time to store and retrieve entries from memory, rather than by the row operations. However, development of a computation model is outside of our scope.)

Finding the fastest algorithm to compute the determinant is a topic of current research. So far, researchers have found algorithms that run in time between the square and cube of the number of rows.  The contrast between the times taken by the two determinant computation methods of permutation expansion and row operations makes the point that although in principle they give the same answer, in practice we want the one with the best performance.      To get an idea of what happens for typical matrices we can use the ability of computer systems to generate random numbers (of course, these are only pseudo-random in that they come from an algorithm but they pass a number of reasonable statistical tests for randomness).  Fill a $N by N$ array with random numbers say, in the range $clopinterval(0){1}$). See if it is singular. Repeat that experiment a few times. Are singular matrices frequent or rare in this sense? Time your computer algebra system at finding the determinant of ten $N by N$ arrays of random numbers. Find the average time per array. Repeat the prior item for $N by N$ arrays, $N by N$ arrays, ... $N by N$ arrays, and compare to the numbers given above. (Notice that, when an array is singular, we can sometimes decide that quickly, for instance if the first row equals the second. In the light of your answer to the first part, do you expect that singular systems play a large role in your average?) Graph the input size versus the average time.   Your timing will depend in part on the computer algebra system that you use, and in part on the power of the computer on which you do the calculation. But you should get a curve that is similar to the one shown.                                                                        Compute the determinant of each of these by hand using the two methods discussed above.  $([ 2 1 5 -3 ])$ $([ 3 1 1 -1 0 5 -1 2 -2 ])$ $([ 2 1 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 -1 -2 1 0 0 -2 1 ])$  Count the number of multiplications and divisions used in each case, for each of the methods.     The number of operations depends on exactly how we do the operations.  The determinant is $-11$. To row reduce takes a single row combination with two multiplications ($-5/2$ times $2$ plus $5$, and $-5/2$ times $1$ plus $-3$) and the product down the diagonal takes one more multiplication. The permutation expansion takes two multiplications ($2$ times $-3$ and $5$ times $1$). The determinant is $-39$. Counting the operations is routine. The determinant is $4$.   The use by the timing routine of has a bug. That routine does two things, generate a random matrix and then do on it, and the timing number returned is for the combination. Produce code that times only the routine.  You should build the matrix once and then time it being reduced many times. Note that , as written, changes the input matrix, so be careful not to loop using the output of that routine or all the loops but the first will be on an echelon form matrix.   What $N by N$ array can you invent that takes your computer the longest time to reduce? The shortest?  The identity matrix typically does not take long to reduce. For matrices that are slow, in Python you can try ones with numbers that are quite large. (Some computer algebra system also have the ability to generate special matrices; try some of those.)                            Some computer language specifications requires that arrays be stored ``by column,'' that is, the entire first column is stored contiguously, then the second column, etc. Does the code fragment given take advantage of this, or can it be rewritten to make it faster, by taking advantage of the fact that computer fetches are faster from contiguous locations?  No, the above code handles the numbers by row.            When doing Gauss's Method on a matrix that contains only integers people often like to keep it that way. To avoid fractions in the reduction of this matrix $ A= ([ 2 1 1 3 4 -1 1 5 1 ]) $ they may start by multiplying the lower rows by~$2$ $ for step $2ρ_2$ ([ 2 1 1 6 8 -2 2 10 2 ])  $ so that elimination in the first column goes like this. $ for step $-3ρ_1+ρ_2$ ([ 2 1 1 0 5 -5 0 8 0 ])  $ This all-integer approach is easier for mental calculations. And, using integer arithmetic on a computer avoids some sticky issues involving floating point calculations . So there are sound reasons for this approach.  Another advantage of this approach is that we can easily apply Laplace's expansion to the first column of~($**$) and then get the determinant by remembering to divide by $4$ because of~($*$).  Here is the general $N by N$ case of this approach to finding the determinant. First, assuming $a_{1,1} ≠ 0$, we can rescale the lower rows. $ A= ([ a_{1,1} a_{1,2} a_{1,3} a_{2,1} a_{2,2} a_{2,3} a_{3,1} a_{3,2} a_{3,3} ]) grstep[a_{1,1}ρ_3]{a_{1,1}ρ_2} ([ a_{1,1} a_{1,2} a_{1,3} a_{2,1}a_{1,1} a_{2,2}a_{1,1} a_{2,3}a_{1,1} a_{3,1}a_{1,1} a_{3,2}a_{1,1} a_{3,3}a_{1,1} ]) $ This rescales the determinant by $a_{1,1}^2$. Now eliminate down the first column. $ grstep[-a_{3,1}ρ_1+ρ_3]{-a_{2,1}ρ_1+ρ_2} ([ a_{1,1} a_{1,2} a_{1,3} 0 a_{2,2}a_{1,1}-a_{2,1}a_{1,2} a_{2,3}a_{1,1}-a_{2,1}a_{1,3} 0 a_{3,2}a_{1,1}-a_{3,1}a_{1,2} a_{3,3}a_{1,1}-a_{3,1}a_{1,3} ]) $ Let $C$ be the $1,1$ minor. By Laplace the determinant of the above matrix is $a_{1,1}det(C)$. We thus have $a_{1,1}^2det(A)=a_{1,1}det(C)$ and since $a_{1,1} ≠ 0$ this gives $det(A)=det(C)/a_{1,1}$.  To do larger matrices we must see how to compute the minor's entries. The pattern above is that each element of the minor is a $N by N$~determinant. For instance, the entry in the minor's upper left $a_{2,2}a_{1,1}-a_{2,1}a_{1,2}$, which is the $2,2$~entry in the above matrix, is the determinant of the matrix of these four elements of $A$. $ ([ highlight{$a_{1,1}$} highlight{$a_{1,2}$} a_{1,3} highlight{$a_{2,1}$} highlight{$a_{2,2}$} a_{2,3} a_{3,1} a_{3,2} a_{3,3} ]) $ And the minor's lower left, the $3,2$ entry from above, is the determinant of the matrix of these four. $ ([ highlight{$a_{1,1}$} highlight{$a_{1,2}$} a_{1,3} a_{2,1} a_{2,2} a_{2,3} highlight{$a_{3,1}$} highlight{$a_{3,2}$} a_{3,3} ]) $  So, where $A$ is~$N by N$ for $n≥ 3$, we let Chi\`o's matrix $C$ be the $N by (n-1)$ matrix whose $i,j$ entry is the determinant $ ([ a_{1,1} a_{1,j+1} a_{i+1,1} a_{i+1,j+1} ]) $ where $1<i,j≤ n$. Chi\`o's method for finding the determinant of $A$ is that if $a_{1,1} ≠ 0$ then $det(A)=det(C)/a_{1,1}^{n-2}$. (By the way, nothing in Chi\`o's formula requires that the numbers be integers; it applies to reals as well.)  To illustrate we find the determinant of this $N by N$ matrix. $ A= ([ 2 1 1 3 4 -1 1 5 1 ]) $ This is Chi\`o's matrix. $ C= ([ ([ 2 1 3 4 ])  ([ 2 1 3 -1 ]) [3ex] ([ 2 1 1 5 ])  ([ 2 1 1 1 ]) ]) = ([ 5 -5 9 1 ]) $ The formula for $N by N$ matrices $det(A)=det(C)/a_{1,1}$ gives $det(A)=(50/2)=25$.  For a larger determinant we must do multiple steps but each involves only $N by N$ determinants. So we can often calculate the determinant just by writing down a bit of intermediate information. For instance, with this $N by N$ matrix $ A= ([ 3 0 1 1 1 2 0 1 2 -1 0 3 1 0 0 1 ]) $ we can mentally doing each of the $N by N$ calculations and only write down the $N by N$ result. $ C_3= ([ ([ 3 0 1 2 ]) ([ 3 1 1 0 ]) ([ 3 1 1 1 ]) [3ex] ([ 3 0 2 -1 ]) ([ 3 1 2 0 ]) ([ 3 1 2 3 ]) [3ex] ([ 3 0 1 0 ]) ([ 3 1 1 0 ]) ([ 3 1 1 1 ]) ]) = ([ 6 -1 2 -3 -2 7 0 -1 2 ]) $ Note that the determinant of this is $a_{1,1}^{4-2}=3^2$ times the determinant of~$A$.  To finish, iterate. Here is Chi\`o's matrix of $C_3$. $ C_2= ([ ([ 6 -1 -3 -2 ]) ([ 6 2 -3 7 ]) [3ex] ([ 6 -1 0 -1 ]) ([ 6 2 0 2 ]) ]) = ([ -15 48 -6 12 ]) $ The determinant of this matrix is $6$~times the determinant of~$C_3$. The determinant of $C_2$ is $108$. So $det(A)=108/(3^2· 6)=2$.  Laplace's expansion formula reduces the calculation of an~$N by N$ determinant to the evaluation of a number of $N by (n-1)$~ones. Chi\`o's formula is also recursive but it reduces an~$N by N$ determinant to a single~$N by (n-1)$ determinant, calculated from a number of $N by N$ determinants. However, for large matrices Gauss's Method is better than either of these; for instance, it takes roughly half as many operations as Chi\`o's Method~.     Use Chi\`o's Method to find each determinant.   $ ([ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]) $  $ ([ 2 1 4 0 0 1 4 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 1 1 ]) $    Chi\`o's matrix is $ C= ([ -3 -6 -6 -12 ]) $ and its determinant is $0$ Start with $ C_3= ([ 2 8 0 1 -2 2 4 2 2 ]) $ and then the next step $ C_2= ([ -12 4 -28 4 ]) $ with determinant $det(C_2)=64$. The determinant of the original matrix is thus $64/(2^2· 2^1)=8$   What if $a_{1,1}$ is zero?  The same construction as was used for the $N by N$~case above shows that in place of $a_{1,1}$ we can select any nonzero entry~$a_{i,j}$. Entry $c_{p,q}$ of Chi\`o's matrix is the value of this determinant $ ([ a_{1,1} a_{1,q+1} a_{p+1,1} a_{p+1,q+1} ]) $ where $p+1 ≠ i$ and $q+1 ≠ j$.  The Rule of Sarrus is a mnemonic that many people learn for the $N by N$ determinant formula. To the right of the matrix, copy the first two columns. $ $ a b c a b d e f d e g h i g h $ $ Then the determinant is the sum of the three upper-left to lower-right diagonals minus the three lower-left to upper-right diagonals $aei+bfg+cdh-gec-hfa-idb$. Count the operations involved in Sarrus's formula and in Chi\`o's.  Sarrus's formula uses $12$~multiplications and $5$ additions (including the subtractions in with the additions). Chi\`o's formula uses two multiplications and an addition (which is actually a subtraction) for each of the four $N by N$~determinants, and another two multiplications and an addition for the $N by N$~Chi\'o's determinant, as well as a final division by $a_{1,1}$. That's eleven multiplication/divisions and five addition/subtractions. So Chi\`o is the winner.  Prove Chi\`o's formula.  Consider an $N by N$ matrix. $ A= ([ a_{1,1} a_{1,2} ·s a_{1,n-1} a_{1,n} a_{2,1} a_{2,2} ·s a_{2,n-1} a_{2,n} ... a_{n-1,1} a_{n-1,2} ·s a_{n-1,n-1} a_{n-1,n} a_{n,1} a_{n,2} ·s a_{n,n-1} a_{n,n} ]) $ Rescale every row but the first by~$a_{1,1}$. $ grstep[a_{1,1}ρ_3 ... a_{1,1}ρ_{n}]{a_{1,1}ρ_2} ([ a_{1,1} a_{1,2} ·s a_{1,n-1} a_{1,n} a_{2,1}a_{1,1} a_{2,2}a_{1,1} ·s a_{2,n-1}a_{1,1} a_{2,n}a_{1,1} ... a_{n-1,1}a_{1,1} a_{n-1,2}a_{1,1} ·s a_{n-1,n-1}a_{1,1} a_{n-1,n}a_{1,1} a_{n,1}a_{1,1} a_{n,2}a_{1,1} ·s a_{n,n-1}a_{1,1} a_{n,n}a_{1,1} ]) $ That rescales the determinant by a factor of~$a_{1,1}^{n-1}$.  Next perform the row operation $-a_{i,1}ρ_1+ρ_i$ on each row~$i>1$. These row operations don't change the determinant. $ grstep[-a_{3,1}ρ_1+ρ_3 ...ρ_1+ρ_3} -a_{n,1}ρ_1+ρ_n]{-a_{2,1}ρ_1+ρ_2} $ The result is a matrix whose first row is unchanged, whose first column is all zero's (except for the $1,1$ entry of $a_{1,1}$), and whose remaining entries are these. $ ([ a_{1,2} ·s a_{1,n-1} a_{1,n}  a_{2,2}a_{1,1}-a_{2,1}a_{1,2} ·s a_{2,n-1}a_{n,n}-a_{2,n-1}a_{1,n-1} a_{2,n}a_{n,n}-a_{2,n}a_{1,n}  ... a_{n,2}a_{1,1}-a_{n,1}a_{1,2} ·s a_{n,n-1}a_{1,1}-a_{n,1}a_{1,n-1} a_{n,n}a_{1,1}-a_{n,1}a_{1,n} ]) $ The determinant of this matrix is $a_{1,1}^{n-1}$~times the determinant of~$A$.  Denote by~$C$ the $1,1$ minor of the matrix, that is, the submatrix consisting of the first $n-1$ rows and columns. The Laplace expansion down the final column of the above matrix gives that its determinant is $(-1)^{1+1}a_{1,1}det(C)$.  If $a_{1,1} ≠ 0$ then setting the two equal and canceling gives $det(A)=det(C)/a_{n,n}^{n-2}$.     This implements Chi\`o's Method.

One such geometry arose when artists observed that what a viewer sees is not necessarily what is there. As an example, here is Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.   includegraphics[width=.6textwidth]{LastSupper.jpg}  Look at where the ceiling meets the left and right walls. In the room those lines are parallel but da~Vinci has painted lines that, if extended, would intersect. The intersection is the vanishing point. This aspect of perspective is familiar as an image of railroad tracks that appear to converge at the horizon.  Da~Vinci has adopted a model of how we see.   Imagine a person viewing a room. From the person's eye, in every direction, carry a ray outward until it intersects something, such as a point on the line where the wall meets the ceiling. This first intersection point is what the person sees in that direction. Overall what the person sees is the collection of three-dimensional intersection points projected to a common two dimensional image.  includegraphics[scale=.8]{ch4.5}  This is a central projection from a single point. As the sketch shows, this projection is not orthogonal like the ones we have seen earlier because the line from the viewer to~$C$ is not orthogonal to the image plane. (This model is only an approximation- it does not take into account such factors as that we have binocular vision or that our brain's processing greatly affects what we perceive. Nonetheless the model is interesting, both artistically and mathematically.)  The operation of central projection preserves some geometric properties, for instance lines project to lines. However, it fails to preserve some others. One example is that equal length segments can project to segments of unequal length (above, $AB$ is longer than $BC$ because the segment projected to $AB$ is closer to the viewer and closer things look bigger). The study of the effects of central projections is projective geometry.  There are three cases of central projection. The first is the projection done by a movie projector.    We can think that each source point is pushed from the domain plane~$S$ outward to the image plane~$I$. The second case of projection is that of the artist pulling the source back to a canvas.    The two are different because first $S$ is in the middle and then $I$. One more configuration can happen, with $P$ in the middle. An example of this is when we use a pinhole to shine the image of a solar eclipse onto a paper.     Although the three are not exactly the same, they are similar. We shall say that each is a central projection by $P$ of $S$ to $I$. We next look at three models of central projection, of increasing abstractness but also of increasing uniformity. The last model will bring out the linear algebra.   Consider again the effect of railroad tracks that appear to converge to a point. Model this with parallel lines in a domain plane~$S$ and a projection via a $P$ to a codomain plane~$I$. (The gray lines shown are parallel to the $S$ plane and to the~$I$ plane.)    This single setting shows all three projection cases. The first picture below shows $P$ acting as a movie projector by pushing points from part of $S$ out to image points on the lower half of $I$. The middle picture shows $P$ acting as the artist by pulling points from another part of $S$ back to image points in the middle of $I$. In the third picture $P$ acts as the pinhole, projecting points from $S$ to the upper part of $I$. This third picture is the trickiest- the points that are projected near to the vanishing point are the ones that are far out on the lower left of $S$. Points in $S$ that are near to the vertical gray line are sent high up on $I$.         There are two awkward things here. First, neither of the two points in the domain nearest to the vertical gray line (see below) has an image because a projection from those two is along the gray line that is parallel to the codomain plane (we say that these two are projected to infinity). The second is that the vanishing point in $I$ isn't the image of any point from $S$ because a projection to this point would be along the gray line that is parallel to the domain plane (we say that the vanishing point is the image of a projection from infinity).     For a model that eliminates this awkwardness, cover the projector $P$ with a hemispheric dome. In any direction, defined by a line through the origin, project anything in that direction to the single spot on the dome where the line intersects. This includes projecting things on the line between $P$ and the dome, as with the movie projector. It includes projecting things on the line further from $P$ than the dome, as with the painter. More subtly, it also includes things on the line that lie behind $P$, as with the pinhole case.    More formally, for any nonzero vector $vec(v) in ℝ^3$, let the associated point $v$ in the projective plane be the set ${kvec{{v} such that {$k in ℝ$ and $k ≠ 0$}$ of nonzero vectors lying on the same line through the origin as $vec(v)$. To describe a projective point we can give any representative member of the line, so that the projective point shown above can be represented in any of these three ways. $ [1 2 3]  [1/3 2/3 1]  [-2 -4 -6] $ Each of these is a homogeneous coordinate vector  for the point~$l$.  This picture and definition clarifies central projection but there is still something ungainly about the dome model:~what happens when $P$ looks down? Consider, in the sketch above, the part of $P$'s line of sight that comes up towards us, out of the page. Imagine that this part of the line falls, to the equator and below. Now the part of the line~$l$ that intersects the dome lies behind the page.  That is, as the line of sight continues down past the equator, the projective point suddenly shifts from the front of the dome to the back of the dome. (This brings out that the dome does not include the entire equator or else when the viewer is looking exactly along the equator then there would be two points in the line that are both on the dome. Instead we define the dome so that it includes the points on the equator with a positive~$y$ coordinate, as well as the point where $y=0$ and $x$ is positive.) This discontinuity means that we often have to treat equatorial points as a separate case. So while the railroad track model of central projection has three cases, the dome has two.  We can do better, we can reduce to a model having a single case. Consider a sphere centered at the origin. Any line through the origin intersects the sphere in two spots, said to be antipodal. Because we associate each line through the origin with a point in the projective plane, we can draw such a point as a pair of antipodal spots on the sphere. Below, we show the two antipodal spots connected by a dashed line to emphasize that they are not two different points, the pair of spots together make one projective point.    While drawing a point as a pair of antipodal spots on the sphere is not as intuitive as the one-spot-per-point dome mode, on the other hand the awkwardness of the dome model is gone in that as a line of view slides from north to south, no sudden changes happen. This central projection model is uniform.  So far we have described points in projective geometry. What about lines? What a viewer~$P$ at the origin sees as a line is shown below as a great circle, the intersection of the model sphere with a plane through the origin.    (We've included one of the projective points on this line to bring out a subtlety. Because two antipodal spots together make up a single projective point, the great circle's behind-the-paper part is the same set of projective points as its in-front-of-the-paper part.) Just as we did with each projective point, we can also describe a projective line with a triple of reals. For instance, the members of this plane through the origin in $ ℝ^3$ $  {[x y z] such that x+y-z=0} $ project to a line that we can describe with $[1 1 -1]$ (using a row vector for this typographically distinguishes lines from points). In general, for any nonzero three-wide row vector $smash{vec(L)}$ we define the associated line in the projective plane,  to be the set $L={kvec{{L} such that {$k in ℝ$ and $k ≠ 0$}$.  The reason this description of a line as a triple is convenient is that in the projective plane a point $v$ and a line $L$ are incident - the point lies on the line, the line passes through the point - if and only if a dot product of their representatives $v_1L_1+v_2L_2+v_3L_3$ is zero ( shows that this is independent of the choice of representatives $smash{vec(v)}$ and $smash{vec(L)}$). For instance, the projective point described above by the column vector with components $1$, $2$, and $3$ lies in the projective line described by $[1 1 -1]$, simply because any vector in $ ℝ^3$ whose components are in ratio $1 :2 :3$ lies in the plane through the origin whose equation is of the form $k· x+k· y-k· z=0$ for any nonzero~$k$. That is, the incidence formula is inherited from the three-space lines and planes of which $v$ and $L$ are projections.  With this, we can do analytic projective geometry. For instance, the projective line $L=[1 1 -1]$ has the equation $1v_1+1v_2-1v_3=0$, meaning that for any projective point~$v$ incident with the line, any of $v$'s representative homogeneous coordinate vectors will satisfy the equation. This is true simply because those vectors lie on the three space plane. One difference from Euclidean analytic geometry is that in projective geometry besides talking about the equation of a line, we also talk about the equation of a point. For the fixed point $ v=[1 2 3] $ the property that characterizes lines incident on this point is that the components of any representatives satisfy $1L_1+2L_2+3L_3=0$ and so this is the equation of $v$.  This symmetry of the statements about lines and points is the Duality Principle of projective geometry:~in any true statement, interchanging `point' with `line' results in another true statement. For example, just as two distinct points determine one and only one line, in the projective plane two distinct lines determine one and only one point. Here is a picture showing two projective lines that cross in antipodal spots and thus cross at one projective point.      Contrast this with Euclidean geometry, where two unequal lines may have a unique intersection or may be parallel. In this way, projective geometry is simpler, more uniform, than Euclidean geometry.  That simplicity is relevant because there is a relationship between the two spaces:~we can view the projective plane as an extension of the Euclidean plane. Draw the sphere model of the projective plane as the unit sphere in $ ℝ^3$. Take Euclidean $2$-space to be the plane $z=1$. As shown below, all of the points on the Euclidean plane are projections of antipodal spots from the sphere. Conversely, we can view some points in the projective plane as corresponding to points in Euclidean space. (Note that projective points on the equator don't correspond to points on the plane; instead we say these project out to infinity.)      Thus we can think of projective space as consisting of the Euclidean plane with some extra points adjoined - the Euclidean plane is embedded in the projective plane. The extra points in projective space, the equatorial points, are called ideal points  or points at infinity and the equator is called the ideal line or line at infinity (it is not a Euclidean line, it is a projective line).  The advantage of this extension from the Euclidean plane to the projective plane is that some of the nonuniformity of Euclidean geometry disappears. For instance, the projective lines shown above in~($*$) cross at antipodal spots, a single projective point, on the sphere's equator. If we put those lines into~($**$) then they correspond to Euclidean lines that are parallel. That is, in moving from the Euclidean plane to the projective plane, we move from having two cases, that distinct lines either intersect or are parallel, to having only one case, that distinct lines intersect (possibly at a point at infinity).  A disadvantage of the projective plane is that we don't have the same familiarity with it as we have with the Euclidean plane. Doing analytic geometry in the projective plane helps because the equations lead us to the right conclusions. Analytic projective geometry uses linear algebra. For instance, for three points of the projective plane $t$, $u$, and~$v$, setting up the equations for those points by fixing vectors representing each shows that the three are collinear if and only if the resulting three-equation system has infinitely many row vector solutions representing their line. That in turn holds if and only if this determinant is zero. $ ([ t_1 u_1 v_1 t_2 u_2 v_2 t_3 u_3 v_3 ]) $ Thus, three points in the projective plane are collinear if and only if any three representative column vectors are linearly dependent. Similarly, by duality, three lines in the projective plane are incident on a single point if and only if any three row vectors representing them are linearly dependent.  The following result is more evidence of the niceness of the geometry of the projective plane. These two triangles are in perspective from the point $O$ because their corresponding vertices are collinear.    Consider the pairs of corresponding sides: the sides $T_1U_1$ and $T_2U_2$, the sides $T_1V_1$ and $T_2V_2$, and the sides $U_1V_1$ and $U_2V_2$. Desargue's Theorem is that when we extend the three pairs of corresponding sides, they intersect (shown here as the points $TU$, $TV$, and $UV$). What's more, those three intersection points are collinear.    We will prove this using projective geometry. (We've drawn Euclidean figures because that is the more familiar image. To consider them as projective figures we can imagine that, although the line segments shown are parts of great circles and so are curved, the model has such a large radius compared to the size of the figures that the sides appear in our sketch to be straight.)  For the proof we need a preliminary lemma :~if $W$, $X$, $Y$, $Z$ are four points in the projective plane, no three of which are collinear, then there are homogeneous coordinate vectors $vec(w)$, $vec(x)$, $vec(y)$, and $vec(z)$ for the projective points, and a basis $B$ for $ ℝ^3$, satisfying this. $ rep{vec(w)}{B}=[1 0 0]  rep{vec(x)}{B}=[0 1 0]  rep{vec(y)}{B}=[0 0 1]  rep{vec(z)}{B}=[1 1 1] $ To prove the lemma, because $W$, $X$, and $Y$ are not on the same projective line, any homogeneous coordinate vectors $vec(w)_0$, $vec(x)_0$, and $vec(y)_0$ do not line on the same plane through the origin in $ ℝ^3$ and so form a spanning set for $ ℝ^3$. Thus any homogeneous coordinate vector for $Z$ is a combination $vec(z)_0=a·vec(w)_0+b·vec(x)_0+c·vec(y)_0$. Then let the basis be $B=sequence{vec(w),vec(x),vec(y)}$ and take $vec(w)=a·vec(w)_0$, $vec(x)=b·vec(x)_0$, $vec(y)=c·vec(y)_0$, and $vec(z)=vec(z)_0$.  To prove Desargue's Theorem use the lemma to fix homogeneous coordinate vectors and a basis. $ rep{vec(t)_1}{B}=[1 0 0]  rep{vec(u)_1}{B}=[0 1 0]  rep{vec(v)_1}{B}=[0 0 1]  rep{vec(o)}{B}=[1 1 1] $ The projective point $T_2$ is incident on the projective line $OT_1$ so any homogeneous coordinate vector for $T_2$ lies in the plane through the origin in $ ℝ^3$ that is spanned by homogeneous coordinate vectors of $O$ and $T_1$: $ rep{vec(t)_2}{B}=a[1 1 1] +b[1 0 0] $ for some scalars $a$ and $b$. Hence the homogeneous coordinate vectors of members $T_2$ of the line $OT_1$ are of the form on the left below. The forms for $U_2$ and $V_2$ are similar. $ rep{vec(t)_2}{B}=[t_2 1 1]  rep{vec(u)_2}{B}=[1 u_2 1]  rep{vec(v)_2}{B}=[1 1 v_2] $ The projective line $T_1U_1$ is the projection of a plane through the origin in $ ℝ^3$. One way to get its equation is to note that any vector in it is linearly dependent on the vectors for $T_1$ and $U_1$ and so this determinant is zero. $ ([ 1 0 x 0 1 y 0 0 z ])=0  -->  z=0 $ The equation of the plane in $ ℝ^3$ whose image is the projective line $T_2U_2$ is this. $ ([ t_2 1 x 1 u_2 y 1 1 z ])=0  -->  (1-u_2)· x+(1-t_2)· y+(t_2u_2-1)· z=0 $ Finding the intersection of the two is routine. $ T_1U_1 intersection T_2U_2 =[t_2-1 1-u_2 0] $ (This is, of course, a homogeneous coordinate vector of a projective point.) The other two intersections are similar. $ T_1V_1 intersection T_2V_2 =[1-t_2 0 v_2-1]  U_1V_1 intersection U_2V_2 =[0 u_2-1 1-v_2] $ Finish the proof by noting that these projective points are on one projective line because the sum of the three homogeneous coordinate vectors is zero.  Every projective theorem has a translation to a Euclidean version, although the Euclidean result may be messier to state and prove. Desargue's theorem illustrates this. In the translation to Euclidean space, we must treat separately the case where $O$ lies on the ideal line, for then the lines $T_1T_2$, $U_1U_2$, and $V_1V_2$ are parallel.  The remark following the statement of Desargue's Theorem suggests thinking of the Euclidean pictures as figures from projective geometry for a sphere model with very large radius. That is, just as a small area of the world seems to people living there to be flat, the projective plane is locally Euclidean.  We finish by pointing out one more thing about the projective plane. Although its local properties are familiar, the projective plane has a perhaps unfamiliar global property. The picture below shows a projective point. At that point we have drawn Cartesian axes, $xy$-axes. Of course, the axes appear in the picture at both antipodal spots, one in the northern hemisphere (that is, shown on the right) and the other in the south. Observe that in the northern hemisphere a person who puts their right hand on the sphere, palm down, with their thumb on the $y$~axis will have their fingers pointing along the $x$-axis in the positive direction.              The sequence of pictures below show a trip around this space: the antipodal spots rotate around the sphere with the spot in the northern hemisphere moving up and over the north pole, ending on the far side of the sphere, and its companion coming to the front. (Be careful:~the trip shown is not halfway around the projective plane. It is a full circuit. The spots at either end of the dashed line are the same projective point. So by the third sphere below the trip has pretty much returned to the same projective point where we drew it starting above.)   $-->$  $-->$   At the end of the circuit, the $x$~part of the $xy$-axes sticks out in the other direction. That is, for a person to put their thumb on the $y$-axis and have their fingers point positively on the $x$-axis, they must use their left hand. The projective plane is not orientable- in this geometry, left and right handedness are not fixed properties of figures (said another way, we cannot describe a spiral as clockwise or counterclockwise).  This exhibition of the existence of a non-orientable space raises the question of whether our universe orientable. Could an astronaut leave earth right-handed and return left-handed? is a nontechnical reference. is a classic science fiction story about orientation reversal.  For an overview of projective geometry see . The approach we've taken here, the analytic approach, leads to quick theorems and illustrates the power of linear algebra; see , , and . But another approach, the synthetic approach of deriving the results from an axiom system, is both extraordinarily beautiful and is also the historical route of development. Two fine sources for this approach are or . An easy and interesting application is in .    What is the equation of this point? $ [1 0 0] $  From the dot product $ 0=[1 0 0]dot product of [L_1 L_2 L_3] =L_1 $ we get that the equation is $L_1=0$.    Find the line incident on these points in the projective plane. $ [1 2 3],[4 5 6] $ Find the point incident on both of these projective lines. $ [1 2 3],[4 5 6] $    This determinant $ 0=([ 1 4 x 2 5 y 3 6 z ]) =-3x+6y-3z $ shows that the line is $L=[-3 6 -3]$. $[-3 6 -3]$    Find the formula for the line incident on two projective points. Find the formula for the point incident on two projective lines.  The line incident on $ u=[u_1 u_2 u_3]  v=[v_1 v_2 v_3] $ comes from this determinant equation. $ 0=([ u_1 v_1 x u_2 v_2 y u_3 v_3 z ]) =(u_2v_3-u_3v_2)· x + (u_3v_1-u_1v_3)· y + (u_1v_2-u_2v_1)· z $ The equation for the point incident on two lines is the same.   Prove that the definition of incidence is independent of the choice of the representatives of $p$ and $L$. That is, if $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, and $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ are two triples of homogeneous coordinates for $p$, and $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$, and $M_1$, $M_2$, $M_3$ are two triples of homogeneous coordinates for $L$, prove that $p_1L_1+p_2L_2+p_3L_3=0$ if and only if $q_1M_1+q_2M_2+q_3M_3=0$.  If $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, and $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ are two triples of homogeneous coordinates for $p$ then the two column vectors are in proportion, that is, lie on the same line through the origin. Similarly, the two row vectors are in proportion. $ k·[p_1 p_2 p_3] =[q_1 q_2 q_3]  m·[L_1 L_2 L_3] =[M_1 M_2 M_3] $ Then multiplying gives the answer $(km)· (p_1L_1+p_2L_2+p_3L_3)=q_1M_1+q_2M_2+q_3M_3=0$.   Give a drawing to show that central projection does not preserve circles, that a circle may project to an ellipse. Can a (non-circular) ellipse project to a circle?    The picture of the solar eclipse - unless the image plane is exactly perpendicular to the line from the sun through the pinhole - shows the circle of the sun projecting to an image that is an ellipse. (Another example is that in many pictures in this Topic, we've shown the circle that is the sphere's equator as an ellipse, that is, a viewer of the drawing sees a circle as an ellipse.)  The solar eclipse picture also shows the converse. If we picture the projection as going from left to right through the pinhole then the ellipse $I$ projects through $P$ to a circle~$S$.   Give the formula for the correspondence between the non-equatorial part of the antipodal modal of the projective plane, and the plane $z=1$.  A spot on the unit sphere $ [p_1 p_2 p_3] $ is non-equatorial if and only if $p_3 ≠ 0$. In that case it corresponds to this point on the $z=1$ plane $ [p_1/p_3 p_2/p_3 1] $ since that is intersection of the line containing the vector and the plane.                (Pappus's Theorem) Assume that $T_0$, $U_0$, and $V_0$ are collinear and that $T_1$, $U_1$, and $V_1$ are collinear. Consider these three points: (i)~the intersection $V_2$ of the lines $T_0U_1$ and $T_1U_0$, (ii)~the intersection $U_2$ of the lines $T_0V_1$ and $T_1V_0$, and (iii)~the intersection $T_2$ of $U_0V_1$ and $U_1V_0$.  Draw a (Euclidean) picture. Apply the lemma used in Desargue's Theorem to get simple homogeneous coordinate vectors for the $T$'s and $V_0$. Find the resulting homogeneous coordinate vectors for $U$'s (these must each involve a parameter as, e.g., $U_0$ could be anywhere on the $T_0V_0$ line). Find the resulting homogeneous coordinate vectors for $V_1$. (Hint:~it involves two parameters.) Find the resulting homogeneous coordinate vectors for $V_2$. (It also involves two parameters.) Show that the product of the three parameters is $1$. Verify that $V_2$ is on the $T_2U_2$ line.    Other pictures are possible, but this is one.    The intersections $ T_0U_1 intersection T_1U_0=V_2 $, $ T_0V_1 intersection T_1V_0=U_2 $, and $ U_0V_1 intersection U_1V_0=T_2 $ are labeled so that on each line is a $T$, a $U$, and a $V$. The lemma used in Desargue's Theorem gives a basis $B$ with respect to which the points have these homogeneous coordinate vectors. $ rep{vec(t)_0}{B}=[1 0 0]  rep{vec(t)_1}{B}=[0 1 0]  rep{vec(t)_2}{B}=[0 0 1]  rep{vec(v)_0}{B}=[1 1 1] $  First, any $U_0$ on $T_0V_0$ $ rep{vec(u)_0}{B}=a[1 0 0] +b[1 1 1] =[a+b b b] $ has homogeneous coordinate vectors of this form $ [u_0 1 1] $ ($u_0$ is a parameter; it depends on where on the $T_0V_0$ line the point $U_0$ is, but any point on that line has a homogeneous coordinate vector of this form for some $u_0 in ℝ$). Similarly, $U_2$ is on $T_1V_0$ $ rep{vec(u)_2}{B}=c[0 1 0] +d[1 1 1] =[d c+d d] $ and so has this homogeneous coordinate vector. $ [1 u_2 1] $ Also similarly, $U_1$ is incident on $T_2V_0$ $ rep{vec(u)_1}{B}=e[0 0 1] +f[1 1 1] =[f f e+f] $ and has this homogeneous coordinate vector. $ [1 1 u_1] $  Because $V_1$ is $T_0U_2 intersectionU_0T_2$ we have this. $ g[1 0 0]+h[1 u_2 1] =i[u_0 1 1]+j[0 0 1] --> $ g+h = iu_0 hu_2 = i h = i+j $ $ Substituting $hu_2$ for $i$ in the first equation $ [hu_0u_2 hu_2 h] $ shows that $V_1$ has this two-parameter homogeneous coordinate vector. $ [u_0u_2 u_2 1] $  Since $V_2$ is the intersection $T_0U_1 intersectionT_1U_0$ $ k[1 0 0]+l[1 1 u_1] =m[0 1 0]+n[u_0 1 1] --> $ k+l = nu_0 l = m+n lu_1 = n $ $ and substituting $lu_1$ for $n$ in the first equation $ [lu_0u_1 l lu_1] $ gives that $V_2$ has this two-parameter homogeneous coordinate vector. $ [u_0u_1 1 u_1] $  Because $V_1$ is on the $T_1U_1$ line its homogeneous coordinate vector has the form $ p[0 1 0]+q[1 1 u_1] =[q p+q qu_1] $ but a previous part of this question established that $V_1$'s homogeneous coordinate vectors have the form $ [u_0u_2 u_2 1] $ and so this a homogeneous coordinate vector for $V_1$. $ [u_0u_1u_2 u_1u_2 u_1] $ By ($*$) and ($**$), there is a relationship among the three parameters:~$u_0u_1u_2=1$.  The homogeneous coordinate vector of $V_2$ can be written in this way. $ [u_0u_1u_2 u_2 u_1u_2] =[1 u_2 u_1u_2] $ Now, the $T_2U_2$ line consists of the points whose homogeneous coordinates have this form. $ r[0 0 1]+s[1 u_2 1] =[s su_2 r+s] $ Taking $s=1$ and $r=u_1u_2-1$ shows that the homogeneous coordinate vectors of $V_2$ have this form.                The prior topic on Projective Geometry gives this model of how our eye, or a camera, sees the world.    All of the points on a line through the origin project to the same spot.  In that topic we defined that for any nonzero vector $vec(v) in ℝ^3$, the associated point $p$ in the projective plane is the set ${kvec{{v} such that {$k in ℝ$ and $k ≠ 0$}$. This is the collection of nonzero vectors lying on the same line through the origin as $vec(v)$.  To describe a projective point we can give any representative member of the line. Thus these each represent the same projective point. $ [1 2 3]  [1/3 2/3 1]  [-2 -4 -6] $ Each is a homogeneous coordinate vector  for the point~$p$. Two homogeneous coordinate vectors (which are by definition nonzero) $ tilde(p)_1=[a_1 b_1 c_1]  tilde(p)_2=[a_2 b_2 c_2] $ represent the same projective point if there is a scaling factor $s ≠ 0$ so that $stilde(p)_1=tilde(p)_2$.  Of the infinitely many possible representatives, often we use the one whose third component is~$1$. This amounts to projecting onto the plane $z=1$.     In this topic we will show how to use these ideas to perform some effects from computer graphics. For that we will take the prior picture and redraw it without the sphere, with a movie projector at the origin, and with plane $z=1$ looking like a movie theater screen.    This associates vectors in three-space on the grey line with $p$~in the screen plane. $ tilde(p)=[a b c] ↦ p=[x y]=[a/c b/c] $  We can adapt the things we have already seen about matrices to perform the transformations. Rotation is an example. This matrix rotates in the plane~$z=1$ about the origin by the angle~$θ$. $ ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) 0 sin(θ) cos(θ) 0 0 0 1 ]) [x y 1] = colvec{cosθ· x -sin(θ)· y sin(θ)· x +cos(θ)· y 1} $ Notice that it works on any homogeneous coordinate vector; if we apply the matrix $ ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) 0 sin(θ) cos(θ) 0 0 0 1 ]) [a b c] = colvec{cosθ· a -sin(θ)· b sin(θ)· a +cos(θ)· b c} $ and then move to the $z=1$~plane $ colvec{cosθ· a -sin(θ)· b sin(θ)· a +cos(θ)· b c} ↦ colvec{(cosθ· a -sin(θ)· b)/c (sin(θ)· a +cos(θ)· b)/c 1} $ then we get the same result as if we had first moved to the plane and then applied the matrix. $ ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) 0 sin(θ) cos(θ) 0 0 0 1 ]) [a/c b/c 1] = colvec{cosθ· a/c -sin(θ)· b/c sin(θ)· a/c +cos(θ)· b/c 1} $  So there is no harm in working with homogeneous coordinates. But what is the advantage?  The computer graphic operation of translation, of sliding things from one place to another, is not a linear transformation because it does not leave the origin fixed. But if we work with homogeneous coordinates then we can use matrices. This matrix will translate points in the plane of interest by $t_x$ in the $x$~direction and $t_y$ in the $y$~direction. $ ([ 1 0 t_x 0 1 t_y 0 0 1 ]) [a b c] = colvec{a+t_x· c b+t_y· c c} ↦ colvec{a/c+t_x b/c+t_y 1} $ That is, in the plane of interest this matrix slides $(a/c choose b/c)$ to $(a/c+t_x choose b/c+t_y)$. So the homogeneous coordinates allow us to use matrices.  OK then, but what is the advantages of using these matrices? What does the extra coordinate get us? Suppose that we are making a movie with computer graphics. We are at a moment where the camera is panning and rotating at the same time. Every single point in the scene needs to be both translated and rotated. Rather than have the computer perform two operations to each point, we can multiply the two matrices and then the computer only applies one operation to each point; it multiplies that point by the resulting matrix. That is a tremendous speedup and simplification.  We will list some examples of the effects that we can get. We have already talked about rotation. Here is the picture of rotation by a half radian.   $↦$   And here is a translation with $t_x=1.5$ and~$t_y=0.5$.   $↦$    Next is scaling. This matrix rescales things in the target plane by a factor of~$s$ in the $x$-direction, and by a factor of~$t$ in the $y$~direction. $ ([ s 0 0 0 t 0 0 0 1 ]) [a/c b/c 1] = colvec{s· a/c t· b/c 1} $ In this picture we rescale in the $x$~direction by a factor of $s=2.5$ and in the $y$-direction by~$t=0.75$.   $↦$    If we take $s=t$ then the entire shape is rescaled. For instance, if we string together frames with $s=t=1.10$ then in the movie it will seem that the object is getting closer to us.           We can reflect the object. This reflects about the line $y=x$. $ ([ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) [a/c b/c 1] = colvec{b/c a/c 1} $ The dashed line here is $y=x$.   $↦$    This reflects about $y=-x$. $ ([ 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) [a/c b/c 1] = colvec{-b/c -a/c 1} $ The dashed line below is $y=-x$.   $↦$    More complex transformations are possible. This is a shear. $ ([ 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) [a/c b/c 1] = colvec{a/c+b/c b/c 1} $ In this picture the $y$~components of points are unchanged, but the $x$~components have added to them the value of~$y$.   $↦$    A major advantage of having this all be matrices is that we can do complex things by combining simple things. To reflect about the line $y=-x+2$ we can find the three matrices to slide everything to the origin, then reflect about $y=-x$, and then slide back. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 ]) ([ 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 -2 0 0 1 ])  $ (As always, the action done first is described by the matrix on the right. That is, the matrix on the right describes sliding all points in the plane of interest by $-2$, the matrix in the middle reflects about $y=-x$, and the matrix on the left slides all points back.)  There are even more complex effects possible with matrices. These are the matrices for the general affine transformation, and the general projective transformation. $ ([ d e f g h i 0 0 1 ])  ([ d e f g h i j k 1 ]) $ However, description of their geometric effect is beyond our scope.  There is a vast literature on computer graphics, in which linear algebra plays an important part. An excellent source is . The subject is a wonderful blend of mathematics and art; see .       Calculate the product in ($*$).  Straightforward calculation gives this for the product. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 ]) ([ 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 -2 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 0 -1 2 -1 0 2 0 0 1 ]) $              Find the matrix that reflects about the line $y=2x$.  Working in $R$, let the matrix be $M$. We get these two. $ [1 2]↦ [1 2]  [-2 1]↦ [2 -1] $ (For the second one, the starting vector is on the line through the origin that is perpendicular to $y=2x$.) We have this. $ M ([ 1 -2 2 1 ]) = ([ 1 2 2 -1 ]) $ Solving gives $ M = ([ 1 2 2 -1 ]) ([ 1 -2 2 1 ])^{-1} = ([ -3/5 4/5 4/5 3/5 ]) $ and so for homogeneous coordinates the matrix is this. $ ([ -3/5 4/5 0 4/5 3/5 0 0 0 1 ]) $  Find the matrix that reflects about the line $y=2x-4$.  Move all points over by $4$, reflect about the line $y=2x$ using the prior exercise, and them move them back. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 -4 0 0 1 ]) ([ -3/5 4/5 0 4/5 3/5 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 4 0 0 1 ]) = ([ -3/5 4/5 16/5 4/5 3/5 -8/5 0 0 1 ]) $          Rotation and translation are rigid operations. What is the matrix for a rotation followed by a translation?  $ ([ 1 0 t_x 0 1 t_y 0 0 1 ]) ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) 0 sin(θ) cos(θ) 0 0 0 1 ]) = ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) t_x sin(θ) cos(θ) t_y 0 0 1 ]) $  The homogeneous coordinates extend to manipulations of three dimensional space in the obvious way:~every coordinate is a set of four-tall nonzero vectors that are related by being scalar multiples of each other. Give the matrix to do rotation about the $z$~axis, and the matrix for rotation about the $y$~axis.  Here are the two $N by N$ matrices. $ ([ cos(θ) -sin(θ) 0 0 sin(θ) cos(θ) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ])  ([ cos(θ) 0 -sin(θ) 0 0 0 0 0 sin(θ) 0 cos(θ) 0 0 0 0 1 ]) $           We have shown that for any homomorphism there are bases $B$ and~$D$ such that the matrix representing the map has a block partial-identity form. $ Representation of (h) = ([ Identity Zero  Zero Zero ]) $ This representation describes the map as sending $ c_1vec(β)_1+...+c_nvec(β)_n $ to $c_1vec(δ)_1+...+c_kvec(δ)_k+0+...+0 $, where $n$ is the dimension of the domain and $ k $ is the dimension of the range. Under this representation the action of the map is easy to understand because most of the matrix entries are zero.  This chapter considers the special case where the domain and codomain are the same. Here we naturally ask for the domain basis and codomain basis to be the same. That is, we want a basis $ B $ so that $ Representation of (t) $ is as simple as possible, where we take `simple' to mean that it has many zeroes. We will find that we cannot always get a matrix having the above block partial-identity form but we will develop a form that comes close, a representation that is nearly diagonal.                 This chapter requires that we factor polynomials. But many polynomials do not factor over the real numbers; for instance, $ x^2+1 $ does not factor into a product of two linear polynomials with real coefficients; instead it requires complex numbers $x^2+1=(x-i)(x+i)$.  Consequently in this chapter we shall use complex numbers for our scalars, including entries in vectors and matrices. That is, we shift from studying vector spaces over the real numbers to vector spaces over the complex numbers. Any real number is a complex number and in this chapter most of the examples use only real numbers but nonetheless, the critical theorems require that the scalars be complex.  So this first section is a review of complex numbers.  In this book our approach is to shift to this more general context of taking scalars to be complex for the pragmatic reason that we must do so in order to move forward. However, the idea of doing vector spaces by taking scalars from a structure other than the real numbers is an interesting and useful one. Delightful presentations that take this approach from the start are in and .        textit{This subsection is a review only. For a full development, including proofs, see .}   Consider a polynomial $p(x)=c_nx^n+...+c_1x+c_0$ with leading coefficient $c_n ≠ 0$. The degree of the polynomial is~$n$. If $n=0$ then $p$ is a constant polynomial $p(x)=c_0$. Constant polynomials that are not the zero polynomial, $c_0 ≠ 0$, have degree zero. We define the zero polynomial to have degree $- infty$.    Defining the degree of the zero polynomial to be $- infty$ allows the equation $degree(fg)=degree(f)+degree(g)$ to hold for all polynomials.    Just as integers have a division operation- e.g., `$ 4 $ goes $ 5 $ times into $ 21 $ with remainder $ 1 $'- so do polynomials.   [Division Theorem for Polynomials]   Let $ p(x) $ be a polynomial. If $ d(x) $ is a non-zero polynomial then there are quotient and remainder polynomials $ q(x) $ and $ r(x) $ such that $ p(x)=d(x)· q(x)+r(x) $ where the degree of $ r(x) $ is strictly less than the degree of $ d(x) $.    The point of the integer statement `$ 4 $ goes $ 5 $ times into $ 21 $ with remainder $ 1 $' is that the remainder is less than $ 4 $- while $ 4 $ goes $ 5 $ times, it does not go $ 6 $ times. Similarly, the final clause of the polynomial division statement is crucial.  For example If $ p(x)=2x^3-3x^2+4x $ and $ d(x)=x^2+1 $ then $ q(x)=2x-3 $ and $ r(x)=2x+3 $. Note that $ r(x) $ has a lower degree than does $ d(x) $.     The remainder when $ p(x) $ is divided by $ x-λ $ is the constant polynomial $ r(x)=p(λ) $.      The remainder must be a constant polynomial because it is of degree less than the divisor $ x-λ $. To determine the constant, take the theorem's divisor $d(x)$ to be $x-λ$ and substitute $ λ $ for $x$.     If a divisor $ d(x) $ goes into a dividend $ p(x) $ evenly, meaning that $ r(x) $ is the zero polynomial, then $ d(x) $ is a called a factor of $ p(x) $. Any root of the factor, any $ λ in ℝ $ such that $ d(λ)=0 $, is a root of $ p(x) $ since $ p(λ)=d(λ)· q(λ)=0 $.     If $ λ $ is a root of the polynomial $ p(x) $ then $ x-λ $ divides $ p(x) $ evenly, that is, $x-λ$ is a factor of $p(x)$.      By the above corollary $p(x)=(x-λ)· q(x)+p(λ)$. Since $λ$ is a root, $p(λ)=0$ so $x-λ$ is a factor.    A repeated root of a polynomial is a number $λ$ such that the polynomial is evenly divisible by $(x-λ)^n$ for some power larger than one. The largest such power is called the multiplicity of~$λ$.  Finding the roots and factors of a high-degree polynomial can be hard. But for second-degree polynomials we have the quadratic formula:~the roots of $ ax^2+bx+c $ are these $ λ_1=frac{-b+√{b^2-4ac}}{2a}  λ_2=frac{-b-√{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $ (if the discriminant $ b^2-4ac $ is negative then the polynomial has no real number roots). A polynomial that cannot be factored into two lower-degree polynomials with real number coefficients is said to be irreducible over the reals.    Any constant or linear polynomial is irreducible over the reals. A quadratic polynomial is irreducible over the reals if and only if its discriminant is negative. No cubic or higher-degree polynomial is irreducible over the reals.      Any polynomial with real coefficients can be factored into linear and irreducible quadratic polynomials. That factorization is unique; any two factorizations have the same powers of the same factors.    Note the analogy with the prime factorization of integers. In both cases the uniqueness clause is very useful.  For example Because of uniqueness we know, without multiplying them out, that $ (x+3)^2(x^2+1)^3 $ does not equal $ (x+3)^4(x^2+x+1)^2 $.   For example By uniqueness, if $ c(x)=m(x)· q(x) $ then where $ c(x)=(x-3)^2(x+2)^3 $ and $ m(x)=(x-3)(x+2)^2 $, we know that $ q(x)=(x-3)(x+2) $.    While $ x^2+1 $ has no real roots and so doesn't factor over the real numbers, if we imagine a root- traditionally denoted $ i $, so that $ i^2+1=0 $- then $ x^2+1 $ factors into a product of linears $ (x-i)(x+i) $. When we adjoin this root $ i $ to the reals and close the new system with respect to addition and multiplication then we have the complex numbers $ ℂ={a+bi such that {$a,b inR$ and $i^2=-1$} $. (These are often pictured on a plane with $a$ plotted on the horizontal axis and $b$ on the vertical; note that the distance of the point from the origin is $|a+bi|=√{a^2+b^2}$.)  In $ ℂ $ all quadratics factor. That is, in contrast with the reals, $ ℂ$ has no irreducible quadratics.   $ ax^2+bx+c= a· (x-frac{-b+√{b^2-4ac}}{2a}) · (x-frac{-b-√{b^2-4ac}}{2a}) $  For example The second degree polynomial $ x^2+x+1 $ factors over the complex numbers into the product of two first degree polynomials. $ (x-frac{-1+√{-3}}{2}) (x-frac{-1-√{-3}}{2}) = (x-(-(1/2)+frac{√{3}}{2}i)) (x-(-(1/2)-frac{√{3}}{2}i)) $   [Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]   Polynomials with complex coefficients factor into linear polynomials with complex coefficients. The factorization is unique.                Recall the definitions of the complex number addition $ (a+bi)+(c+di)=(a+c)+(b+d)i $ and multiplication. $ (a+bi)(c+di) =ac+adi+bci+bd(-1) =(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i $   For example For instance, $ (1-2i)+(5+4i)=6+2i $ and $ (2-3i)(4-0.5i)=6.5-13i $.   With these rules, all of the operations that we've used for real vector spaces carry over unchanged to vector spaces with complex scalars.  For example Matrix multiplication is the same, although the scalar arithmetic involves more bookkeeping. $ ([ 1+1i 2-0i i -2+3i ]) ([ 1+0i 1-0i 3i -i ]) $ =([ (1+1i)·(1+0i)+(2-0i)·(3i) (1+1i)·(1-0i)+(2-0i)·(-i) (i)·(1+0i)+(-2+3i)·(3i) (i)·(1-0i)+(-2+3i)·(-i) ]) =([ 1+7i 1-1i -9-5i 3+3i ]) $ $   We shall carry over unchanged from the previous chapters everything that we can. For instance, we shall call this $ sequence{[1+0i 0+0i ... 0+0i], ..., [0+0i 0+0i ... 1+0i]} $ the standard basis  for $ ℂ^n $ as a vector space over $ ℂ$ and again denote it $ stdbasis(_n) $. Another example is that $polyspace(_n)$ will be the vector space of degree~$n$ polynomials with coefficients that are complex.                                                    We've defined two matrices $ H $ and $ Ĥ $ to be matrix equivalent if there are nonsingular $ P $ and $ Q $ such that $ Ĥ=PHQ $. We were motivated by this diagram showing $H$ and $Ĥ$ both representing a map $h$, but with respect to different pairs of bases, $B,D$ and $B̂,D̂$. $  V_{wrt(B)} → (H) W_{wrt(D)} @V{I} VV @V{I} VV V_{wrt(B̂)} → (Ĥ) W_{wrt(D̂)}  $    We now consider the special case of transformations, where the codomain equals the domain, and we add the requirement that the codomain's basis equals the domain's basis. So, we are considering representations with respect to $B,B$ and $D,D$. $  V_{wrt(B)} → (T) V_{wrt(B)} @V{I} VV @V{I} VV V_{wrt(D)} → (T̂) V_{wrt(D)}  $ In matrix terms, $Representation of (t) =Representation of (I)Representation of (t)[(Representation of (I)])^{-1} $.      For example Consider the derivative transformation $d/dx: polyspace(_2) → polyspace(_2)$, and two bases for that space $B=x^2,x,1$ and $D=1,1+x,1+x^2$ We will compute the four sides of the arrow square. $  {polyspace(_2)}_{wrt(B)} → (T) {polyspace(_2)}_{wrt(B)} @V{I} VV @V{I} VV {polyspace(_2)}_{wrt(D)} → (T̂) {polyspace(_2)}_{wrt(D)}  $ The top is first. The effect of the transformation on the starting basis~$B$ $ x^2d/dx ↓ 2x  xd/dx ↓ 1  1d/dx ↓ 0 $ represented with respect to the ending basis (also~$B$) $ Representation of (2x)=[0 2 0]  Representation of (1)=[0 0 1]  Representation of (0)=[0 0 0] $ gives the representation of the map. $ T= Representation of (d/dx)= ([ 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $  Next, the bottom. The effect of the transformation on elements of~$D$ $ 1d/dx ↓ 0  1+xd/dx ↓ 1  1+x^2d/dx ↓ 2x $ represented with respect to~$D$ gives the matrix~$T̂$. $ T̂= Representation of (d/dx)= ([ 0 1 -2 0 0 2 0 0 0 ]) $  Third, computing the matrix for the right-hand side involves finding the effect of the identity map on the elements of~$B$. Of course, the identity map does not transform them at all so to find the matrix we represent $B$'s elements with respect to~$D$. $ Representation of (x^2)=[-1 0 1]  Representation of (x)=[-1 1 0]  Representation of (1)=[1 0 0] $ So the matrix for going down the right side is the concatenation of those. $ P=Representation of (id)= ([ -1 -1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 ]) $  With that, we have two options to compute the matrix for going up on left side. The direct computation represents elements of~$D$ with respect to~$B$ $ Representation of (1)=[0 0 1]  Representation of (1+x)=[0 1 1]  Representation of (1+x^2)=[1 0 1] $ and concatenates to make the matrix. $ ([ 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ]) $ The other option to compute the matrix for going up on the left is to take the inverse of the matrix~$P$ for going down on the right. $ ([ -1 -1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ])      for step $$ ·s for step $$ ([ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]) $     The matrices $ T $ and $T̂$ are similar  if there is a nonsingular $ P $ such that $ T̂=PTP^{-1} $.    Since nonsingular matrices are square, $T$ and $T̂$ must be square and of the same size. checks that similarity is an equivalence relation.  For example The definition does not require that we consider a map. Calculation with these two $ P= ([ 2 1 1 1 ])  T= ([ 2 -3 1 -1 ]) $ gives that $T$ is similar to this matrix. $ T̂= ([ 12 -19 7 -11 ]) $   For example  The only matrix similar to the zero matrix is itself:~$PZP^{-1}=PZ=Z$. The identity matrix has the same property:~$PIP^{-1}=PP^{-1}=I$.     Matrix similarity is a special case of matrix equivalence so if two matrices are similar then they are matrix equivalent. What about the converse:~if they are square, must any two matrix equivalent matrices be similar? No; the matrix equivalence class of an identity matrix consists of all nonsingular matrices of that size while the prior example shows that the only member of the similarity class of an identity matrix is itself. Thus these two are matrix equivalent but not similar. $ T= ([ 1 0 0 1 ])  S= ([ 1 2 0 3 ]) $ So some matrix equivalence classes split into two or more similarity classes- similarity gives a finer partition than does matrix equivalence. This shows some matrix equivalence classes subdivided into similarity classes.     To understand the similarity relation we shall study the similarity classes. We approach this question in the same way that we've studied both the row equivalence and matrix equivalence relations, by finding a canonical form for representatives of the similarity classes, called Jordan form. With this canonical form, we can decide if two matrices are similar by checking whether they are in a class with the same representative. We've also seen with both row equivalence and matrix equivalence that a canonical form gives us insight into the ways in which members of the same class are alike (e.g., two identically-sized matrices are matrix equivalent if and only if they have the same rank).      For $ T= ([ 1 3 -2 -6 ])  T̂= ([ 0 0 -11/2 -5 ])  P= ([ 4 2 -3 2 ]) $ check that $T̂=PTP^{-1}$.  One way to proceed is left to right. $ PTP^{-1}= ([ 4 2 -3 2 ]) ([ 1 3 -2 -6 ]) ([ 2/14 -2/14 3/14 4/14 ]) = ([ 0 0 -7 -21 ]) ([ 2/14 -2/14 3/14 4/14 ]) = ([ 0 0 -11/2 -5 ]) $   shows that the only matrix similar to a zero matrix is itself and that the only matrix similar to the identity is itself.  Show that the $N by N$ matrix whose single entry is $2$ is also similar only to itself. Is a matrix of the form $cI$ for some scalar $c$ similar only to itself? Is a diagonal matrix similar only to itself?      Because the matrix $(2)$ is $N by N$, the matrices $P$ and $P^{-1}$ are also $N by N$ and so where $P=(p)$ the inverse is $P^{-1}=(1/p)$. Thus $P(2)P^{-1}=(p)(2)(1/p)=(2)$. Yes:~recall that we can bring scalar multiples out of a matrix $ P(cI)P^{-1}=cPIP^{-1}=cI $. By the way, the zero and identity matrices are the special cases $c=0$ and $c=1$. No, as this example shows. $ ([ 1 -2 -1 1 ]) ([ -1 0 0 -3 ]) ([ -1 -2 -1 -1 ]) = ([ -5 -4 2 1 ]) $   Consider this transformation of~$ ℂ^3$ $ t([x y z])=[x-z z 2y] $ and these bases. $ B=sequence{[1 2 3], [0 1 0], [0 0 1]}  D=sequence{[1 0 0], [1 1 0], [1 0 1]} $ We will compute the parts of the arrow diagram to represent the transformation using two similar matrices.  Draw the arrow diagram, specialized for this case. Compute $T=Representation of (t)$. Compute $T̂=Representation of (t)$. Compute the matrices for other the two sides of the arrow square.     $  ℂ^3_{wrt(B)} → (T) ℂ^3_{wrt(B)} @V{I} VV @V{I} VV ℂ^3_{wrt(D)} → (T̂) ℂ^3_{wrt(D)}  $  For each element of the starting basis~$B$ find the effect of the transformation $ [1 2 3]t ↓[-2 3 4]  [0 1 0]t ↓[0 0 2]  [0 0 1]t ↓[-1 1 0] $ and represented those outputs with respect to the ending basis~$B$ $ Representation of ([-2 3 4])=[-2 7 10]  Representation of ([0 0 2])=[0 0 2]  Representation of ([-1 1 0])=[-1 3 3] $ to get the matrix. $ T=Representation of (t)= ([ -2 0 -1 7 0 3 10 2 3 ]) $  Find the effect of the transformation on the elements of~$D$ $ [1 0 0]t ↓[1 0 0]  [1 1 0]t ↓[1 0 2]  [1 0 1]t ↓[0 1 0] $ and represented those with respect to the ending basis~$D$ $ Representation of ([1 0 0])=[1 0 0]  Representation of ([1 0 2])=[-1 0 2]  Representation of ([0 1 0])=[-1 1 0] $ to get the matrix. $ T̂=Representation of (t)= ([ 1 -1 -1 0 0 1 0 2 0 ]) $  To go down on the right we need $Representation of (I)$ so we first compute the effect of the identity map on each element of~$D$, which is no effect, and then represent the results with respect to~$B$. $ Representation of ([1 2 3])=[-4 2 3]  Representation of ([0 1 0])=[-1 1 0]  Representation of ([0 0 1])=[-1 0 1] $ So this is~$P$. $ P= ([ -4 -1 -1 2 1 0 3 0 1 ]) $ For the other matrix~$Representation of (I)$ we can either find it directly, as we just have with~$P$, or we can do the usual calculation of a matrix inverse. $ P^{-1}= ([ 1 1 1 -2 -1 -2 -3 -3 -2 ]) $    Consider the transformation $t: polyspace(_2) → polyspace(_2)$ described by $x^2↦ x+1$, $x↦ x^2-1$, and $1↦ 3$.  Find $T=Representation of (t)$ where $B=x^2,x,1$. Find $T̂=Representation of (t)$ where $D=1,1+x,1+x+x^2$. Find the matrix $P$ such that $T̂=PTP^{-1}$.    Because we describe $t$ with the members of $B$, finding the matrix representation is easy: $ Representation of (t(x^2))=[0 1 1]_B  Representation of (t(x))=[1 0 -1]_B  Representation of (t(1))=[0 0 3]_B $ gives this. $ Representation of (t) ([ 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 -1 3 ]) $ We will find $t(1)$, $t(1+x)$, and $t(1+x+x^2$, to find how each is represented with respect to $D$. We are given that $t(1)=3$, and the other two are easy to see: $t(1+x)=x^2+2$ and $t(1+x+x^2)=x^2+x+3$. By eye, we get the representation of each vector $ Representation of (t(1))=[3 0 0]_D  Representation of (t(1+x))=[2 -1 1]_D  Representation of (t(1+x+x^2))=[2 0 1]_D $ and thus the representation of the map. $ Representation of (t) = ([ 3 2 2 0 -1 0 0 1 1 ]) $ The diagram $  V_{wrt(B)} → (T) V_{wrt(B)} @VI VPV @VI VPV V_{wrt(D)} → (T̂) V_{wrt(D)}  $ shows that these are $P=Representation of (I)$ and $P^{-1}=Representation of (I)$. $ P= ([ 0 -1 1 -1 1 0 1 0 0 ])  P^{-1}= ([ 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 ]) $    Let $T$ represent $t: ℂ^2 → ℂ^2$ with respect to $B,B$. $ T= ([ 1 -1 2 1 ])  B=[1 0],[1 1], D=[2 0],[0 -2] $ We will convert to the matrix representing~$t$ with resepct to $D,D$.  Draw the arrow diagram. Give the matrix that represents the left and right sides of that diagram, in the direction that we traverse the diagram to make the conversion. Find $Representation of (t)$.     $  ℂ^2_{wrt(B)} → (T) ℂ^2_{wrt(B)} @V{I} VV @V{I} VV ℂ^2_{wrt(D)} → (T̂) ℂ^2_{wrt(D)}  $  For the right side we find the effect of the identity map, which is no effect, $ [1 0]I ↓[1 0]  [1 1]I ↓[1 1] $ and represent those with respect to~$D$ $ Representation of ([1 0])=[1/2 0]  Representation of ([1 1])=[1/2 -1/2] $ so we have this. $ P=Representation of (I)= ([ 1/2 1/2 0 -1/2 ]) $  For the matrix on the left we can either compute it directly, as in the prior paragraph, or we can take the inverse. $ P^{-1}=Representation of (I)= (1/(-1/4))· ([ -1/2 -1/2 0 1/2 ]) = ([ 2 2 0 -2 ]) $  As with the prior item we can either compute it directly from the definition or compute it using matrix operations. $ PTP^{-1}= ([ 2 2 0 -2 ]) ([ 1 -1 2 1 ]) ([ 2 2 0 -2 ]) = ([ 3 3 -2 -1 ]) $    Exhibit an nontrivial similarity relationship by letting $ t: ℂ^2 → ℂ^2 $ act in this way, $ [1 2]↦[3 0]  [-1 1]↦[-1 2] $ picking two bases~$B,D$, and representing $ t $ with respect to them, $ T̂=Representation of (t) $ and $ T=Representation of (t) $. Then compute the $ P $ and $ P^{-1} $ to change bases from $ B $ to $ D $ and back again.  One possible choice of the bases is $ B=[1 2],[-1 1]  D=stdbasis(_2)=[1 0],[0 1] $ (this $B$ comes from the map description). To find the matrix $T̂=Representation of (t)$, solve the relations $ c_1[1 2]+c_2[-1 1]=[3 0]  ĉ_1[1 2]+ĉ_2[-1 1]=[-1 2] $ to get $ c_1=1 $, $ c_2=-2 $, $ ĉ_1=1/3 $ and $ ĉ_2=4/3 $. $ Representation of (t)= ([ 1 1/3 -2 4/3 ]) $  Finding $ Representation of (t) $ involves a bit more computation. We first find $ t(vec(e)_1) $. The relation $ c_1[1 2]+c_2[-1 1]=[1 0] $ gives $ c_1=1/3 $ and $ c_2=-2/3 $, and so $ rep{vec(e)_1}{B}=[1/3 -2/3]_B $ making $ rep{t(vec(e)_1)}{B}= ([ 1 1/3 -2 4/3 ])_{B,B} [1/3 -2/3]_B = [1/9 -14/9]_B $ and hence $t$ acts on the first basis vector $vec(e)_1$ in this way. $ t(vec(e)_1) =(1/9)·[1 2]-(14/9)·[-1 1] =[5/3 -4/3] $ The computation for $ t(vec(e)_2) $ is similar. The relation $ c_1[1 2]+c_2[-1 1]=[0 1] $ gives $ c_1=1/3 $ and $ c_2=1/3 $, so $ rep{vec(e)_1}{B}=[1/3 1/3]_B $ making $ rep{t(vec(e)_1)}{B}= ([ 1 1/3 -2 4/3 ])_{B,B} [1/3 1/3]_B = [4/9 -2/9]_B $ and hence $t$ acts on the second basis vector $vec(e)_2$ in this way. $ t(vec(e)_2) =(4/9)·[1 2]-(2/9)·[-1 1] =[2/3 2/3] $ Therefore $ Representation of (t)= ([ 5/3 2/3 -4/3 2/3 ]) $ and so this matrix. $ P=Representation of (I) =([ 1 -1 2 1 ]) $ and this one change the bases. $ P^{-1}=[(Representation of (I)])^{-1} =([ 1 -1 2 1 ])^{-1} = ([ 1/3 1/3 -2/3 1/3 ]) $ The check of these computations is routine. $ ([ 1 -1 2 1 ]) ([ 1 1/3 -2 4/3 ]) ([ 1/3 1/3 -2/3 1/3 ]) = ([ 5/3 2/3 -4/3 2/3 ]) $   Show that these matrices are not similar. $ ([ 1 0 4 1 1 3 2 1 7 ])  ([ 1 0 1 0 1 1 3 1 2 ]) $  Gauss's Method shows that the first matrix represents maps of rank two while the second matrix represents maps of rank three.   Explain in terms of maps.  The only representation of a zero map is a zero matrix, no matter what the pair of bases $Representation of (z)=Z$, and so in particular for any single basis $B$ we have $Representation of (z)=Z$. The case of the identity is slightly different:~the only representation of the identity map, with respect to any $B,B$, is the identity $Representation of (I)=I$. (Remark:~of course, we have seen examples where $B ≠ D$ and $Representation of (I) ≠ I$- in fact, we have seen that any nonsingular matrix is a representation of the identity map with respect to some $B,D$.)    Are there two matrices $ A $ and $ B $ that are similar while $ A^2 $ and $ B^2 $ are not similar?  No. If $ A=PBP^{-1} $ then $ A^2=(PBP^{-1})(PBP^{-1})=PB^2P^{-1} $.   Prove that if two matrices are similar and one is invertible then so is the other.  Matrix similarity is a special case of matrix equivalence (if matrices are similar then they are matrix equivalent) and matrix equivalence preserves nonsingularity.   Show that similarity is an equivalence relation. (The definition given earlier already reflects this, so instead start here with the definition that $T̂$ is similar to $T$ if $T̂=PTP^{-1}$.)  A matrix is similar to itself; take $ P $ to be the identity matrix:~$P=IPI^{-1}=IPI$.  If $ T̂ $ is similar to $ T $ then $ T̂=PTP^{-1} $ and so $ P^{-1}T̂P=T $. Rewrite $ T=(P^{-1})T̂(P^{-1})^{-1} $ to conclude that $T$ is similar to $ T̂ $.  For transitivity, if $ T $ is similar to $ S $ and $ S $ is similar to $ U $ then $ T=PSP^{-1} $ and $ S=QUQ^{-1} $. Then $ T=PQUQ^{-1}P^{-1}=(PQ)U(PQ)^{-1} $, showing that $ T $ is similar to $ U $.   Consider a matrix representing, with respect to some $B,B$, reflection across the $ x $-axis in $ ℝ^2 $. Consider also a matrix representing, with respect to some $D,D$, reflection across the $ y $-axis. Must they be similar?  Let $f_x$ and $f_y$ be the reflection maps (sometimes called `flip's). For any bases $ B $ and $ D $, the matrices $ Representation of (f_x) $ and $ Representation of (f_y) $ are similar. First note that $ S=Representation of (f_x)= ([ 1 0 0 -1 ])  T=Representation of (f_y)= ([ -1 0 0 1 ]) $ are similar because the second matrix is the representation of $f_x$ with respect to the basis $ A=sequence{vec(e)_2,vec(e)_1} $: $ ([ 1 0 0 -1 ]) = P ([ -1 0 0 1 ]) P^{-1} $ where $P=Representation of (I)$. $  ℝ^2_{wrt(A)} → (T) V ℝ^2_{wrt(A)} @VI VPV @VI VPV ℝ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} → (S) ℝ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)}  $ Now the conclusion follows from the transitivity part of .  We can also finish without relying on that exercise. Write $Representation of (f_x)=QTQ^{-1}=QRepresentation of (f_x)Q^{-1}$ and $Representation of (f_y)=RSR^{-1}=RRepresentation of (f_y)R^{-1}$. By the equation in the first paragraph, the first of these two is $Representation of (f_x)=QPRepresentation of (f_y)P^{-1}Q^{-1}$. Rewriting the second of these two as $R^{-1}·Representation of (f_y)· R=Representation of (f_y)$ and substituting gives the desired relationship $ Representation of (f_x) =QPRepresentation of (f_y)P^{-1}Q^{-1} =QPR^{-1}·Representation of (f_y)· RP^{-1}Q^{-1} =(QPR^{-1})·Representation of (f_y)· (QPR^{-1})^{-1} $ Thus the matrices $ Representation of (f_x) $ and $ Representation of (f_y) $ are similar.   Prove that similarity preserves determinants and rank. Does the converse hold?  We must show that if two matrices are similar then they have the same determinant and the same rank. Both determinant and rank are properties of matrices that are preserved by matrix equivalence. They are therefore preserved by similarity (which is a special case of matrix equivalence:~if two matrices are similar then they are matrix equivalent).  To prove the statement without quoting the results about matrix equivalence, note first that rank is a property of the map (it is the dimension of the range space) and since we've shown that the rank of a map is the rank of a representation, it must be the same for all representations. As for determinants, $ deter{PSP^{-1}}=determinant(P)·determinant(S)·deter{P^{-1}} =determinant(P)·determinant(S)·determinant(P)^{-1}=determinant(S) $.  The converse of the statement does not hold; for instance, there are matrices with the same determinant that are not similar. To check this, consider a nonzero matrix with a determinant of zero. It is not similar to the zero matrix, the zero matrix is similar only to itself, but they have they same determinant. The argument for rank is much the same.   Is there a matrix equivalence class with only one matrix similarity class inside? One with infinitely many similarity classes?  The matrix equivalence class containing all $ N by N $ rank zero matrices contains only a single matrix, the zero matrix. Therefore it has as a subset only one similarity class.  In contrast, the matrix equivalence class of $ N by N $ matrices of rank one consists of those $N by N$ matrices $ (k) $ where $ k ≠ 0 $. For any basis $ B $, the representation of multiplication by the scalar $ k $ is $ Representation of (t_k)=(k) $, so each such matrix is alone in its similarity class. So this is a case where a matrix equivalence class splits into infinitely many similarity classes.   Can two different diagonal matrices be in the same similarity class?  Yes, these are similar $ ([ 1 0 0 3 ])  ([ 3 0 0 1 ]) $ since, where the first matrix is $Representation of (t)$ for $B=sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2}$, the second matrix is $Representation of (t)$ for $D=sequence{vec(β)_2,vec(β)_1}$.   Prove that if two matrices are similar then their $ k $-th powers are similar when $ k>0 $. What if $ k≤ 0 $?  The $ k $-th powers are similar because, where each matrix represents the map $t$, the $k$-th powers represent $ t^k $, the composition of $k$-many $t$'s. (For instance, if $T=rep{t}{B,B}$ then $T^2=rep{∘{t}{t}}{B,B}$.)  Restated more computationally, if $ T=PSP^{-1} $ then $ T^2=(PSP^{-1})(PSP^{-1})=PS^2P^{-1} $. Induction extends that to all powers.  For the $k≤ 0$ case, suppose that $ S $ is invertible and that $ T=PSP^{-1} $. Note that $ T $ is invertible: $ T^{-1}=(PSP^{-1})^{-1}=PS^{-1}P^{-1} $, and that same equation shows that $ T^{-1} $ is similar to $ S^{-1} $. Other negative powers are now given by the first paragraph.   Let $ p(x) $ be the polynomial $ c_nx^n+·s+c_1x+c_0 $. Show that if $ T $ is similar to $ S $ then $ p(T)=c_nT^n+·s+c_1T+c_0I $ is similar to $ p(S)=c_nS^n+·s+c_1S+c_0I $.  In conceptual terms, both represent $ p(t) $ for some transformation $ t $. In computational terms, we have this. $ p(T) =c_n(PSP^{-1})^n+...+c_1(PSP^{-1})+c_0I =c_nPS^nP^{-1}+...+c_1PSP^{-1}+c_0I =Pc_nS^nP^{-1}+...+Pc_1SP^{-1}+Pc_0P^{-1} =P(c_nS^n+...+c_1S+c_0)P^{-1} $   List all of the matrix equivalence classes of $ N by N $ matrices. Also list the similarity classes, and describe which similarity classes are contained inside of each matrix equivalence class.  There are two equivalence classes, (i)~the class of rank~zero matrices, of which there is one: $𝒞_1={(0)}$, and (2)~the class of rank~one matrices, of which there are infinitely many: $ 𝒞_2={(k) such that k ≠0} $.  Each $ N by N $ matrix is alone in its similarity class. That's because any transformation of a one-dimensional space is multiplication by a scalar $t_k: V → V$ given by $vec(v)↦ k·vec(v)$. Thus, for any basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)} $, the matrix representing a transformation $ t_k $ with respect to $ B,B $ is $ (rep{t_k(vec(β))}{B})=(k) $.  So, contained in the matrix equivalence class $𝒞_1$ is (obviously) the single similarity class consisting of the matrix $(0)$. And, contained in the matrix equivalence class $𝒞_2$ are the infinitely many, one-member-each, similarity classes consisting of $(k)$ for $k ≠0$.   Does similarity preserve sums?  No. Here is an example that has two pairs, each of two similar matrices: $ ([ 1 -1 1 2 ]) ([ 1 0 0 3 ]) ([ 2/3 1/3 -1/3 1/3 ]) = ([ 5/3 -2/3 -4/3 7/3 ]) $ and $ ([ 1 -2 -1 1 ]) ([ -1 0 0 -3 ]) ([ -1 -2 -1 -1 ]) = ([ -5 -4 2 1 ]) $ (this example is not entirely arbitrary because the center matrices on the two left sides add to the zero matrix). Note that the sums of these similar matrices are not similar $ ([ 1 0 0 3 ]) + ([ -1 0 0 -3 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 ])  ([ 5/3 -2/3 -4/3 7/3 ]) + ([ -5 -4 2 1 ]) ≠ ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) $ since the zero matrix is similar only to itself.   Show that if $ T-λ I $ and $ N $ are similar matrices then $ T $ and $ N+λ I $ are also similar.  If $ N=P(T-λ I)P^{-1} $ then $ N=PTP^{-1}-P(λ I)P^{-1} $. The diagonal matrix $ λ I $ commutes with anything, so $ P(λ I)P^{-1}=PP^{-1}(λ I)=λ I $. Thus $ N=PTP^{-1}-λ I $ and consequently $ N+λ I=PTP^{-1} $. (So not only are they similar, in fact they are similar via the same $ P $.)                     The prior subsection shows that although similar matrices are necessarily matrix equivalent, the converse does not hold. Some matrix equivalence classes break into two or more similarity classes; for instance, the nonsingular $N by N$ matrices form one matrix equivalence class but more than one similarity class.  Thus we cannot use the canonical form for matrix equivalence, a block partial-identity matrix, as a canonical form for matrix similarity. The diagram below illustrates. The stars are similarity class representatives. Each dashed-line similarity class subdivision has one star but each solid-curve matrix equivalence class division has only one partial identity matrix.    To develop a canonical form for representatives of the similarity classes we naturally build on previous work. This means first that the partial identity matrices should represent the similarity classes into which they fall. Beyond that, the representatives should be as simple as possible.  The simplest extension of the partial identity form is the diagonal form.    A transformation is diagonalizable  if it has a diagonal representation with respect to the same basis for the codomain as for the domain. A diagonalizable matrix is one that is similar to a diagonal matrix:~$ T $ is diagonalizable if there is a nonsingular $ P $ such that $ PTP^{-1} $ is diagonal.    For example The matrix $ ([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) $ is diagonalizable. $ ([ 2 0 0 3 ]) = ([ -1 2 1 -1 ]) ([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) ([ -1 2 1 -1 ])^{-1} $   For example  We will show that this matrix is not diagonalizable. $ N=([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $ The fact that $N$ is not the zero matrix means that it cannot be similar to the zero matrix, because the zero matrix is similar only to itself. Thus if $N$ were to be similar to a diagonal matrix then that matrix would have have at least one nonzero entry on its diagonal.  The square of $N$ is the zero matrix. This imples that for any map~$n$ represented by $ N $ (with respect to some $B,B$) the composition $ ∘{n}{n} $ is the zero map. This in turn implies that for any matrix representing~$n$ (with respect to some $B̂,B̂$), its square is the zero matrix. But the square of a nonzero diagonal matrix cannot be the zero matrix, because the square of a diagonal matrix is the diagonal matrix whose entries are the squares of the entries from the starting matrix. Thus there is no $B̂,B̂$ such that $n$ is represented by a diagonal matrix- the matrix $N$ is not diagonalizable.    That example shows that a diagonal form will not suffice as a canonical form for similarity- we cannot find a diagonal matrix in each matrix similarity class. However, some similarity classes contain a diagonal matrix and the canonical form that we are developing has the property that if a matrix can be diagonalized then the diagonal matrix is the canonical representative of its similarity class.     A transformation $ t $ is diagonalizable if and only if there is a basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_n } $ and scalars $ λ_1,...,λ_n $ such that $ t(vec(β)_i)=λ_ivec(β)_i $ for each $ i $.      Consider a diagonal representation matrix. $ Representation of (t)= ([ ... ... rep{t(vec(β)_1)}{B} ·s rep{t(vec(β)_n)}{B} ... ... ]) = ([ λ_1 0 ... ... ... 0 λ_n ]) $ Consider the representation of a member of this basis with respect to the basis $rep{vec(β)_i}{B}$. The product of the diagonal matrix and the representation vector $ rep{t(vec(β)_i)}{B} =([ λ_1 0 ... ... ... 0 λ_n ]) [0 ... 1 ... 0] =[0 ... λ_i ... 0] $ has the stated action.    For example To diagonalize $ T=([ 3 2 0 1 ]) $ we take $T$ as the representation of a transformation with respect to the standard basis $Representation of (t)$ and look for a basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2} $ such that $ Representation of (t) = ([ λ_1 0 0 λ_2 ]) $ that is, such that $t(vec(β)_1)=λ_1vec(β)_1$ and $t(vec(β)_2)=λ_2vec(β)_2$. $ ([ 3 2 0 1 ]) vec(β)_1=λ_1·vec(β)_1  ([ 3 2 0 1 ]) vec(β)_2=λ_2·vec(β)_2 $ We are looking for scalars $ x $ such that this equation $ ([ 3 2 0 1 ]) [b_1 b_2]=x·[b_1 b_2] $ has solutions $b_1$ and $b_2$ that are not both $0$ (the zero vector is not the member of any basis). That's a linear system. $ $ (3-x)· b_1 + 2· b_2 = 0 (1-x)· b_2 = 0 $ $ Focus first on the bottom equation. There are two cases: either $b_2=0$ or~$x=1$.  In the $ b_2=0 $ case the first equation gives that either $b_1=0$ or $ x=3 $. Since we've disallowed the possibility that both $b_2=0$ and~$b_1=0$, we are left with the first diagonal entry $λ_1=3$. With that, ($*$)'s first equation is $0· b_1+2· b_2=0$ and so associated with $λ_1=3$ are vectors having a second component of zero while the first component is free. $ ([ 3 2 0 1 ]) [b_1 0]=3·[b_1 0] $ To get a first basis vector choose any nonzero $b_1$. $ vec(β)_1=[1 0] $  The other case for the bottom equation of ($*$) is $λ_2=1$. Then ($*$)'s first equation is $2· b_1+2· b_2=0$ and so associated with this case are vectors whose second component is the negative of the first. $ ([ 3 2 0 1 ]) [b_1 -b_1]=1·[b_1 -b_1] $ Get the second basis vector by choosing a nonzero one of these. $ vec(β)_2=[1 -1] $  Now draw the similarity diagram $  ℝ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} → (T) ℝ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} @V{I} VV @V{I} VV ℝ^2_{wrt(B)} → (D) ℝ^2_{wrt(B)}  $ and note that the matrix $Representation of (I)$ is easy, giving this diagonalization. $ ([ 3 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 1 1 0 -1 ])^{-1} ([ 3 2 0 1 ]) ([ 1 1 0 -1 ]) $   In the next subsection we will expand on that example by considering more closely the property of . This includes seeing a streamlined way to find the $λ$'s.     Repeat for the matrix from .  Because we chose the basis vectors arbitrarily, many different answers are possible. However, here is one way to go; to diagonalize $ T=([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) $ take it as the representation of a transformation with respect to the standard basis $T=Representation of (t)$ and look for $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2} $ such that $ Representation of (t) = ([ λ_1 0 0 λ_2 ]) $ that is, such that $t(vec(β)_1)=λ_1$ and $t(vec(β)_2)=λ_2$. $ ([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) vec(β)_1=λ_1·vec(β)_1  ([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) vec(β)_2=λ_2·vec(β)_2 $ We are looking for scalars $ x $ such that this equation $ ([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) [b_1 b_2]=x·[b_1 b_2] $ has solutions $b_1$ and $b_2$, which are not both zero. Rewrite that as a linear system $ $ (4-x)· b_1 + -2· b_2 = 0 1· b_1 + (1-x)· b_2 = 0 $ $ If $x=4$ then the first equation gives that $b_2=0$, and then the second equation gives that $b_1=0$. We have disallowed the case where both $b$'s are zero so we can assume that $x ≠ 4$. $ for step $(-1/(4-x))ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ (4-x)· b_1 + -2· b_2 = 0 ((x^2-5x+6)/(4-x))· b_2 = 0 $ $ Consider the bottom equation. If $ b_2=0 $ then the first equation gives $b_1=0$ or $x=4$. The $b_1=b_2=0$ case is not allowed. The other possibility for the bottom equation is that the numerator of the fraction $x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3)$ is zero. The $x=2$ case gives a first equation of $2b_1-2b_2=0$, and so associated with $x=2$ we have vectors whose first and second components are equal: $ vec(β)_1=[1 1] text{(so $ ([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) [1 1]=2·[1 1] $, and $λ_1=2$).} $ If $ x=3 $ then the first equation is $b_1-2b_2=0$ and so the associated vectors are those whose first component is twice their second: $ vec(β)_2=[2 1] text{(so $ ([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) [2 1]=3·[2 1] $, and so $λ_2=3$).} $ This picture $  ℝ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} → (T) ℝ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} @V{I} VV @V{I} VV ℝ^2_{wrt(B)} → (D) ℝ^2_{wrt(B)}  $ shows how to get the diagonalization. $ ([ 2 0 0 3 ]) = ([ 1 2 1 1 ])^{-1} ([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) ([ 1 2 1 1 ]) $ Comment. This equation matches the $T=PSP^{-1}$ definition under this renaming. $ T= ([ 2 0 0 3 ])  P= ([ 1 2 1 1 ])^{-1}  P^{-1}= ([ 1 2 1 1 ])  S= ([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) $   Diagonalize these upper triangular matrices.   $([ -2 1 0 2 ])$  $([ 5 4 0 1 ])$     Setting up $ ([ -2 1 0 2 ]) [b_1 b_2] =x·[b_1 b_2] --> $ (-2-x)· b_1 + b_2 = 0 (2-x)· b_2 = 0 $ $ gives the two possibilities that $b_2=0$ and $x=2$. Following the $b_2=0$ possibility leads to the first equation $(-2-x)b_1=0$ with the two cases that $b_1=0$ and that $x=-2$. Thus, under this first possibility, we find $x=-2$ and the associated vectors whose second component is zero, and whose first component is free. $ ([ -2 1 0 2 ]) [b_1 0] =-2·[b_1 0]  vec(β)_1=[1 0] $ Following the other possibility leads to a first equation of $-4b_1+b_2=0$ and so the vectors associated with this solution have a second component that is four times their first component. $ ([ -2 1 0 2 ]) [b_1 4b_1] =2·[b_1 4b_1]  vec(β)_2=[1 4] $ The diagonalization is this. $ ([ 1 1 0 4 ]) ([ -2 1 0 2 ]) ([ 1 1 0 4 ])^{-1} = ([ -2 0 0 2 ]) $ The calculations are like those in the prior part. $ ([ 5 4 0 1 ]) [b_1 b_2] =x·[b_1 b_2] --> $ (5-x)· b_1 + 4· b_2 = 0 (1-x)· b_2 = 0 $ $ The bottom equation gives the two possibilities that $b_2=0$ and $x=1$. Following the $b_2=0$ possibility, and discarding the case where both $b_2$ and $b_1$ are zero, gives that $x=5$, associated with vectors whose second component is zero and whose first component is free. $ vec(β)_1=[1 0] $ The $x=1$ possibility gives a first equation of $4b_1+4b_2=0$ and so the associated vectors have a second component that is the negative of their first component. $ vec(β)_1=[1 -1] $ We thus have this diagonalization. $ ([ 1 1 0 -1 ]) ([ 5 4 0 1 ]) ([ 1 1 0 -1 ])^{-1} = ([ 5 0 0 1 ]) $    What form do the powers of a diagonal matrix have?  For any integer $ p $, we have this. $ ([ d_1 0 0 ... d_n ])^p= ([ d_1^p 0 0 ... d_n^p ]) $   Give two same-sized diagonal matrices that are not similar. Must any two different diagonal matrices come from different similarity classes?  These two are not similar $ ([ 0 0 0 0 ])  ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $ because each is alone in its similarity class.  For the second half, these $ ([ 2 0 0 3 ])  ([ 3 0 0 2 ]) $ are similar via the matrix that changes bases from $ sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2} $ to $ sequence{vec(β)_2,vec(β)_1} $. (Question. Are two diagonal matrices similar if and only if their diagonal entries are permutations of each others?)   Give a nonsingular diagonal matrix. Can a diagonal matrix ever be singular?  Contrast these two. $ ([ 2 0 0 1 ])  ([ 2 0 0 0 ]) $ The first is nonsingular, the second is singular.   Show that the inverse of a diagonal matrix is the diagonal of the the inverses, if no element on that diagonal is zero. What happens when a diagonal entry is zero?  To check that the inverse of a diagonal matrix is the diagonal matrix of the inverses, just multiply. $ ([ a_{1,1} 0 0 a_{2,2} ... a_{n,n} ]) ([ 1/a_{1,1} 0 0 1/a_{2,2} ... 1/a_{n,n} ]) $ (Showing that it is a left inverse is just as easy.)  If a diagonal entry is zero then the diagonal matrix is singular; it has a zero determinant.   The equation ending $ ([ 1 1 0 -1 ])^{-1} ([ 3 2 0 1 ]) ([ 1 1 0 -1 ]) = ([ 3 0 0 1 ]) $ is a bit jarring because for $P$ we must take the first matrix, which is shown as an inverse, and for $P^{-1}$ we take the inverse of the first matrix, so that the two $-1$ powers cancel and this matrix is shown without a superscript $-1$.  Check that this nicer-appearing equation holds. $ ([ 3 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 1 1 0 -1 ]) ([ 3 2 0 1 ]) ([ 1 1 0 -1 ])^{-1} $ Is the previous item a coincidence? Or can we always switch the $P$ and the $P^{-1}$?    The check is easy. $ ([ 1 1 0 -1 ]) ([ 3 2 0 1 ]) = ([ 3 3 0 -1 ])  ([ 3 3 0 -1 ]) ([ 1 1 0 -1 ])^{-1} = ([ 3 0 0 1 ]) $ It is a coincidence, in the sense that if $T=PSP^{-1}$ then $T$ need not equal $P^{-1}SP$. Even in the case of a diagonal matrix~$D$, the condition that $D=PTP^{-1}$ does not imply that $D$ equals $P^{-1}TP$. The matrices from show this. $ ([ 1 2 1 1 ]) ([ 4 -2 1 1 ]) = ([ 6 0 5 -1 ])  ([ 6 0 5 -1 ]) ([ 1 2 1 1 ])^{-1} = ([ -6 12 -6 11 ]) $    Show that the $P$ used to diagonalize in is not unique.  The columns of the matrix are the vectors associated with the $x$'s. The exact choice, and the order of the choice was arbitrary. We could, for instance, get a different matrix by swapping the two columns.   Find a formula for the powers of this matrix Hint:~see . $ ([ -3 1 -4 2 ]) $  Diagonalizing and then taking powers of the diagonal matrix shows that $ ([ -3 1 -4 2 ])^k = (1/3) ([ -1 1 -4 4 ]) +((-2/3))^k ([ 4 -1 4 -1 ]). $   Diagonalize these.  $ ([ 1 1 0 0 ]) $ $ ([ 0 1 1 0 ]) $    $ ([ 1 1 0 -1 ])^{-1} ([ 1 1 0 0 ]) ([ 1 1 0 -1 ]) =([ 1 0 0 0 ]) $ $ ([ 1 1 0 -1 ])^{-1} ([ 0 1 1 0 ]) ([ 1 1 0 -1 ]) =([ 1 0 0 -1 ]) $    We can ask how diagonalization interacts with the matrix operations. Assume that $ t,s: V → V $ are each diagonalizable. Is $ ct $ diagonalizable for all scalars $ c $? What about $ t+s $? $ ∘{t}{s} $?  Yes, $ ct $ is diagonalizable by the final theorem of this subsection.  No, $ t+s $ need not be diagonalizable. Intuitively, the problem arises when the two maps diagonalize with respect to different bases (that is, when they are not simultaneously diagonalizable). Specifically, these two are diagonalizable but their sum is not: $ ([ 1 1 0 0 ])  ([ -1 0 0 0 ]) $ (the second is already diagonal; for the first, see ). The sum is not diagonalizable because its square is the zero matrix.  The same intuition suggests that $ ∘{t}{s} $ is not be diagonalizable. These two are diagonalizable but their product is not: $ ([ 1 0 0 0 ])  ([ 0 1 1 0 ]) $ (for the second, see ).   Show that matrices of this form are not diagonalizable. $ ([ 1 c 0 1 ]) c ≠ 0 $  If $ P ([ 1 c 0 1 ]) P^{-1} = ([ a 0 0 b ]) $ then $ P ([ 1 c 0 1 ]) = ([ a 0 0 b ]) P $ so $ ([ p q r s ]) ([ 1 c 0 1 ]) = ([ a 0 0 b ]) ([ p q r s ]) ([ p cp+q r cr+s ]) = ([ ap aq br bs ]) $ The $ 1,1 $ entries show that $ a=1 $ and the $ 1,2 $ entries then show that $ pc=0 $. Since $ c ≠ 0 $ this means that $ p=0 $. The $ 2,1 $ entries show that $ b=1 $ and the $ 2,2 $ entries then show that $ rc=0 $. Since $ c ≠ 0 $ this means that $ r=0 $. But if both $ p $ and $ r $ are $ 0 $ then $ P $ is not invertible.   Show that each of these is diagonalizable.   $ ([ 1 2 2 1 ]) $  $ ([ x y y z ]) $x,y,z$ scalars $    Using the formula for the inverse of a $N by N$ matrix gives this. $ ([ a b c d ]) ([ 1 2 2 1 ]) ·(1/ad-bc)· ([ d -b -c a ]) =(1/ad-bc) ([ ad+2bd-2ac-bc -ab-2b^2+2a^2+ab cd+2d^2-2c^2-cd -bc-2bd+2ac+ad ]) $ Now pick scalars $ a,...,d $ so that $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $ and $ 2d^2-2c^2=0 $ and $ 2a^2-2b^2=0 $. For example, these will do. $ ([ 1 1 1 -1 ]) ([ 1 2 2 1 ]) ·(1/-2)· ([ -1 -1 -1 1 ]) = (1/-2) ([ -6 0 0 2 ]) $ As above, $ ([ a b c d ]) ([ x y y z ]) ·(1/ad-bc)· ([ d -b -c a ]) =(1/ad-bc) ([ adx+bdy-acy-bcz -abx-b^2y+a^2y+abz cdx+d^2y-c^2y-cdz -bcx-bdy+acy+adz ]) $ we are looking for scalars $ a,...,d $ so that $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $ and $ -abx-b^2y+a^2y+abz=0 $ and $ cdx+d^2y-c^2y-cdz=0 $, no matter what values $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $ have.  For starters, we assume that $ y ≠ 0 $, else the given matrix is already diagonal. We shall use that assumption because if we (arbitrarily) let $ a=1 $ then we get $ -bx-b^2y+y+bz =0 (-y)b^2+(z-x)b+y =0 $ and the quadratic formula gives $ b=frac{-(z-x)±√{(z-x)^2-4(-y)(y)} }{-2y}  y ≠ 0 $ (note that if $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $ are real then these two $ b $'s are real as the discriminant is positive). By the same token, if we (arbitrarily) let $ c=1 $ then $ dx+d^2y-y-dz =0 (y)d^2+(x-z)d-y =0 $ and we get here $ d=frac{-(x-z)±√{(x-z)^2-4(y)(-y)} }{2y}  y ≠ 0 $ (as above, if $ x,y,z in ℝ $ then this discriminant is positive so a symmetric, real, $ N by N $ matrix is similar to a real diagonal matrix).  For a check we try $ x=1 $, $ y=2 $, $ z=1 $. $ b=frac{0±√{0+16} }{-4}=∓ 1  d=frac{0±√{0+16} }{4}=± 1 $ Note that not all four choices $ (b,d)=(+1,+1),...,(-1,-1) $ satisfy $ ad-bc ≠ 0 $.                                     We will next focus on the property of .    A transformation $ t: V → V $ has a scalar eigenvalue  $ λ $ if there is a nonzero eigenvector $ vec(ζ) in V $ such that $ t(vec(ζ))=λ·vec(ζ) $.    (``Eigen'' is German for ``characteristic of'' or ``peculiar to.'' Some authors call these characteristic values and vectors. No authors call them ``peculiar.'')  For example The projection map $ [x y z] π ↓ [x y 0] x,y,z in ℂ $ has an eigenvalue of $ 1 $ associated with any eigenvector $ [x y 0] $ where $ x $ and $ y $ are scalars that are not both zero.  In contrast, a number that is not an eigenvalue of of this map is $ 2 $, since assuming that $π$ doubles a vector leads to the equations $x=2x$, $y=2y$, and $0=2z$, and thus no non-$0$ vector is doubled.   Note that the definition requires that the eigenvector be non-$0$. Some authors allow $0$ as an eigenvector for $λ$ as long as there are also non-$0$ vectors associated with $λ$. The key point is to disallow the trivial case where $λ$ is such that $t(vec(v))=λvec(v)$ for only the single vector $vec(v)=0$.  Also, note that the eigenvalue $λ$ could be~$0$. The issue is whether $vec(ζ)$ equals $0$.  For example The only transformation on the trivial space $ {0} $ is  $0↦0$.  This map has no eigenvalues because there are no non-$ 0 $ vectors $vec(v)$ mapped to a scalar multiple $λ·vec(v)$ of themselves.   For example Consider the homomorphism $ t: polyspace(_1) → polyspace(_1) $ given by $ c_0+c_1x↦(c_0+c_1)+(c_0+c_1)x $. While the codomain $polyspace(_1)$ of $t$ is two-dimensional, its range is one-dimensional $t={c+cx such that c in ℂ}$. Application of $ t $ to a vector in that range will simply rescale the vector $ c+cx↦ (2c)+(2c)x $. That is, $ t $ has an eigenvalue of $ 2 $ associated with eigenvectors of the form $ c+cx $ where $ c ≠ 0 $.  This map also has an eigenvalue of $ 0 $ associated with eigenvectors of the form $ c-cx $ where $ c ≠ 0 $.   The definition above is for maps. We can give a matrix version.    A square matrix $ T $ has a scalar eigenvalue $ λ $ associated with the nonzero eigenvector $ vec(ζ) $ if $ Tvec(ζ)=λ·vec(ζ) $.    This extension of the definition for maps to a definition for matrices is natural but there is a point on which we must take care. The eigenvalues of a map are also the eigenvalues of matrices r epresenting that map, and so similar matrices have the same eigenvalues. However, the eigenvectors can differ- similar matrices need not have the same eigenvectors. The next example explains.  For example These matrices are similar $ T= ([ 2 0 0 0 ])  T̂ = ([ 4 -2 4 -2 ]) $ since $T̂=PTP^{-1}$ for this $P$. $ P= ([ 1 1 1 2 ])  P^{-1}= ([ 2 -1 -1 1 ]) $ The matrix $T$ has two eigenvalues, $λ_1=2$ and~$λ_2=0$. The first one is associated with this eigenvector. $ Tvec(e)_1= ([ 2 0 0 0 ]) [1 0] =[2 0] =2vec(e)_1 $ Suppose that $T$ represents a transformation $t: ℂ^2 → ℂ^2$ with respect to the standard basis. Then the action of this transformation $t$ is simple. $ [x y]t ↓[2x 0] $ Of course, $T̂$ represents the same transformation but with respect to a different basis~$B$. We can easily find this basis. The arrow diagram $  V_{wrt(\stdbasis_3)} → (T) V_{wrt(\stdbasis_3)} @V{I} VV @V{I} VV V_{wrt(B)} → (T̂) V_{wrt(B)}  $ shows that $P^{-1}=Representation of (I)$. By the definition of the matrix representation of a map, its first column is $rep{I(vec(β)_1)}{stdbasis(_3)}=rep{vec(β)_1}{stdbasis(_3)}$. With respect to the standard basis any vector is represented by itself, so the first basis element $vec(β)_1$ is the first column of $P^{-1}$. The same goes for the other one. $ B=sequence{[2 -1], [-1 1] } $ Since the matrices $T$ and~$T̂$ both represent the transformation~$t$, both reflect the action $t(vec(e)_1)=2vec(e)_1$. $ Representation of (t)·rep{vec(e)_1}{stdbasis(_2)} =T·rep{vec(e)_1}{stdbasis(_2)} =2·rep{vec(e)_1}{stdbasis(_2)} Representation of (t)·rep{vec(e)_1}{B} =T̂·rep{vec(e)_1}{B} =2·rep{vec(e)_1}{B} $ But while in those two equations the eigenvalue $2$'s are the same, the vector representations differ. $ T·rep{vec(e)_1}{stdbasis(_2)} =T[1 0] =2·[1 0] T̂·rep{vec(e)_1}{B} =T̂·[1 1] =2·[1 1] $ That is, when the matrix representing the transformation is $ T=Representation of (t) $ then it ``assumes'' that column vectors are representations with respect to $ stdbasis(_2) $. However $ T̂=Representation of (t) $ ``assumes'' that column vectors are representations with respect to $ B $, and so the column vectors that get doubled are different.                                                   We next see the basic tool for finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  For example If $ T= ([ 1 2 1 2 0 -2 -1 2 3 ]) $ then to find the scalars $ x $ such that $ Tvec(ζ)=xvec(ζ) $ for nonzero eigenvectors $ vec(ζ) $, bring everything to the left-hand side $ ([ 1 2 1 2 0 -2 -1 2 3 ]) [z_1 z_2 z_3] -x[z_1 z_2 z_3] =0 $ and factor $ (T-x I)vec(ζ)=0 $. (Note that it says $T-xI$. The expression $ T-x $ doesn't make sense because $ T $ is a matrix while $ x $ is a scalar.) This homogeneous linear system $ ([ 1-x 2 1 2 0-x -2 -1 2 3-x ]) [z_1 z_2 z_3] = [0 0 0] $ has a nonzero solution $vec(z)$ if and only if the matrix is singular. We can determine when that happens. $ 0 =determinant(T-x I) =([ 1-x 2 1 2 0-x -2 -1 2 3-x ]) =x^3-4x^2+4x =x(x-2)^2 $ The eigenvalues are $ λ_1=0 $ and $ λ_2=2 $. To find the associated eigenvectors plug in each eigenvalue. Plugging in $λ_1=0$ gives $ ([ 1-0 2 1 2 0-0 -2 -1 2 3-0 ]) [z_1 z_2 z_3] = [0 0 0] --> [z_1 z_2 z_3] = [a -a a] $ for $ a ≠ 0 $ ($ a $ must be non-$0$ because eigenvectors are defined to be non-$ 0 $). Plugging in $λ_2=2$ gives $ ([ 1-2 2 1 2 0-2 -2 -1 2 3-2 ]) [z_1 z_2 z_3] = [0 0 0] --> [z_1 z_2 z_3] = [b 0 b] $ with $ b ≠ 0 $.   For example If $ S= ([ π 1 0 3 ]) $ (here $ π $ is not a projection map, it is the number $ 3.14... $) then $ ([ π-x 1 0 3-x ]) = (x-π)(x-3) $ so $ S $ has eigenvalues of $ λ_1=π $ and $ λ_2=3 $. To find associated eigenvectors, first plug in $λ_1$ for $x$ $ ([ π-π 1 0 3-π ]) [z_1 z_2] = [0 0] --> [z_1 z_2] = [a 0] $ for a scalar $ a ≠ 0 $. Then plug in $λ_2$ $ ([ π-3 1 0 3-3 ]) [z_1 z_2] = [0 0] --> [z_1 z_2] = [-b/(π-3) b] $ where $ b ≠ 0 $.     The characteristic polynomial of a square matrix  $ T $ is the determinant $ determinant(T-x I) $ where $ x $ is a variable. The characteristic equation  is $determinant(T-xI)=0$. The characteristic polynomial of a transformation $ t $ is the characteristic polynomial of any matrix representation $ Representation of (t) $.      checks that the characteristic polynomial of a transformation is well-defined, that is, that the characteristic polynomial is the same no matter which basis we use for the representation.     A linear transformation on a nontrivial vector space has at least one eigenvalue.      Any root of the characteristic polynomial is an eigenvalue. Over the complex numbers, any polynomial of degree one or greater has a root.     That result is the reason that in this chapter we use scalars that are complex numbers.       The definend{eigenspace of a transformation~$t$ associated with the eigenvalue~$λ$} is $ V_{λ}={vec{{ζ} such that t(vec{{ζ})=λvec{{ζ}}  $. The eigenspace of a matrix is analogous.              An eigenspace is a subspace.      Fix an eigenvalue~$λ$. Notice first that $V_{λ}$ contains the zero vector since $t(0)=0$, which equals $λ0$. So the eigenspace is a nonempty subset of the space. What remains is to check closure of this set under linear combinations. Take $ vec(ζ)_1,...,vec(ζ)_n in V_{λ} $ and then verify $ t(Linear combination of c{vec(ζ)}) =c_1t(vec(ζ)_1)+...+c_nt(vec(ζ)_n) =c_1λvec(ζ)_1+...+c_nλvec(ζ)_n =λ(c_1vec(ζ)_1+...+c_nvec(ζ)_n) $ that the combination is also an element of $V_{λ}$.       For example In these are the eigenspaces associated with the eigenvalues $ 0 $ and $ 2 $. $ V_0={[a -a a] such that a in ℂ},  V_2={[b 0 b] such that b in ℂ}. $   For example In these are the eigenspaces associated with the eigenvalues $ π $ and~$ 3 $. $ V_{π}={[a 0] such that a in ℂ}  V_3={[-b/(π-3) b] such that b in ℂ} $   The characteristic equation in is $ 0=x(x-2)^2 $ so in some sense $ 2 $ is an eigenvalue twice. However there are not twice as many eigenvectors in that the dimension of the associated eigenspace $V_2$ is one, not two. The next example is a case where a number is a double root of the characteristic equation and the dimension of the associated eigenspace is two.  For example With respect to the standard bases, this matrix $ ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]) $ represents projection. $ [x y z] π ↓ [x y 0] x,y,z in ℂ $ Its characteristic equation $ 0 =determinant(T-x I) =([ 1-x 0 0 0 1-x 0 0 0 0-x ]) =(1-x)^2(0-x) $ has the double root~$x=1$ along with the single root~$x=0$. Its eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue $ 0 $ and its eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue $ 1 $ are easy to find. $ V_0={[0 0 c_3] such that c_3 in ℂ}  V_1={[c_1 c_2 0] such that c_1,c_2 in ℂ} $ Note that $V_1$ has dimension two.   By if two eigenvectors $vec(v)_1$ and $vec(v)_2$ are associated with the same eigenvalue then a linear combination of those two is also an eigenvector, associated with the same eigenvalue. As an illustration, referring to the prior example, this sum of two members of $V_1$ $ [1 0 0]+[0 1 0] $ yields another member of $V_1$.  The next result speaks to the situation where the vectors come from different eigenspaces.    For any set of distinct eigenvalues of a map or matrix, a set of associated eigenvectors, one per eigenvalue, is linearly independent.      We will use induction on the number of eigenvalues. The base step is that there are zero eigenvalues. Then the set of associated vectors is empty and so is linearly independent.        For the inductive step assume that the statement is true for any set of $ k≥ 0 $ distinct eigenvalues. Consider distinct eigenvalues $ λ_1,...,λ_{k+1} $ and let $ vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_{k+1} $ be associated eigenvectors. Suppose that $0=c_1vec(v)_1+...+c_kvec(v)_k+c_{k+1}vec(v)_{k+1}$. Derive two equations from that, the first by multiplying by $ λ_{k+1} $ on both sides $0=c_1λ_{k+1}vec(v)_1+...+c_{k+1}λ_{k+1}vec(v)_{k+1}$ and the second by applying the map to both sides $0=c_1t(vec(v)_1)+...+c_{k+1}t(vec(v)_{k+1}) =c_1λ_1vec(v)_1+...+c_{k+1}λ_{k+1}vec(v)_{k+1}$ (applying the matrix gives the same result). Subtract the second from the first. $ 0= c_1(λ_{k+1}-λ_1)vec(v)_1+... +c_k(λ_{k+1}-λ_k)vec(v)_k +c_{k+1}(λ_{k+1}-λ_{k+1})vec(v)_{k+1} $ The $vec(v)_{k+1}$ term vanishes. Then the induction hypothesis gives that $ c_1(λ_{k+1}-λ_1)=0 $, ..., $ c_k(λ_{k+1}-λ_k)=0 $. The eigenvalues are distinct so the coefficients $ c_1,...,c_k $ are all~$ 0 $. With that we are left with the equation $ 0=c_{k+1}vec(v)_{k+1} $ so $ c_{k+1} $ is also~$ 0 $.    For example The eigenvalues of $ ([ 2 -2 2 0 1 1 -4 8 3 ]) $ are distinct: $ λ_1=1 $, $ λ_2=2 $, and~$ λ_3=3 $. A set of associated eigenvectors $ { [2 1 0], [9 4 4], [2 1 2] } $ is linearly independent.     An $ N by N $ matrix with $ n $ distinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable.      Form a basis of eigenvectors. Apply .    This section observes that some matrices are similar to a diagonal matrix. The idea of eigenvalues arose as the entries of that diagonal matrix, although the definition applies more broadly than just to diagonalizable matrices. To find eigenvalues we defined the characteristic equation and that led to the final result, a criteria for diagonalizability. (While it is useful for the theory, note that in applications finding eigenvalues this way is typically impractical; for one thing the matrix may be large and finding roots of large-degree polynomials is hard.)  In the next section we study matrices that cannot be diagonalized.     For each, find the characteristic polynomial and the eigenvalues.  $ ([ 10 -9 4 -2 ]) $ $([ 1 2 4 3 ])$ $ ([ 0 3 7 0 ]) $ $ ([ 0 0 0 0 ]) $ $ ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) $    This $ 0= ([ 10-x -9 4 -2-x ]) =(10-x)(-2-x)-(-36) $ simplifies to the characteristic equation $ x^2-8x+16=0 $. Because the equation factors into $(x-4)^2$ there is only one eigenvalue $ λ_1=4 $. $0=(1-x)(3-x)-8=x^2-4x-5$; $λ_1=5$, $λ_2=-1$ $ x^2-21=0 $; $ λ_1=√{21} $, $λ_2=-√{21}$ $ x^2=0 $; $ λ_1=0 $ $ x^2-2x+1=0 $; $ λ_1=1 $    For each matrix, find the characteristic equation, and the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors.  $ ([ 3 0 8 -1 ]) $ $ ([ 3 2 -1 0 ]) $    The characteristic equation is $ (3-x)(-1-x)=0 $. Its roots, the eigenvalues, are $ λ_1=3 $ and $ λ_2=-1 $. For the eigenvectors we consider this equation. $ ([ 3-x 0 8 -1-x ]) [b_1 b_2] =[0 0] $ For the eigenvector associated with $λ_1=3$, we consider the resulting linear system. $ $ 0· b_1 + 0· b_2 = 0 8· b_1 + -4· b_2 = 0 $ $ The eigenspace is the set of vectors whose second component is twice the first component. $ {[b_2/2 b_2] such that b_2 in ℂ}  ([ 3 0 8 -1 ]) [b_2/2 b_2] =3·[b_2/2 b_2] $ (Here, the parameter is $b_2$ only because that is the variable that is free in the above system.) Hence, this is an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue $3$. $ [1 2] $  Finding an eigenvector associated with $λ_2=-1$ is similar. This system $ $ 4· b_1 + 0· b_2 = 0 8· b_1 + 0· b_2 = 0 $ $ leads to the set of vectors whose first component is zero. $ {[0 b_2] such that b_2 in ℂ}  ([ 3 0 8 -1 ]) [0 b_2] =-1·[0 b_2] $ And so this is an eigenvector associated with $λ_2$. $ [0 1] $ The characteristic equation is $ 0= ([ 3-x 2 -1 -x ]) =x^2-3x+2=(x-2)(x-1) $ and so the eigenvalues are $λ_1=2$ and $λ_2=1$. To find eigenvectors, consider this system. $ $ (3-x)· b_1 + 2· b_2 = 0 -1· b_1 - x· b_2 = 0 $ $ For $λ_1=2$ we get $ $ 1· b_1 + 2· b_2 = 0 -1· b_1 - 2· b_2 = 0 $ $ leading to this eigenspace and eigenvector. $ {[-2b_2 b_2] such that b_2 in ℂ}  [-2 1] $ For $λ_2=1$ the system is $ $ 2· b_1 + 2· b_2 = 0 -1· b_1 - 1· b_2 = 0 $ $ leading to this. $ {[-b_2 b_2] such that b_2 in ℂ}  [-1 1] $    Find the characteristic equation, and the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors for this matrix. Hint. The eigenvalues are complex. $ ([ -2 -1 5 2 ]) $  The characteristic equation $ 0= ([ -2-x -1 5 2-x ]) =x^2+1 $ has the complex roots $λ_1=i$ and $λ_2=-i$. This system $ $ (-2-x)· b_1 - 1· b_2 = 0 5· b_1 (2-x)· b_2 = 0 $ $ For $λ_1=i$ Gauss's Method gives this reduction. $ $ (-2-i)· b_1 - 1· b_2 = 0 5· b_1 - (2-i)· b_2 = 0 $ for step $(-5/(-2-i))ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ (-2-i)· b_1 - 1· b_2 = 0 0 = 0 $ $ (For the calculation in the lower right get a common denominator $ (5/-2-i)-(2-i) = (5/-2-i)-(-2-i/-2-i)· (2-i) = (5-(-5)/-2-i) $ to see that it gives a $0=0$ equation.) These are the resulting eigenspace and eigenvector. $ {[(1/(-2-i))b_2 b_2] such that b_2 in ℂ}  [1/(-2-i) 1] $ For $λ_2=-i$ the system $ $ (-2+i)· b_1 - 1· b_2 = 0 5· b_1 - (2+i)· b_2 = 0 $ for step $(-5/(-2+i))ρ_1+ρ_2$ $ (-2+i)· b_1 - 1· b_2 = 0 0 = 0 $ $ leads to this. $ {[(1/(-2+i))b_2 b_2] such that b_2 in ℂ}  [1/(-2+i) 1] $   Find the characteristic polynomial, the eigenvalues, and the associated eigenvectors of this matrix. $ ([ 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]) $  The characteristic equation is $ 0= ([ 1-x 1 1 0 -x 1 0 0 1-x ]) =(1-x)^2(-x) $ and so the eigenvalues are $λ_1=1$ (this is a repeated root of the equation) and $λ_2=0$.

Fix the natural basis $B=1,x,x^2,x^3$. The map's action is $1↦ 0$, $x↦ 1$, $x^2↦ 2x$, and $x^3↦ 3x^2$ and its representation is easy to compute. $ T=Representation of (d/dx)= ([ 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 ])_{B,B} $ We find the eigenvalues with this computation. $ 0=determinant(T-xI)= ([ -x 1 0 0 0 -x 2 0 0 0 -x 3 0 0 0 -x ]) =x^4 $ Thus the map has the single eigenvalue $λ=0$.

The determinant of the triangular matrix $T-xI$ is the product down the diagonal, and so it factors into the product of the terms $t_{i,i}-x$.   Find the formula for the characteristic polynomial of a $N by N$ matrix.  Just expand the determinant of $T-xI$. $ ([ a-x c b d-x ]) =(a-x)(d-x)-bc =x^2+(-a-d)· x +(ad-bc) $   Prove that the characteristic polynomial of a transformation is well-defined.  Any two representations of that transformation are similar, and similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.  Prove or disprove: if all the eigenvalues of a matrix are $0$ then it must be the zero matrix.  It is not true. All of the eigenvalues of this matrix are $0$. $ ([ 0 1 0 0 ]) $    Show that any non-$ 0 $ vector in any nontrivial vector space can be a eigenvector. That is, given a $ vec(v) ≠0 $ from a nontrivial $ V $, show that there is a transformation $ t: V → V $ having a scalar eigenvalue $ λ in ℝ $ such that $ vec(v) in V_{λ} $. What if we are given a scalar $ λ $? Can any non-$ 0 $ member of any nontrivial vector space be an eigenvector associated with $ λ $?    Use $ λ=1 $ and the identity map. Yes, use the transformation that multiplies all vectors by the scalar $ λ $.    Suppose that $ t: V → V $ and $ T=Representation of (t) $. Prove that the eigenvectors of $ T $ associated with $ λ $ are the non-$ 0 $ vectors in the kernel of the map represented (with respect to the same bases) by $ T-λ I $.  If $t(vec(v))=λ·vec(v)$ then $vec(v)↦0$ under the map $t-λ·I$.   Prove that if $a,...,d$ are all integers and $ a+b=c+d $ then $ ([ a b c d ]) $ has integral eigenvalues, namely $ a+b $ and $ a-c $.  The characteristic equation $ 0= ([ a-x b c d-x ]) =(a-x)(d-x)-bc $ simplifies to $x^2+(-a-d)· x + (ad-bc)$. Checking that the values $x=a+b$ and $x=a-c$ satisfy the equation (under the $a+b=c+d$ condition) is routine.   Prove that if $ T $ is nonsingular and has eigenvalues $ λ_1,...,λ_n $ then $ T^{-1} $ has eigenvalues $ 1/λ_1,...,1/λ_n $. Is the converse true?  Consider an eigenspace $V_{λ}$. Any $vec(w) in V_{λ}$ is the image $vec(w)=λ·vec(v)$ of some $vec(v) in V_{λ}$ (namely, $vec(v)=(1/λ)·vec(w)$). Thus, on $V_{λ}$ (which is a nontrivial subspace) the action of $t^{-1}$ is $t^{-1}(vec(w))=vec(v)=(1/λ)·vec(w)$, and so $1/λ$ is an eigenvalue of $t^{-1}$.   Suppose that $ T $ is $ N by N $ and $ c,d $ are scalars.  Prove that if $ T $ has the eigenvalue $ λ $ with an associated eigenvector $ vec(v) $ then $ vec(v) $ is an eigenvector of $ cT+dI $ associated with eigenvalue $ cλ+d $. Prove that if $ T $ is diagonalizable then so is $ cT+dI $.    We have $(cT+dI)vec(v)=cTvec(v)+dIvec(v)=cλvec(v)+dvec(v) =(cλ+d)· vec(v)$. Suppose that $S=PTP^{-1}$ is diagonal. Then $P(cT+dI)P^{-1}=P(cT)P^{-1}+P(dI)P^{-1} =cPTP^{-1}+dI=cS+dI$ is also diagonal.    Show that $ λ $ is an eigenvalue of $ T $ if and only if the map represented by $ T-λ I $ is not an isomorphism.  The scalar $λ$ is an eigenvalue if and only if the transformation $t-λ I$ is singular. A transformation is singular if and only if it is not an isomorphism (that is, a transformation is an isomorphism if and only if it is nonsingular).    Show that if $ λ $ is an eigenvalue of $ A $ then $ λ^k $ is an eigenvalue of $ A^k $. What is wrong with this proof generalizing that? ``If $ λ $ is an eigenvalue of $ A $ and $ μ $ is an eigenvalue for $ B $, then $ λμ $ is an eigenvalue for $ AB $, for, if $ Avec(x)=λvec(x) $ and $ Bvec(x)=μvec(x) $ then $ ABvec(x)=Aμvec(x)=μ Avec(x)=μλvec(x) $''?    Where the eigenvalue $λ$ is associated with the eigenvector $vec(x)$ then $A^kvec(x)=A·s Avec(x)=A^{k-1}λvec(x) =λ A^{k-1}vec(x)=·s=λ^kvec(x)$. (The full details require induction on $k$.) The eigenvector associated with $λ$ might not be an eigenvector associated with $μ$.    Do matrix equivalent matrices have the same eigenvalues?  No. These are two same-sized, equal rank, matrices with different eigenvalues. $ ([ 1 0 0 1 ])  ([ 1 0 0 2 ]) $   Show that a square matrix with real entries and an odd number of rows has at least one real eigenvalue.  The characteristic polynomial has an odd power and so has at least one real root.   Diagonalize. $ ([ -1 2 2 2 2 2 -3 -6 -6 ]) $  The characteristic polynomial $x^3+5x^2+6x$ has distinct roots $ λ_1=0 $, $ λ_2=-2 $, and $ λ_3=-3 $. Thus the matrix can be diagonalized into this form. $ ([ 0 0 0 0 -2 0 0 0 -3 ]) $   Suppose that $ P $ is a nonsingular $ N by N $ matrix. Show that the similarity transformation map $ map(t_P){matspace(_){N by N}}{matspace(_){N by N}} $ sending $ T↦ PTP^{-1} $ is an isomorphism.  We must show that it is one-to-one and onto, and that it respects the operations of matrix addition and scalar multiplication.  To show that it is one-to-one, suppose that $t_P(T)=t_P(S)$, that is, suppose that $PTP^{-1}=PSP^{-1}$, and note that multiplying both sides on the left by $P^{-1}$ and on the right by $P$ gives that $T=S$. To show that it is onto, consider $S inmatspace(_){N by N}$ and observe that $S=t_P(P^{-1}SP)$.  The map $t_P$ preserves matrix addition since $t_P(T+S)=P(T+S)P^{-1}=(PT+PS)P^{-1}=PTP^{-1}+PSP^{-1}=t_P(T+S)$ follows from properties of matrix multiplication and addition that we have seen. Scalar multiplication is similar:~$t_P(cT)=P(c· T)P^{-1}=c· (PTP^{-1})=c· t_P(T)$.    Show that if $ A $ is an $ n $ square matrix and each row (column) sums to $ c $ then $ c $ is a characteristic root of $ A $. (``Characteristic root'' is a synonym for eigenvalue.)   If the argument of the characteristic function of $ A $ is set equal to $ c $, adding the first $ (n-1) $ rows (columns) to the $ n $th row (column) yields a determinant whose $ n $th row (column) is zero. Thus $ c $ is a characteristic root of $ A $.          This chapter shows that every square matrix is similar to one that is a sum of two kinds of simple matrices. The prior section focused on the first simple kind, diagonal matrices. We now consider the other kind.              Because a linear transformation $t: V → V$ has the same domain as codomain, we can compose $t$ with itself $ t^2=∘{t}{t} $, and $ t^3=∘{t}{∘{t}{t}} $, etc.spacefactor=1000    Note that the superscript power notation $t^j$ for iterates of the transformations fits with the notation that we've used for their square matrix representations because if $Representation of (t)=T$ then $ Representation of (t^j)=T^j $.   For example For the derivative map $ d/dx: polyspace(_3) → polyspace(_3) $ given by $ a+bx+cx^2+dx^3xmapsunder(d/dx) b+2cx+3dx^2 $ the second power is the second derivative $ a+bx+cx^2+dx^3xmapsunder(d^2/dx^2) 2c+6dx $ the third power is the third derivative $ a+bx+cx^2+dx^3xmapsunder(d^3/dx^3) 6d $ and any higher power is the zero map.   For example This transformation of the space $matspace(_){N by N}$ of $N by N$ matrices $ ([ a b c d ]) t ↓ ([ b a d 0 ]) $ has this second power $ ([ a b c d ]) t^2 ↓ ([ a b 0 0 ]) $ and this third power. $ ([ a b c d ]) t^3 ↓ ([ b a 0 0 ]) $ After that, $t^4=t^2$ and $t^5=t^3$, etc.   For example Consider the shift transformation $t: ℂ^3 → ℂ^3$. $ [x y z] t ↓ [0 x y] $ We have that $ [x y z] t ↓ [0 x y] t ↓ [0 0 x] t ↓ [0 0 0] $ so the range spaces descend to the trivial subspace. $ t={[0 a b] such that a,b in ℂ}  t^2={[0 0 c] such that c in ℂ}  t^3={[0 0 0]} $   These examples suggest that after some number of iterations the map settles down.   For any transformation $ t: V → V $, the range spaces of the powers form a descending chain $ V⊇ t⊇t^2⊇·s $ and the null spaces form an ascending chain. $ {vec{{0}}⊆νllspace{t}⊆νllspace{t^2}⊆·s $ Further, there is a $ k $ such that for powers less than $k$ the subsets are proper so that if $j<k$ then $t^jsupsetrangespace{t^{j+1}}$ and $νllspace{t^j}⊆νllspace{t^{j+1}}$, while for higher powers the sets are equal so that if $j≥ k$ then $t^j=rangespace{t^{j+1}}$ and $νllspace{t^j}=νllspace{t^{j+1}}$).    First recall that for any map the dimension of its range space plus the dimension of its null space equals the dimension of its domain. So if the dimensions of the range spaces shrink then the dimensions of the null spaces must rise. We will do the range space half here and leave the rest for .  We start by showing that the range spaces form a chain. If $vec(w) inrangespace{t^{j+1}}$, so that $vec(w)=t^{j+1}(vec(v))$ for some $vec(v)$, then $vec(w)=t^{j}(t(vec(v)))$. Thus $vec(w) inrangespace{t^{j}}$.  Next we verify the ``further'' property: in the chain the subsets containments are proper initially, and then from some power $k$ onward the range spaces are equal. We first show that if any pair of adjacent range spaces in the chain are equal $ rangespace{t^{k}}=rangespace{t^{k+1}} $ then all subsequent ones are also equal $ rangespace{t^{k+1}}=rangespace{t^{k+2}} $, etc. This holds because $ map(t){rangespace{t^{k+1}}}{rangespace{t^{k+2}}} $ is the same map, with the same domain, as $ map(t){rangespace{t^{k}}}{rangespace{t^{k+1}}} $ and it therefore has the same range $ rangespace{t^{k+1}}=rangespace{t^{k+2}} $ (it holds for all higher powers by induction). So if the chain of range spaces ever stops strictly decreasing then from that point onward it is stable.  We end by showing that the chain must eventually stop decreasing. Each range space is a subspace of the one before it. For it to be a proper subspace it must be of strictly lower dimension (see ). These spaces are finite-dimensional and so the chain can fall for only finitely many steps. That is, the power $k$ is at most the dimension of $V$.   For example The derivative map $a+bx+cx^2+dx^3xmapsunder(d/dx) b+2cx+3dx^2$ on $polyspace(_3)$ has this chain of range spaces $ t^0=polyspace(_3) \:supset\:t^1=polyspace(_2) \:supset\:t^2=polyspace(_1) \:supset\:t^3=polyspace(_0) \:supset\:t^4={0}   $ (all later elements of the chain are the trivial space). And it has this chain of null spaces $ νllspace{t^0}={0} \:⊆\: νllspace{t^1}=polyspace(_0) \:⊆\:νllspace{t^2}=polyspace(_1) \:⊆\:νllspace{t^3}=polyspace(_2) \:⊆\:νllspace{t^4}=polyspace(_3) $ (later elements are the entire space).   For example Let $ t: polyspace(_2) → polyspace(_2) $ be the map $ c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2 ↦ 2c_0+c_2x. $ As the lemma describes, on iteration the range space shrinks $ t^0=polyspace(_2)  t={a+bx such that a,b in ℂ}  t^2={a such that a in ℂ} $ and then stabilizes $t^2=t^3=·s$ while the null space grows $ νllspace{t^0}={0}  νllspace{t}={cx such that c in ℂ}  νllspace{t^2}={cx+d such that c,d in ℂ} $ and then stabilizes $νllspace{t^2}=νllspace{t^3}=·s$.   For example The transformation $ π: ℂ^3 → ℂ^3 $ projecting onto the first two coordinates $ [c_1 c_2 c_3] π ↓ [c_1 c_2 0] $ has $ ℂ^3supset(π)=π^2=·s $ and $ {0}⊆νllspace{π}=νllspace{π^2}=·s $ where this is the range space and the null space. $ π={[a b 0] such that a,b in ℂ}  νllspace{π}={[0 0 c] such that c in ℂ} $    Let $ t $ be a transformation on an $ n $-dimensional space. The generalized range space  (or closure of the range space ) is $general rangespace(t)=t^n$. The generalized null space  (or closure of the null space ) is $general nullspace(t)=νllspace{t^n}$.   This graph illustrates. The horizontal axis gives the power~$j$ of a transformation. The vertical axis gives the dimension of the range space of $t^j$ as the distance above zero, and thus also shows the dimension of the null space because the two add to the dimension $n$ of the domain.     On iteration the rank falls and the nullity rises until there is some $k$ such that the map reaches a steady state $t^k=rangespace{t^{k+1}}=general rangespace(t)$ and $νllspace{t^k}=νllspace{t^{k+1}}=general nullspace(t)$. This must happen by the $n$-th iterate.        Give the chains of range spaces and null spaces for the zero and identity transformations.  For the zero transformation, no matter what the space, the chain of range spaces is $ Vsupset{vec{{0}}={vec{{0}}=·s $ and the chain of null spaces is $ {vec{{0}}⊆ V=V=·s $. For the identity transformation the chains are $ V=V=V=·s $ and $ {vec{{0}}={vec{{0}}=·s $.   For each map, give the chain of range spaces and the chain of null spaces, and the generalized range space and the generalized null space.  $t_0: polyspace(_2) → polyspace(_2)$, $a+bx+cx^2↦ b+cx^2$ $t_1: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2$, $ [a b]↦[0 a] $ $t_2: polyspace(_2) → polyspace(_2)$, $a+bx+cx^2↦ b+cx+ax^2$ $t_3: ℝ^3 → ℝ^3$, $ [a b c]↦[a a b] $    Iterating $t_0$ twice $a+bx+cx^2↦ b+cx^2↦ cx^2$ gives $ a+bx+cx^2t_0^2 ↓cx^2 $ and any higher power is the same map. Thus, while $t_0$ is the space of quadratic polynomials with no linear term ${p+rx^2 such that p,r in ℂ}$, and $t_0^2$ is the space of purely-quadratic polynomials ${rx^2 such that r in ℂ}$, this is where the chain stabilizes $general rangespace(t_0)={rx^2 such that n in ℂ}$. As for null spaces, $νllspace{t_0}$ is the space of purely-linear quadratic polynomials ${qx such that q in ℂ}$, and $νllspace{t_0^2}$ is the space of quadratic polynomials with no $x^2$ term ${p+qx such that p,q in ℂ}$, and this is the end $general nullspace(t_0)=νllspace{t_0^2}$. The second power $ [a b] t_1 ↓[0 a] t_1 ↓[0 0] $ is the zero map. Consequently, the chain of range spaces $ ℝ^2 supset([0 p] such that p in ℂ) supset(0) =·s $ and the chain of null spaces $ {0} ⊆{[q 0] such that q in ℂ} ⊆ ℝ^2 =·s $ each has length two. The generalized range space is the trivial subspace and the generalized null space is the entire space. Iterates of this map cycle around $ a+bx+cx^2 t_2 ↓ b+cx+ax^2 t_2 ↓ c+ax+bx^2 t_2 ↓ a+bx+cx^2 ·s $ and the chains of range spaces and null spaces are trivial. $ polyspace(_2)=polyspace(_2)=·s  {0}={0}=·s $ Thus, obviously, generalized spaces are $general rangespace(t_2)=polyspace(_2)$ and $general nullspace(t_2)={0}$. We have $ [a b c] ↦[a a b] ↦[a a a] ↦[a a a] ↦·s $ and so the chain of range spaces $ ℝ^3 supset([p p r] such that p,r in ℂ) supset([p p p] such that p in ℂ) =·s $ and the chain of null spaces $ {0} ⊆{[0 0 r] such that r in ℂ} ⊆{[0 q r] such that q,r in ℂ} =·s $ each has length two. The generalized spaces are the final ones shown above in each chain.    Prove that function composition is associative $ ∘{(∘{t}{t})}{t}=∘{t}{(∘{t}{t})} $ and so we can write $t^3$ without specifying a grouping.  Each maps $ x↦ t(t(t(x))) $.   Check that a subspace must be of dimension less than or equal to the dimension of its superspace. Check that if the subspace is proper (the subspace does not equal the superspace) then the dimension is strictly less. textit{(This is used in the proof of .)}  Recall that if $W$ is a subspace of $V$ then we can enlarge any basis $B_W$ for $W$ to make a basis $B_V$ for $V$. From this the first sentence is immediate. The second sentence is also not hard:~$W$ is the span of $B_W$ and if $W$ is a proper subspace then $V$ is not the span of $B_W$, and so $B_V$ must have at least one vector more than does $B_W$.   Prove that the generalized range space $general rangespace(t)$ is the entire space, and the generalized null space $general nullspace(t)$ is trivial, if the transformation $t$ is nonsingular. Is this `only if' also?  It is both `if' and `only if'. A linear map is nonsingular if and only if it preserves dimension, that is, if the dimension of its range equals the dimension of its domain. With a transformation $t: V → V$ that means that the map is nonsingular if and only if it is onto: $t=V$ (and thus $t^2=V$, etc).   Verify the null space half of .  The null spaces form chains because because if $vec(v) inνllspace{t^j}$ then $t^j(vec(v))=0$ and $t^{j+1}(vec(v))=t(t^j(vec(v)))=t(0)=0$ and so $vec(v) inνllspace{t^{j+1}}$.  Now, the ``further'' property for null spaces follows from that fact that it holds for range spaces, along with the prior exercise. Because the dimension of $t^j$ plus the dimension of $νllspace{t^j}$ equals the dimension~$n$ of the starting space~$V$, when the dimensions of the range spaces stop decreasing, so do the dimensions of the null spaces. The prior exercise shows that from this point~$k$ on, the containments in the chain are not proper- the null spaces are equal.   Give an example of a transformation on a three dimensional space whose range has dimension two. What is its null space? Iterate your example until the range space and null space stabilize.  (Many examples are correct but here is one.) An example is the shift operator on triples of reals $ (x,y,z)↦ (0,x,y) $. The null space is all triples that start with two zeros. The map stabilizes after three iterations.   Show that the range space and null space of a linear transformation need not be disjoint. Are they ever disjoint?  The differentiation operator $ d/dx: polyspace(_1) → polyspace(_1) $ has the same range space as null space. For an example of where they are disjoint- except for the zero vector- consider an identity map, or any nonsingular map.                      textit{This requires material from the optional Combining Subspaces subsection.}  The prior subsection shows that as $ j $ increases the dimensions of the $t^j$'s fall while the dimensions of the $νllspace{t^j}$'s rise, in such a way that this rank and nullity split between them the dimension of $V$. Can we say more; do the two split a basis- is $ V=t^j⊕νllspace{t^j} $?  The answer is yes for the smallest power $j=0$ since $ V=t^0⊕νllspace{t^0}=V⊕{0} $. The answer is also yes at the other extreme.   For any linear $ t: V → V $ the function $ map(t){general rangespace(t)}{general rangespace(t)} $ is one-to-one.    Let the dimension of $V$ be $n$. Because $ t^n=rangespace{t^{n+1}} $, the map $ map(t){general rangespace(t)}{general rangespace(t)} $ is a dimension-preserving homomorphism. Therefore, by Theorem~Two.II. it is one-to-one.    Where $ t: V → V $ is a linear transformation, the space is the direct sum $ V=general rangespace(t)⊕general nullspace(t) $. That is, both (1)~$ dim(V)=dim(general rangespace(t))+dim(general nullspace(t)) $ and (2)~$ general rangespace(t) intersectiongeneral nullspace(t)={0} $.    Let the dimension of $V$ be $n$. We will verify the second sentence, which is equivalent to the first. Clause~(1) is true because any transformation satisfies that its rank plus its nullity equals the dimension of the space, and in particular this holds for the transformation $t^n$.  For clause~(2), assume that $ vec(v) ingeneral rangespace(t) intersectiongeneral nullspace(t) $  to prove that $vec(v)=0$. Because $ vec(v) $ is in the generalized null space, $ t^n(vec(v))=0 $. On the other hand, by the lemma $ map(t){general rangespace(t)}{general rangespace(t)} $ is one-to-one and a composition of one-to-one maps is one-to-one, so $ map(t^n){general rangespace(t)}{general rangespace(t)} $ is one-to-one. Only $ 0 $ is sent by a one-to-one linear map to $ 0 $ so the fact that $ t^n(vec(v))=0 $ implies that $ vec(v)=0 $.    Technically there is a difference between the map $t: V → V$ and the map on the subspace $ map(t){general rangespace(t)}{general rangespace(t)} $ if the generalized range space is not equal to $V$, because the domains are different. But the difference is small because the second is the restriction of the first to $general rangespace(t)$.   For powers between $j=0$ and~$j=n$, the space $V$ might not be the direct sum of $t^j$ and $νllspace{t^j}$. The next example shows that the two can have a nontrivial intersection.  For example Consider the transformation of $ ℂ^2 $ defined by this action on the elements of the standard basis. $ [1 0] n ↓ [0 1]  [0 1] n ↓ [0 0]  N=Representation of (n)=([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $ This is a shift map and is clearly nilpotent of index two. $ [x y]↦ [0 x] $ Another way to depict this map's action is with a string. $  vec(e)_1 ↦ vec(e)_2 ↦ 0  $ The vector $ vec(e)_2=[0 1] $ is in both the range space and null space.   For example A map $ map(n̂){ ℂ^4}{ ℂ^4} $ whose action on $ stdbasis(_4) $ is given by the string $  vec(e)_1 ↦ vec(e)_2 ↦ vec(e)_3 ↦ vec(e)_4 ↦ 0  $ has $ rangespace(n̂) intersectionνllspace{n̂} $ equal to the span $ span({vec{{e)_4}} $, has $ rangespace(n̂^2) intersectionνllspace{n̂^2}= span({vec{{e)_3,vec{{e}_4}} $, and has $ rangespace(n̂^3) intersectionνllspace{n̂^3}= span({vec{{e)_4}} $. It is nilpotent of index four. The matrix representation is all zeros except for some subdiagonal ones. $ N̂=rep(n̂){stdbasis(_4),stdbasis(_4)} =([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 \ ]) $   For example Transformations can act via more than one string. A transformation $ t $ acting on a basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_5} $ by $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ vec(β)_3 ↦ 0 vec(β)_4 ↦ vec(β)_5 ↦ 0  $ is represented by a matrix that is all zeros except for blocks of subdiagonal ones $ Representation of (t)= ([ 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $ (the lines just visually organize the blocks).   In those examples all vectors are eventually transformed to zero.   A nilpotent transformation  is one with a power that is the zero map. A nilpotent matrix  is one with a power that is the zero matrix. In either case, the least such power is the index of nilpotency.    For example In the index of nilpotency is two. In it is four. In it is three.   For example The differentiation map $ d/dx: polyspace(_2) → polyspace(_2) $ is nilpotent of index three since the third derivative of any quadratic polynomial is zero. This map's action is described by the string $x^2↦ 2x↦ 2↦ 0$ and taking the basis $ B=x^2,2x,2 $ gives this representation. $ Representation of (d/dx)= ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $   Not all nilpotent matrices are all zeros except for blocks of subdiagonal ones.  For example With the matrix $N̂$ from , and this four-vector basis $ D=sequence{[1 0 1 0], [0 2 1 0], [1 1 1 0], [0 0 0 1]} $ a change of basis operation produces this representation with respect to $ D,D $. $ ([ 1 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ]) ([ 1 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ])^{-1} = ([ -1 0 1 0 -3 -2 5 0 -2 -1 3 0 2 1 -2 0 ]) $ The new matrix is nilpotent; its fourth power is the zero matrix. We could verify this with a tedious computation or we can instead just observe that it is nilpotent since its fourth power is similar to $ N̂^4 $, the zero matrix, and the only matrix similar to the zero matrix is itself. $ (PN̂P^{-1})^4 =PN̂P^{-1}· PN̂P^{-1}· PN̂P^{-1}· PN̂P^{-1} =PN̂^4P^{-1} $   The goal of this subsection is to show that the prior example is prototypical in that every nilpotent matrix is similar to one that is all zeros except for blocks of subdiagonal ones.   Let $ t $ be a nilpotent transformation on $ V $. A definend{$ t $-string of length $k$ generated by $ vec(v) in V $} is a sequence $ sequence{vec(v),t(vec(v)),...,t^{k-1}(vec(v))} $. A $ t $-string basis is a basis that is a concatenation of $ t $-strings.   For example Consider differentiation $ d/dx: polyspace(_2) → polyspace(_2) $. The sequence $ x^2, 2x, 2, 0 $ is a $ d/dx $-string of length~$ 4 $. The sequence $ x^2, 2x, 2 $ is a $ d/dx $-string of length~$ 3 $ that is a basis for $ polyspace(_2)$.   Note that the strings cannot form a basis under concatenation if they are not disjoint because a basis cannot have a repeated vector.  For example In , we can concatenate the $t$-strings $sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2,vec(β)_3}$ and $sequence{vec(β)_4,vec(β)_5}$ to make a basis for the domain of $t$.    If a space has a $ t $-string basis then the index of nilpotency of $t$ is the length of the longest string in that basis.    Let the space have a basis of $t$-strings and let $t$'s index of nilpotency be~$k$. We cannot have that the longest string in that basis is longer than $t$'s index of nilpotency because $ t^k $ sends any vector, including the vector starting the longest string, to $ 0 $. Therefore instead suppose that the space has a $t$-string basis~$B$ where all of the strings are shorter than length~$ k $. Because $t$ has index~$k$, there is a vector $ vec(v) $ such that $ t^{k-1}(vec(v)) ≠0 $. Represent $vec(v)$ as a linear combination of elements from~$B$ and apply $ t^{k-1} $. We are supposing that $ t^{k-1} $ maps each element of~$B$ to $ 0 $, and therefore maps each term in the linear combination to $0$, but also that it does not map $ vec(v) $ to $ 0 $. That is a contradiction.   We shall show that each nilpotent map has an associated string basis, a basis of disjoint strings.      To see the main idea of the argument, imagine that we want to construct a counterexample, a map that is nilpotent but without an associated disjoint string basis. We might think to make something like the map $ t: ℂ^5 → ℂ^5 $ with this action.  {1in} setlength(\unitlength){1pt} $      put(0,8){{$↦$}} put(0,-8){{$↦$}}  vec(e)_3 ↦ 0 [4ex] vec(e)_4 ↦ vec(e)_5 ↦ 0 $   $Representation of (t)= ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ])$  But, the fact that the shown basis isn't disjoint doesn't mean that there isn't another basis that consists of disjoint strings.  To produce such a basis for this map we will first find the number and lengths of its strings. Observer that $t$'s index of nilpotency is two. says that at least one string in a disjoint string basis has length two. There are five basis elements so if there is a disjoint string basis then the map must act in one of these ways. $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ 0 vec(β)_3 ↦ vec(β)_4 ↦ 0 vec(β)_5 ↦ 0    vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ 0 vec(β)_3 ↦ 0 vec(β)_4 ↦ 0 vec(β)_5 ↦ 0  $ Now, the key point. A transformation with the left-hand action has a null space of dimension three since that's how many basis vectors are mapped to zero. A transformation with the right-hand action has a null space of dimension four. Wit the matrix representation above we can determine which of the two possible shapes is right. $ νllspace{t}= {[x -x z 0 r] such that x,z,r in ℂ } $ This is three-dimensional, meaning that of the two disjoint string basis forms above, $ t $'s basis has the left-hand one.  To produce a string basis for~$t$, first pick $ vec(β)_2 $ and $ vec(β)_4 $ from $ t intersectionνllspace{t} $. $ vec(β)_2=[0 0 1 0 0] vec(β)_4=[0 0 0 0 1] $ (Other choices are possible, just be sure that the set $ {vec{{β}_2,vec{{β}_4} $ is linearly independent.) For $ vec(β)_5 $ pick a vector from $ νllspace{t} $ that is not in the span of $ { vec{{β}_2,vec{{β}_4 } $. $ vec(β)_5=[1 -1 0 0 0] $ Finally, take $ vec(β)_1 $ and $ vec(β)_3 $ such that $ t(vec(β)_1)=vec(β)_2 $ and $ t(vec(β)_3)=vec(β)_4 $. $ vec(β)_1=[0 1 0 0 0] vec(β)_3=[0 0 0 1 0] $ Therefore, we have a string basis $ B=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_5} $ and with respect to that basis the matrix of $t$ has blocks of subdiagonal~$1$'s. $ Representation of (t)= ([ 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $    Any nilpotent transformation $t$ is associated with a $ t $-string basis. While the basis is not unique, the number and the length of the strings is determined by $ t $.   This illustrates the proof, which describes three kinds of basis vectors (shown in squares if they are in the null space and in circles if they are not). $  ③ ↦ ① ↦ ·s ·s ↦ ① ↦ digitinsq(1) ↦ 0 [.75ex] ③ ↦ ① ↦ ·s ·s ↦ ① ↦ digitinsq(1) ↦ 0 [.75ex] ... ③ ↦ ① ↦ ·s ↦ ① ↦ digitinsq(1) ↦ 0 [.75ex] digitinsq(2) ↦ 0 [.75ex] ... digitinsq(2) ↦ 0  $   Fix a vector space $V$. We will argue by induction on the index of nilpotency. If the map $t: V → V$ has index of nilpotency~$ 1 $ then it is the zero map and any basis is a string basis $vec(β)_1↦0$, ..., $vec(β)_n↦0$.  For the inductive step, assume that the theorem holds for any transformation $t: V → V$ with an index of nilpotency between $1$ and~$ k-1 $ (with $k>1$) and consider the index~$k$ case.  Observe that the restriction of $t$ to the range space $ map(t){t}{t} $ is also nilpotent, of index $ k-1 $. Apply the inductive hypothesis to get a string basis for $ t $, where the number and length of the strings is determined by $ t $. $ B=cat{cat{sequence{vec(β)_1,t(vec(β)_1),..., t^{h_1}(vec(β)_1)}}{ cat{sequence{vec(β)_2,...,t^{h_2}(vec(β)_2)}}}{·s}}{ sequence{vec(β)_i,...,t^{h_i}(vec(β)_i)} } $ (In the illustration above these are the vectors of kind~$ 1 $.)  Note that taking the final nonzero vector in each of these strings gives a basis $ C=sequence{t^{h_1}(vec(β)_1),...,t^{h_i}(vec(β)_i)} $ for the intersection $ t intersectionνllspace{t} $. This is because a member of $ t $ maps to zero if and only if it is a linear combination of those basis vectors that map to zero. (The illustration shows these as $ 1 $'s in squares.)  Now extend $ C $ to a basis for all of $ νllspace{t} $. $ Ĉ=C{sequence{vec(ξ)_1,...,vec(ξ)_p}} $ (In the illustration the $vec(ξ)$'s are the vectors of kind~$ 2 $ and so the set $ Ĉ $ is the set of vectors in squares.) While the vectors $ vec(ξ) $ we choose aren't uniquely determined by $t$, what is uniquely determined is the number of them: it is the dimension of $ νllspace{t} $ minus the dimension of $ t intersectionνllspace{t} $.  Finally, $ B{Ĉ} $ is a basis for $ t+νllspace{t} $ because any sum of something in the range space with something in the null space can be represented using elements of $ B $ for the range space part and elements of $ Ĉ $ for the part from the null space. Note that $ dim(t+νllspace{t}) = dim (t)+dim (νllspace{t}) -dim(t intersectionνllspace{t}) = rank(t)+νllity (t)-i = dim (V)-i $ and so we can extend $ B{Ĉ} $ to a basis for all of $ V $ by the addition of $ i $ more vectors, provided that they are not linearly dependent on what we have already. Recall that each of $ vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_i $ is in $ t $, and extend $ B{Ĉ} $ with vectors $ vec(v)_1,...,vec(v)_i $ such that $ t(vec(v)_1)=vec(β)_1,...,t(vec(v)_i)=vec(β)_i $. (In the illustration these are the $ 3 $'s.) The check that this extension preserves linear independence is .       Every nilpotent matrix is similar to a matrix that is all zeros except for blocks of subdiagonal ones. That is, every nilpotent map is represented with respect to some basis by such a matrix.   This form is unique in the sense that if a nilpotent matrix is similar to two such matrices then those two simply have their blocks ordered differently. Thus this is a canonical form for the similarity classes of nilpotent matrices provided that we order the blocks, say, from longest to shortest.  For example The matrix $ M=([ 1 -1 1 -1 ]) $ has an index of nilpotency of two, as this calculation shows.   {power $ p $} $ M^p $ νllspace{M^p} $  $ 1 $ $ M=matrixvenlarge{([ 1 -1 1 -1 ])} $ $ {matrixvenlarge{{[x x]} such that x in ℂ} $ $ 2 $ $ M^2=matrixvenlarge{([ 0 0 0 0 ])} $ $ ℂ^2 $   Because the matrix is $N by N$, any transformation that it represents is on a space of dimension two. The nullspace of one application of the map $νllspace{m}$ has dimension~one, and the nullspace of two applications $νllspace{m^2}$ has dimension~two. Thus the action of $m$ on a string basis is $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦0$ and the canonical form of the matrix is this. $ N=([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $  We can exhibit such a string basis, and also the change of basis matrices witnessing the matrix similarity between $M$ and~$N$. Suppose that $m: ℂ^2 → ℂ^2$ is such that $ M $ represents it with respect to the standard bases. (We could take $M$ to be a representation with respect to some other basis but the standard one is convenient.) Pick $ vec(β)_2 inνllspace{m} $. Also pick $ vec(β)_1 $ so that $ m(vec(β)_1)=vec(β)_2 $. $ vec(β)_2=[1 1]  vec(β)_1=[1 0] $ For the change of basis matrices, recall the similarity diagram. $  ℂ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} → (M) ℂ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} @VI V PV @VI V PV C^2_{wrt(B)} → (N) ℂ^2_{wrt(B)}  $ The canonical form equals $ Representation of (m)=PMP^{-1} $, where $ P^{-1} =Representation of (I) =([ 1 1 0 1 ])  P=(P^{-1})^{-1} =([ 1 -1 0 1 ]) $ and the verification of the matrix calculation is routine. $ ([ 1 -1 0 1 ]) ([ 1 -1 1 -1 ]) ([ 1 1 0 1 ])= ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $    For example This matrix $ ([ 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 -1 1 1 -1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 -1 1 -1 ]) $ is nilpotent, of index~$3$.          {power $ p $} $ N^p $ νllspace{N^p} $  $ 1 $ matrixvenlarge{ ([ 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 -1 1 1 -1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 -1 1 -1 ])} $ {matrixvenlarge{{[0 0 u-v u v]} such that u,v in ℂ} $ $ 2 $ $ matrixvenlarge{([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ])} $ $ {matrixvenlarge{{[0 y z u v]} such that y,z,u,v in ℂ} $ $ 3 $ --zero matrix-- $ ℂ^5 $   The table tells us this about any string basis:~the null space after one map application has dimension~two so two basis vectors map directly to zero, the null space after the second application has dimension four so two additional basis vectors map to zero by the second iteration, and the null space after three applications is of dimension~five so the remaining one basis vector maps to zero in three hops. $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ vec(β)_3 ↦ 0 vec(β)_4 ↦ vec(β)_5 ↦ 0  $ To produce such a basis, first pick two vectors from $ νllspace{n} $ that form a linearly independent set. $ vec(β)_3=[0 0 1 1 0] vec(β)_5=[0 0 0 1 1] $ Then add $ vec(β)_2,vec(β)_4 inνllspace{n^2} $ such that $ n(vec(β)_2)=vec(β)_3 $ and $ n(vec(β)_4)=vec(β)_5 $. $ vec(β)_2=[0 1 0 0 0] vec(β)_4=[0 1 0 1 0] $ Finish by adding $ vec(β)_1 $ such that $ n(vec(β)_1)=vec(β)_2 $. $ vec(β)_1=[1 0 1 0 0] $          What is the index of nilpotency of the right-shift operator, here acting on the space of triples of reals? $ (x,y,z)↦(0,x,y) $  Three. It is at least three because $l^2((1,1,1))=(0,0,1) ≠ 0$. It is at most three because $(x,y,z)↦ (0,x,y)↦ (0,0,x)↦ (0,0,0)$.   For each string basis state the index of nilpotency and give the dimension of the range space and null space of each iteration of the nilpotent map.  $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ 0 vec(β)_3 ↦ vec(β)_4 ↦ 0 $ $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ vec(β)_3 ↦ 0 vec(β)_4 ↦ 0 vec(β)_5 ↦ 0 vec(β)_6 ↦ 0 $ $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ vec(β)_3 ↦ 0 $  Also give the canonical form of the matrix.   The domain has dimension four. The map's action is that any vector in the space $c_1· vec(β)_1+c_2· vec(β)_2 +c_3· vec(β)_3+c_4· vec(β)_4$ goes to $c_1· vec(β)_2+c_2· 0 +c_3· vec(β)_4+c_4· 0 =c_1· vec(β)_3+c_3·vec(β)_4$. The first application of the map sends two basis vectors $vec(β)_2$ and $vec(β)_4$ to zero, and therefore the null space has dimension~two and the range space has dimension~two. With a second application, all four basis vectors go to zero and so the null space of the second power has dimension~four while the range space of the second power has dimension~zero. Thus the index of nilpotency is two. This is the canonical form. $ ([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $ The dimension of the domain of this map is six. For the first power the dimension of the null space is four and the dimension of the range space is two. For the second power the dimension of the null space is five and the dimension of the range space is one. Then the third iteration results in a null space of dimension six and a range space of dimension zero. The index of nilpotency is three, and this is the canonical form. $ ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ The dimension of the domain is three, and the index of nilpotency is three. The first power's null space has dimension one and its range space has dimension two. The second power's null space has dimension two and its range space has dimension one. Finally, the third power's null space has dimension three and its range space has dimension zero. Here is the canonical form matrix. $ ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $    Decide which of these matrices are nilpotent.   $([ -2 4 -1 2 ])$  $([ 3 1 1 3 ])$  $([ -3 2 1 -3 2 1 -3 2 1 ])$  $([ 1 1 4 3 0 -1 5 2 7 ])$  $([ 45 -22 -19 33 -16 -14 69 -34 -29 ])$   By the nullity has grown as large as possible by the $n$-th iteration where $n$ is the dimension of the domain. Thus, for the $N by N$ matrices, we need only check whether the square is the zero matrix. For the $N by N$ matrices, we need only check the cube.  Yes, this matrix is nilpotent because its square is the zero matrix. No, the square is not the zero matrix. $ ([ 3 1 1 3 ])^2 =([ 10 6 6 10 ]) $ Yes, the cube is the zero matrix. In fact, the square is zero. No, the third power is not the zero matrix. $ ([ 1 1 4 3 0 -1 5 2 7 ])^3 =([ 206 86 304 26 8 26 438 180 634 ]) $ Yes, the cube of this matrix is the zero matrix.  Another way to see that the second and fourth matrices are not nilpotent is to note that they are nonsingular.

Assume that $N$ is the representation of the underlying map with respect to the standard basis. Let $B$ be the basis to which we will change. By the similarity diagram $  ℂ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} → (N) ℂ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} @VI V PV @VI V PV C^2_{wrt(B)} → () ℂ^2_{wrt(B)}  $ we have that the canonical form matrix is $PNP^{-1}$ where $ P^{-1} =Representation of (I) =([ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) $ and $P$ is the inverse of that. $ P=Representation of (I) =(P^{-1})^{-1} =([ 1 0 0 0 0 -1 1 1 -1 1 -1 0 1 0 0 1 0 -1 1 -1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) $ The calculation to check this is routine.    Each of these matrices is nilpotent.  $ ([ 1/2 -1/2 1/2 -1/2 ]) $ $ ([ 0 0 0 0 -1 1 0 -1 1 ]) $ $ ([ -1 1 -1 1 0 1 1 -1 1 ]) $  Put each in canonical form.   The calculation   $ p $ N^p $ νllspace{N^p} $  $ 1 $ matrixvenlarge{([ 1/2 -1/2 1/2 -1/2 ])} $ {matrixvenlarge{{[u u]} such that u in ℂ} $ $ 2 $ --zero matrix-- $ ℂ^2 $   shows that any map represented by the matrix must act on the string basis in this way $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ 0  $ because the null space after one application has dimension~one and exactly one basis vector, $vec(β)_2$, maps to zero. Therefore, this representation with respect to $sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2}$ is the canonical form. $ ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $ The calculation here is similar to the prior one.   $ p $ N^p $ νllspace{N^p} $  $ 1 $ matrixvenlarge{([ 0 0 0 0 -1 1 0 -1 1 ])} $ {matrixvenlarge{{[u v v]} such that u,v in ℂ} $ $ 2 $ --zero matrix-- $ ℂ^3 $   The table shows that the string basis is of the form $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ 0 vec(β)_3 ↦ 0  $ because the null space after one application of the map has dimension two- $vec(β)_2$ and $vec(β)_3$ are both sent to zero- and one more iteration results in the additional vector going to zero. The calculation   $ p $ N^p $ νllspace{N^p} $  $ 1 $ matrixvenlarge{([ -1 1 -1 1 0 1 1 -1 1 ])} $ {matrixvenlarge{{[u 0 -u]} such that u in ℂ} $ $ 2 $ matrixvenlarge{([ 1 0 1 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 ])} $ {matrixvenlarge{{[u v -u]} such that u,v in ℂ} $ $ 3 $ --zero matrix-- $ ℂ^3 $   shows that any map represented by this basis must act on a string basis in this way. $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ vec(β)_3 ↦ 0  $ Therefore, this is the canonical form. $ ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $    Describe the effect of left or right multiplication by a matrix that is in the canonical form for nilpotent matrices.  A couple of examples $ ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) ([ a b c d ]) = ([ 0 0 a b ])  ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) ([ a b c d e f g h i ]) = ([ 0 0 0 a b c d e f ]) $ suggest that left multiplication by a block of subdiagonal ones shifts the rows of a matrix downward. Distinct blocks $ ([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ]) ([ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 a b c d 0 0 0 0 i j k l ]) $ act to shift down distinct parts of the matrix.  Right multiplication does an analogous thing to columns. See .   Is nilpotence invariant under similarity? That is, must a matrix similar to a nilpotent matrix also be nilpotent? If so, with the same index?  Yes. Generalize the last sentence in . As to the index, that same last sentence shows that the index of the new matrix is less than or equal to the index of $N̂$, and reversing the roles of the two matrices gives inequality in the other direction.  Another answer to this question is to show that a matrix is nilpotent if and only if any associated map is nilpotent, and with the same index. Then, because similar matrices represent the same map, the conclusion follows. This is below.   Show that the only eigenvalue of a nilpotent matrix is zero.  Observe that a canonical form nilpotent matrix has only zero eigenvalues; e.g., the determinant of this lower-triangular matrix $ ([ -x 0 0 1 -x 0 0 1 -x ]) $ is $ (-x)^3 $, the only root of which is zero. But similar matrices have the same eigenvalues and every nilpotent matrix is similar to one in canonical form.  Another way to see this is to observe that a nilpotent matrix sends all vectors to zero after some number of iterations, but that conflicts with an action on an eigenspace $vec(v)↦ λvec(v)$ unless $λ$ is zero.   Is there a nilpotent transformation of index three on a two-dimensional space?  No, by for a map on a two-dimensional space, the nullity has grown as large as possible by the second iteration.   In the proof of , why isn't the proof's base case that the index of nilpotency is zero?  The index of nilpotency of a transformation can be zero only when the vector starting the string must be $0$, that is, only when $V$ is a trivial space.   Let $ t: V → V $ be a linear transformation and suppose $ vec(v) in V $ is such that $ t^k(vec(v))=0 $ but $ t^{k-1}(vec(v)) ≠0 $. Consider the $t$-string $sequence{vec(v),t(vec(v)),...,t^{k-1}(vec(v))}$.  Prove that $ t $ is a transformation on the span of the set of vectors in the string, that is, prove that $ t $ restricted to the span has a range that is a subset of the span. We say that the span is a $ t $-invariant subspace. Prove that the restriction is nilpotent. Prove that the $t$-string is linearly independent and so is a basis for its span. Represent the restriction map with respect to the $t$-string basis.    Any member $vec(w)$ of the span is a linear combination $vec(w)=c_0· vec(v)+c_1· t(vec(v))+... +c_{k-1}· t^{k-1}(vec(v))$. But then, by the linearity of the map, $t(vec(w))=c_0· t(vec(v))+c_1· t^2(vec(v))+... +c_{k-2}· t^{k-1}(vec(v))+c_{k-1}· 0$ is also in the span. The operation in the prior item, when iterated $k$ times, will result in a linear combination of zeros. If $ vec(v)=0 $ then the set is empty and so is linearly independent by definition. Otherwise write $ c_1vec(v)+...+c_{k-1}t^{k-1}(vec(v))=0 $ and apply $ t^{k-1} $ to both sides. The right side gives $ 0 $ while the left side gives $ c_1t^{k-1}(vec(v)) $; conclude that $ c_1=0 $. Continue in this way by applying $ t^{k-2} $ to both sides, etc. Of course, $t$ acts on the span by acting on this basis as a single, $k$-long, $t$-string. $ ([ 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 1 0 0 ... 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $    Finish the proof of .  We must check that $ B∪Ĉ∪{vec{{v}_1,...,vec{{v}_j} $ is linearly independent where $ B $ is a $ t $-string basis for $ t $, where $ Ĉ $ is a basis for $ νllspace{t} $, and where $ t(vec(v)_1)=vec(β)_1,...,t(vec(v)_i)=vec(β)_i $. Write $ 0=c_{1,-1}vec(v)_1+c_{1,0}vec(β)_1 +c_{1,1}t(vec(β)_1)+...+ c_{1,{h_1}}t^{h_1}(vec{vec(β)}_1) +c_{2,-1}vec(v)_2+...+c_{j,h_i}t^{h_i}(vec(β_i)) $ and apply $ t $. $ 0=c_{1,-1}vec(β)_1+c_{1,0}t(vec(β)_1) +...+ c_{1,h_1-1}t^{h_1}(vec{vec(β)}_1)+c_{1,h_1}0 +c_{2,-1}vec(β)_2+·s+c_{i,h_i-1}t^{h_i}(vec(β_i)) +c_{i,h_i}0 $ Conclude that the coefficients $ c_{1,-1},...,c_{1,h_i-1}, c_{2,-1},...,c_{i,h_i-1} $ are all zero as $ B∪Ĉ $ is a basis. Substitute back into the first displayed equation to conclude that the remaining coefficients are zero also.   Show that the terms `nilpotent transformation' and `nilpotent matrix', as given in def:nilpotent, fit with each other:~a map is nilpotent if and only if it is represented by a nilpotent matrix. (Is it that a transformation is nilpotent if an only if there is a basis such that the map's representation with respect to that basis is a nilpotent matrix, or that any representation is a nilpotent matrix?)  For any basis $B$, a transformation~$n$ is nilpotent if and only if $N=Representation of (n)$ is a nilpotent matrix. This is because only the zero matrix represents the zero map and so $ n^j $ is the zero map if and only if $ N^j $ is the zero matrix.   Let $ T $ be nilpotent of index four. How big can the range space of $ T^3 $ be?  It can be of any size greater than or equal to one. To have a transformation that is nilpotent of index four, whose cube has range space of dimension~$k$, take a vector space, a basis for that space, and a transformation that acts on that basis in this way. $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ vec(β)_3 ↦ vec(β)_4 ↦ 0 vec(β)_5 ↦ vec(β)_6 ↦ vec(β)_7 ↦ vec(β)_8 ↦ 0 ..._{4k-3}} vec(β)_{4k-3} ↦ vec(β)_{4k-2} ↦ vec(β)_{4k-1} ↦ vec(β)_{4k} ↦ 0 ..._{4k-3}} { --possibly other, shorter, strings--}  $ So the dimension of the range space of $T^3$ can be as large as desired. The smallest that it can be is one- there must be at least one string or else the map's index of nilpotency would not be four.   Recall that similar matrices have the same eigenvalues. Show that the converse does not hold.  These two have only zero for eigenvalues $ ([ 0 0 0 0 ])  ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $ but are not similar (they have different canonical representatives, namely, themselves).  shows that any for any linear transformation $ t: V → V $ the restriction $ map(t){general rangespace(t)}{general rangespace(t)} $ is one-to-one. Show that it is also onto, so it is an automorphism. Must it be the identity map?  It is onto by . It need not be the identity: consider this map $t: ℝ^2 → ℝ^2$. $ [x y]t ↓[y x] $ For that map $general rangespace(t)= ℝ^2$, and $t$ is not the identity.   Prove that a nilpotent matrix is similar to one that is all zeros except for blocks of super-diagonal ones.  A simple reordering of the string basis will do. For instance, a map that is associated with this string basis $  vec(β)_1 ↦ vec(β)_2 ↦ 0  $ is represented with respect to $B=sequence{vec(β)_1,vec(β)_2}$ by this matrix $ ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $ but is represented with respect to $B=sequence{vec(β)_2,vec(β)_1}$ in this way. $ ([ 0 1 0 0 ]) $   Prove that if a transformation has the same range space as null space. then the dimension of its domain is even.  Let $t: V → V$ be the transformation. If $ rank(t)=νllity (t) $ then the equation $ rank(t)+νllity(t)=dim (V) $ shows that $ dim (V) $ is even.   Prove that if two nilpotent matrices commute then their product and sum are also nilpotent.  For the matrices to be nilpotent they must be square. For them to commute they must be the same size. Thus their product and sum are defined.  Call the matrices $ A $ and $ B $. To see that $ AB $ is nilpotent, multiply $ (AB)^2=ABAB=AABB=A^2B^2$, and $(AB)^3=A^3B^3$, etc., and, as $ A $ is nilpotent, that product is eventually zero.  The sum is similar; use the Binomial Theorem.                                                                             textit{This section uses material from three optional subsections:~Combining Subspaces, Determinants Exist, and Laplace's Expansion.}  We began this chapter by remembering that every linear map $h: V → W$ can be represented by a partial identity matrix with respect to some bases $B⊆ V$ and $D⊆ W$. That is, the partial identity form is a canonical form for matrix equivalence. This chapter considers transformations, where the codomain equals the domain, so we naturally ask what is possible when the two bases are equal $Representation of (t)$. In short, we want a canonical form for matrix similarity.  We noted that in the $B,B$ case a partial identity matrix is not always possible. We therefore extended the matrix forms of interest to the natural generalization, diagonal matrices, and showed that a transformation or square matrix can be diagonalized if its eigenvalues are distinct. But at the same time we gave an example of a square matrix that cannot be diagonalized (because it is nilpotent) and thus diagonal form won't suffice as the canonical form for matrix similarity.  The prior section developed that example to get a canonical form, subdiagonal ones, for nilpotent matrices.  This section finishes our program by showing that for any linear transformation there is a basis such that the matrix representation $Representation of (t)$ is the sum of a diagonal matrix and a nilpotent matrix. This is Jordan canonical form.           Recall that the set of square matrices~$ matspace(_){N by N} $ is a vector space under entry-by-entry addition and scalar multiplication, and that   this space has dimension $ n^2 $. Thus, for any $ N by N $ matrix $T$ the $ n^2+1 $-member set $ {I,T,T^2,...,T^{{n^2} } $ is linearly dependent and so there are scalars $ c_0,...,c_{n^2} $, not all zero, such that $ c_{n^2}T^{n^2}+...+c_1T+c_0I $ is the zero matrix. Therefore every transformation has a kind of generalized nilpotency:~the powers of a square matrix cannot climb forever without a ``repeat.''  For example Rotation of plane vectors $ π/6 $~radians counterclockwise is represented with respect to the standard basis by $ T= ([ √{3}/2 -1/2 1/2 √{3}/2 ]) $ and verifying that $ 0T^4+0T^3+1T^2-2T-1I $ equals the zero matrix is easy.    Let $ t $ be a linear transformation of a vector space~$ V $. Where $ f(x)=c_nx^n+...+c_1x+c_0 $ is a polynomial, $ f(t) $ is the transformation $ c_nt^n+...+c_1t+c_0(I) $ on~$ V $. In the same way, if $ T $ is a square matrix then $ f(T) $ is the matrix $ c_nT^n+...+c_1T+c_0I $.   The polynomial of the matrix represents the polynomial of the map:~if $ T=Representation of (t) $ then $ f(T)=Representation of (f(t)) $. This is because $ T^j=Representation of (t^j) $, and $ cT=Representation of (ct) $, and $ T_1+T_2 =Representation of (t_1+t_2) $.   Most authors write the matrix polynomial slightly differently than the map polynomial. For instance, if $ f(x)=x-3 $ then most authors explicitly write the identity matrix~$ f(T)=T-3I $ but don't write the identity map~$ f(t)=t-3 $. We shall follow this convention.   Consider again . The space $matspace(_){N by N}$ has dimension four so we know that for any $ N by N $ matrix there is a fourth degree polynomial $ f $ such that $ f(T) $ equals the zero matrix. But for the $ T $ in that example we exhibited a polynomial of degree less than four that gives the zero matrix. So while degree~$n^2$ always suffices, in some cases a smaller-degree polynomial works.   The minimal polynomial  $ m(x) $ of a transformation $ t $ or a square matrix $ T $ is the polynomial of least degree and with leading coefficient one such that $ m(t) $ is the zero map or $ m(T) $ is the zero matrix.   A minimal polynomial cannot be the zero polynomial because of the restriction on the leading coefficient. Obviously no other constant polynomial would do, so a minimal polynomial must have degree at least one. Thus, the zero matrix has minimal polynomial $p(x)=x$ while the identity matrix has minimal polynomial $p̂(x)=x-1$.   Any transformation or square matrix has a unique minimal polynomial.    We first prove existence. By the earlier observation that degree~$n^2$ suffices, there is at least one polynomial $p(x)=c_kx^k+·s+c_0$ that takes the map or matrix to zero, and it is not the zero polynomial by the prior paragraph. From among all such polynomials there must be at least one with minimal degree. Divide this polynomial by its leading coefficient~$c_k$ to get a leading~$1$. Hence any map or matrix has a minimal polynomial.  Now for uniqueness. Suppose that $ m(x) $ and $ m̂(x) $ both take the map or matrix to zero, are both of minimal degree and are thus of equal degree, and both have a leading~$1$. Subtract: $ d(x)=m(x)-m̂(x) $. This polynomial takes the map or matrix to zero and since the leading terms of $m$ and~$m̂$ cancel, $d$ is of smaller degree than the other two. If $d$ were to have a nonzero leading coefficient then we could divide by it to get a polynomial that takes the map or matrix to zero and has leading coefficient~$1$. This would contradict the minimality of the degree of $m$ and $m̂$. Thus the leading coefficient of $d$ is zero, so $ m(x)-m̂(x) $ is the zero polynomial, and so the two are equal.   For example We can compute that $ m(x)=x^2-2x-1 $ is minimal for the matrix of by finding the powers of $T$ up to $n^2=4$. $ T^2= ([ 1/2 -√{3}/2 √{3}/2 1/2 ])  T^3= ([ 0 -1 1 0 ])  T^4= ([ -1/2 -√{3}/2 √{3}/2 -1/2 ]) $ Put $ c_4T^4+c_3T^3+c_2T^2+c_1T+c_0I $ equal to the zero matrix $ $ -(1/2)c_4 + (1/2)c_2 + (√{3}/2)c_1 + c_0 = 0 -(√{3}/2)c_4 - c_3 - (√{3}/2)c_2 - (1/2)c_1 = 0 (√{3}/2)c_4 + c_3 + (√{3}/2)c_2 + (1/2)c_1 = 0 -(1/2)c_4 + (1/2)c_2 + (√{3}/2)c_1 + c_0 = 0 $ $ and use Gauss' Method. $ $ c_4 - c_2 - √{3}c_1 - 2c_0 = 0 c_3 + √{3}c_2 + 2c_1 + √{3}c_0 = 0 $ $ Setting $ c_4 $, $ c_3 $, and $ c_2 $ to zero forces $ c_1 $ and $ c_0 $ to also come out as zero. To get a leading one, the most we can do is to set $ c_4 $ and $ c_3 $ to zero. Thus the minimal polynomial is quadratic.   Using the method of that example to find the minimal polynomial of a $ N by N $ matrix would mean doing Gaussian reduction on a system with nine equations in ten unknowns. We shall develop an alternative.       Suppose that the polynomial $ f(x)=c_nx^n+...+c_1x+c_0 $ factors as $ k(x-λ_1)^{q_1}·s(x-λ_z)^{q_z} $. If $ t $ is a linear transformation then these two are equal maps. $ c_nt^n+...+c_1t+c_0 = k·∘{∘{(t-λ_1)^{q_1}}{·s}}{ (t-λ_z)^{q_z}} $ Consequently, if $ T $ is a square matrix then $ f(T) $ and $ k·(T-λ_1I)^{q_1}·s(T-λ_z I)^{q_z} $ are equal matrices.    We use induction on the degree of the polynomial. The cases where the polynomial is of degree~zero and degree~one are clear. The full induction argument is but we will give its sense with the degree~two case.  A quadratic polynomial factors into two linear terms $ f(x)=k(x-λ_1)·(x-λ_2) =k(x^2+(-λ_1-λ_2)x+λ_1λ_2) $ (the roots $λ_1$ and $λ_2$ could be equal). We can check that substituting $ t $ for $ x $ in the factored and unfactored versions gives the same map. $ [(k·∘{(t-λ_1)}{(t-λ_2)}]) (vec(v)) =[(k·(t-λ_1)])(t(vec(v))-λ_2vec(v)) =k·[(t(t(vec(v)))-t(λ_2vec(v)) -λ_1 t(vec(v))-λ_1λ_2vec(v)]) =k· [(∘{t}{t}(vec(v))-(λ_1+λ_2)t(vec(v)) +λ_1λ_2vec(v)]) =k·(t^2-(λ_1+λ_2)t+λ_1λ_2) (vec(v)) $ The third equality holds because the scalar $λ_2$ comes out of the second term, since $ t $ is linear.   In particular, if a minimal polynomial $m(x)$ for a transformation $t$ factors as $m(x)=(x-λ_1)^{q_1}·s (x-λ_z)^{q_z}$ then $ m(t)=∘{∘{(t-λ_1)^{q_1}}{·s}}{ (t-λ_z)^{q_z}} $ is the zero map. Since $ m(t) $ sends every vector to zero, at least one of the maps $ t-λ_i $ sends some nonzero vectors to zero. Exactly the same holds in the matrix case- if $m$ is minimal for $T$ then $ m(T)=(T-λ_1I)^{q_1}·s (T-λ_z I)^{q_z} $ is the zero matrix and at least one of the matrices $T-λ_iI$ sends some nonzero vectors to zero. That is, in both cases at least some of the $ λ_i $ are eigenvalues. ( expands on this.)  The next result is that every root of the minimal polynomial is an eigenvalue, and further that every eigenvalue is a root of the minimal polynomial (i.e, below it says `$1≤ q_i$' and not just `$0≤ q_i$'). For that result, recall that to find eigenvalues we solve $determinant(T-xI)=0$ and this determinant gives a polynomial in $x$, called the characteristic polynomial, whose roots are the eigenvalues.  [Cayley-Hamilton]    If the characteristic polynomial of a transformation or square matrix factors into $ k· (x-λ_1)^{p_1}(x-λ_2)^{p_2}·s(x-λ_z)^{p_z} $ then its minimal polynomial factors into $ (x-λ_1)^{q_1}(x-λ_2)^{q_2}·s(x-λ_z)^{q_z} $ where $ 1≤ q_i ≤ p_i $ for each $ i $ between $ 1 $ and $ z $.   The proof takes up the next three lemmas. We will state them in matrix terms but they apply equally well to maps. (The matrix version is convenient for the first proof.)  The first result is the key. For the proof, observe that we can view a matrix of polynomials as a polynomial with matrix coefficients. $ ([ 2x^2+3x-1 x^2+2 3x^2+4x+1 4x^2+x+1 ]) = ([ 2 1 3 4 ])x^2 + ([ 3 0 4 1 ])x + ([ -1 2 1 1 ]) $   If $ T $ is a square matrix with characteristic polynomial $ c(x) $ then $ c(T) $ is the zero matrix.    Let $ C $ be $ T-xI $, the matrix whose determinant is the characteristic polynomial $ c(x)=c_nx^n+...+c_1x+c_0 $. $ C=([ t_{1,1}-x t_{1,2} ... t_{2,1} t_{2,2}-x ... ... t_{n,n}-x ]) $ Recall Theorem~Four.III., that the product of a matrix with its adjoint equals the determinant of the matrix times the identity. $ c(x)· I =adj( (C)C) =adj( (C)(T-xI)) =adj( (C)T- adj(C)· x)  $ The left side of~($*$) is $c_nIx^n+c_{n-1}Ix^{n-1}+...+c_1Ix+c_0I$. For the right side, the entries of $ adj( (C) $ are polynomials, each of degree) at most $ n-1 $ since the minors of a matrix drop a row and column. As suggested before the proof, rewrite it as a polynomial with matrix coefficients: $ adj( (C)=C_){n-1}x^{n-1}+...+C_1x+C_0 $ where each $ C_i $ is a matrix of scalars. Now this is the right side of~($*$). $ [(C_{n-1}T)x^{n-1}+...+(C_1T)x+C_0T] -[C_{n-1}x^n-C_{n-2}x^{n-1}-...-C_0x] $ Equate the left and right side of ($*$)'s coefficients of $ x^n $, of $x^{n-1}$, etc. $ c_nI =-C_{n-1} c_{n-1}I =-C_{n-2}+C_{n-1}T ... c_{1}I =-C_{0}+C_{1}T c_{0}I =C_{0}T $ Multiply, from the right, both sides of the first equation by $ T^n $, both sides of the second equation by $ T^{n-1} $, etc. $ c_nT^n =-C_{n-1}T^n c_{n-1}T^{n-1} =-C_{n-2}T^{n-1}+C_{n-1}T^n ... c_{1}T =-C_{0}T+C_{1}T^2 c_{0}I =C_{0}T $ Add. The left is $ c_nT^n+c_{n-1}T^{n-1}+...+c_0I $. The right telescopes; for instance $-C_{n-1}T^n$ from the first line combines with the $C_{n-1}T^n$ half of the second line. The total on the right is the zero matrix.   We refer to that result by saying that a matrix or map satisfies its characteristic polynomial.   Where $ f(x) $ is a polynomial, if $ f(T) $ is the zero matrix then $ f(x) $ is divisible by the minimal polynomial of $ T $. That is, any polynomial that is satisfied by $ T $ is divisible by $ T $'s minimal polynomial.    Let $ m(x) $ be minimal for $ T $. The Division Theorem for Polynomials gives $ f(x)=q(x)m(x)+r(x) $ where the degree of $ r $ is strictly less than the degree of $ m $. Because $T$ satisfies both $f$ and $m$, plugging $T$ into that equation gives that $ r(T) $ is the zero matrix. That contradicts the minimality of $ m $ unless $ r $ is the zero polynomial.   Combining the prior two lemmas shows that the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial. Thus any root of the minimal polynomial is also a root of the characteristic polynomial. That is, so far we have that if $ m(x)=(x-λ_1)^{q_1}·s(x-λ_i)^{q_i} $ then $ c(x) $ has the form $ (x-λ_1)^{p_1}·s(x-λ_i)^{p_i} (x-λ_{i+1})^{p_{i+1}}·s(x-λ_z)^{p_z} $ where each $ q_j $ is less than or equal to $ p_j $. We finish the proof of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem by showing that the characteristic polynomial has no additional roots, that is, there are no $λ_{i+1}$, $λ_{i+2}$, etc.   Each linear factor of the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix is also a linear factor of the minimal polynomial.    Let $ T $ be a square matrix with minimal polynomial $ m(x) $ and assume that $ x-λ $ is a factor of the characteristic polynomial of $ T $, that $ λ $ is an eigenvalue of $ T $. We must show that $x-λ$ is a factor of $m$, i.e., that $m(λ)=0$.  Suppose that $λ$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ with associated eigenvector~$vec(v)$. Then $T· Tvec(v)=T·λvec(v)=λ Tvec(v)=λ^2vec(v)$. Similarly, $T^nvec(v)=λ^nvec(v)$. With that, we have that for any polynomial function $ p(x) $, application of the matrix $ p(T) $ to $ vec(v) $ equals the result of multiplying $ vec(v) $ by the scalar $ p(λ) $. $ p(T)·vec(v) =(c_kT^k+...+c_1T+c_0I)·vec(v) =c_kT^kvec(v)+...+c_1Tvec(v)+c_0vec(v) =c_kλ^kvec(v)+...+c_1λvec(v)+c_0vec(v) =p(λ)·vec(v) $ Since $ m(T) $ is the zero matrix, $ 0=m(T)(vec(v))=m(λ)·vec(v) $ for all $vec(v)$, and hence $ m(λ)=0 $.   That concludes the proof of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem.  For example We can use the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem to find the minimal polynomial of this matrix. $ T= ([ 2 0 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 2 -1 0 0 0 1 ]) $ First we find its characteristic polynomial $ c(x)=(x-1)(x-2)^3 $ with the usual determinant. Now, the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem says that $ T $'s minimal polynomial is either $ (x-1)(x-2) $ or $ (x-1)(x-2)^2 $ or $ (x-1)(x-2)^3 $. We can decide among the choices just by computing $ (T-1I)(T-2I)= ([ 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 1 -1 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 -1 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ and $ (T-1I)(T-2I)^2= ([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 -1 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ and so $ m(x)=(x-1)(x-2)^2 $.       What are the possible minimal polynomials if a matrix has the given characteristic polynomial?  $(x-3)^4$ $(x+1)^3(x-4)$ $(x-2)^2(x-5)^2$ $ (x+3)^2(x-1)(x-2)^2 $  What is the degree of each possibility?  The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem says that the minimal polynomial must contain the same linear factors as the characteristic polynomial, although possibly of lower degree but not of zero degree.  The possibilities are $m_1(x)=x-3$, $m_2(x)=(x-3)^2$, $m_3(x)=(x-3)^3$, and $m_4(x)=(x-3)^4$. The first is a degree one polynomial, the second is degree two, the third is degree three, and the fourth is degree four. The possibilities are $m_1(x)=(x+1)(x-4)$, $m_2(x)=(x+1)^2(x-4)$, and $m_3(x)=(x+1)^3(x-4)$. The first is a quadratic polynomial, that is, it has degree two. The second has degree three, and the third has degree four. We have $m_1(x)=(x-2)(x-5)$, $m_2(x)=(x-2)^2(x-5)$, $m_3(x)=(x-2)(x-5)^2$, and $m_4(x)=(x-2)^2(x-5)^2$. They are polynomials of degree two, three, three, and four. The possibilities are $ m_1(x)=(x+3)(x-1)(x-2) $, $ m_2(x)=(x+3)^2(x-1)(x-2) $, $ m_3(x)=(x+3)(x-1)(x-2)^2 $, and $ m_4(x)=(x+3)^2(x-1)(x-2)^2 $. The degree of $m_1$ is three, the degree of $m_2$ is four, the degree of $m_3$ is four, and the degree of $m_4$ is five.    Find the minimal polynomial of each matrix.  $ ([ 3 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 4 ]) $ $ ([ 3 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 3 ]) $ $ ([ 3 0 0 1 3 0 0 1 3 ]) $ $ ([ 2 0 1 0 6 2 0 0 2 ]) $ $ ([ 2 2 1 0 6 2 0 0 2 ]) $ $ ([ -1 4 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 -4 -1 0 0 3 -9 -4 2 -1 1 5 4 1 4 ]) $   In each case we will use the method of .  Because $T$ is triangular, $T-xI$ is also triangular $ T-xI= ([ 3-x 0 0 1 3-x 0 0 0 4-x ]) $ the characteristic polynomial is easy $c(x)=determinant(T-xI)=(3-x)^2(4-x)=-1· (x-3)^2(x-4)$. There are only two possibilities for the minimal polynomial, $m_1(x)=(x-3)(x-4)$ and $m_2(x)=(x-3)^2(x-4)$. (Note that the characteristic polynomial has a negative sign but the minimal polynomial does not since it must have a leading coefficient of one). Because $m_1(T)$ is not the zero matrix $ (T-3I)(T-4I) = ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ -1 0 0 1 -1 0 0 0 0 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ the minimal polynomial is $m(x)=m_2(x)$. $ (T-3I)^2(T-4I) =(T-3I)·[((T-3I)(T-4I)]) = ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ]) ([ 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ As in the prior item, the fact that the matrix is triangular makes computation of the characteristic polynomial easy. $ c(x)=determinant(T-xI) = ([ 3-x 0 0 1 3-x 0 0 0 3-x ]) =(3-x)^3=-1· (x-3)^3 $ There are three possibilities for the minimal polynomial $m_1(x)=(x-3)$, $m_2(x)=(x-3)^2$, and $m_3(x)=(x-3)^3$. We settle the question by computing $m_1(T)$ $ T-3I= ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ and $m_2(T)$. $ (T-3I)^2= ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Because $m_2(T)$ is the zero matrix, $m_2(x)$ is the minimal polynomial. Again, the matrix is triangular. $ c(x)=determinant(T-xI) = ([ 3-x 0 0 1 3-x 0 0 1 3-x ]) =(3-x)^3=-1· (x-3)^3 $ Again, there are three possibilities for the minimal polynomial $m_1(x)=(x-3)$, $m_2(x)=(x-3)^2$, and $m_3(x)=(x-3)^3$. We compute $m_1(T)$ $ T-3I= ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $ and $m_2(T)$ $ (T-3I)^2= ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ]) $ and $m_3(T)$. $ (T-3I)^3 =(T-3I)^2(T-3I) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ]) ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ Therefore, the minimal polynomial is $m(x)=m_3(x)=(x-3)^3$. This case is also triangular, here upper triangular. $ c(x)=determinant(T-xI)= ([ 2-x 0 1 0 6-x 2 0 0 2-x ]) =(2-x)^2(6-x)=-(x-2)^2(x-6) $ There are two possibilities for the minimal polynomial, $m_1(x)=(x-2)(x-6)$ and $m_2(x)=(x-2)^2(x-6)$. Computation shows that the minimal polynomial isn't $m_1(x)$. $ (T-2I)(T-6I)= ([ 0 0 1 0 4 2 0 0 0 ]) ([ -4 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 -4 ]) = ([ 0 0 -4 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ It therefore must be that $m(x)=m_2(x)=(x-2)^2(x-6)$. Here is a verification. $ (T-2I)^2(T-6I)=(T-2I)·[((T-2I)(T-6I)]) = ([ 0 0 1 0 4 2 0 0 0 ]) ([ 0 0 -4 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ The characteristic polynomial is $ c(x)=determinant(T-xI)= ([ 2-x 2 1 0 6-x 2 0 0 2-x ]) =(2-x)^2(6-x)=-(x-2)^2(x-6) $ and there are two possibilities for the minimal polynomial, $m_1(x)=(x-2)(x-6)$ and $m_2(x)=(x-2)^2(x-6)$. Checking the first one $ (T-2I)(T-6I)= ([ 0 2 1 0 4 2 0 0 0 ]) ([ -4 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 -4 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ shows that the minimal polynomial is $m(x)=m_1(x)=(x-2)(x-6)$. The characteristic polynomial is this. $ c(x)=determinant(T-xI)= ([ -1-x 4 0 0 0 0 3-x 0 0 0 0 -4 -1-x 0 0 3 -9 -4 2-x -1 1 5 4 1 4-x ]) =(x-3)^3(x+1)^2 $ Here are the possibilities for the minimal polynomial, listed here by ascending degree: $m_1(x)=(x-3)(x+1)$, $m_1(x)=(x-3)^2(x+1)$, $m_1(x)=(x-3)(x+1)^2$, $m_1(x)=(x-3)^3(x+1)$, $m_1(x)=(x-3)^2(x+1)^2$, and $m_1(x)=(x-3)^3(x+1)^2$. The first one doesn't pan out $ (T-3I)(T+1I) = ([ -4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -4 -4 0 0 3 -9 -4 -1 -1 1 5 4 1 1 ]) ([ 0 4 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 -4 0 0 0 3 -9 -4 3 -1 1 5 4 1 5 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -4 -4 0 -4 -4 4 4 0 4 4 ]) $ but the second one does. $ (T-3I)^2(T+1I)=(T-3I)[((T-3I)(T+1I)]) $ = ([ -4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -4 -4 0 0 3 -9 -4 -1 -1 1 5 4 1 1 ]) ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -4 -4 0 -4 -4 4 4 0 4 4 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ $ The minimal polynomial is $ m(x)=(x-3)^2(x+1) $.    Find the minimal polynomial of this matrix. $ ([ 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ]) $  Its characteristic polynomial has complex roots. $ ([ -x 1 0 0 -x 1 1 0 -x ]) =(1-x)· (x-(-(1/2)+frac{√{3}}{2}i)) · (x-(-(1/2)-frac{√{3}}{2}i)) $ As the roots are distinct, the characteristic polynomial equals the minimal polynomial.   What is the minimal polynomial of the differentiation operator $d/dx$ on $ polyspace(_n) $?  We know that $polyspace(_n)$ is a dimension $n+1$ space and that the differentiation operator is nilpotent of index~$n+1$ (for instance, taking $n=3$, $polyspace(_3)={c_3x^3+c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0 such that c_3,...,c_0 in ℂ}$ and the fourth derivative of a cubic is the zero polynomial). Represent this operator using the canonical form for nilpotent transformations. $ ([ 0 0 0 ... 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ... 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $ This is an $N by (n+1)$ matrix with an easy characteristic polynomial, $c(x)=x^{n+1}$. (Remark: this matrix is $Representation of (d/dx)$ where $B=sequence{x^n,nx^{n-1},n(n-1)x^{n-2},...,n!}$.) To find the minimal polynomial as in we consider the powers of $T-0I=T$. But, of course, the first power of $T$ that is the zero matrix is the power $n+1$. So the minimal polynomial is also $ x^{n+1} $.   Find the minimal polynomial of matrices of this form $ ([ λ 0 0 ... 0 1 λ 0 0 0 1 λ ... λ 0 0 0 ... 1 λ ]) $ where the scalar $λ$ is fixed (i.e., is not a variable).  Call the matrix $T$ and suppose that it is $ N by N $. Because $T$ is triangular, and so $T-xI$ is triangular, the characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x-λ)^n$. To see that the minimal polynomial is the same, consider $T-λ I$. $ ([ 0 0 0 ... 0 1 0 0 ... 0 0 1 0 ... 0 0 ... 1 0 ]) $ Recognize it as the canonical form for a transformation that is nilpotent of degree~$n$; the power $(T-λ I)^j$ is zero first when $j$ is $n$.   What is the minimal polynomial of the transformation of $ polyspace(_n) $ that sends $ p(x) $ to $ p(x+1) $?  The $n=3$ case provides a hint. A natural basis for $polyspace(_3)$ is $B=1,x,x^2,x^3$. The action of the transformation is $ 1↦ 1  x↦ x+1  x^2↦ x^2+2x+1  x^3↦ x^3+3x^2+3x+1 $ and so the representation $Representation of (t)$ is this upper triangular matrix. $ ([ 1 1 1 1 0 1 2 3 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 1 ]) $ Because it is triangular, the fact that the characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x-1)^4$ is clear. For the minimal polynomial, the candidates are $m_1(x)=(x-1)$, $ T-1I= ([ 0 1 1 1 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 ]) $ $m_2(x)=(x-1)^2$, $ (T-1I)^2= ([ 0 0 2 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ $m_3(x)=(x-1)^3$, $ (T-1I)^3= ([ 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ and $m_4(x)=(x-1)^4$. Because $m_1$, $m_2$, and $m_3$ are not right, $m_4$ must be right, as is easily verified.  In the case of a general $n$, the representation is an upper triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal. Thus the characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x-1)^{n+1}$. One way to verify that the minimal polynomial equals the characteristic polynomial is argue something like this: say that an upper triangular matrix is $0$-upper triangular if there are nonzero entries on the diagonal, that it is $1$-upper triangular if the diagonal contains only zeroes and there are nonzero entries just above the diagonal, etc. As the above example illustrates, an induction argument will show that, where $T$ has only nonnegative entries, $T^j$ is $j$-upper triangular.    What is the minimal polynomial of the map $ π: ℂ^3 → ℂ^3 $ projecting onto the first two coordinates?  The map twice is the same as the map once:~$∘{π}{π}=π$, that is, $π^2=π$ and so the minimal polynomial is of degree at most two since $ m(x)=x^2-x $ will do. The fact that no linear polynomial will do follows from applying the maps on the left and right side of $c_1· π+c_0· I=z$ (where $z$ is the zero map) to these two vectors. $ [0 0 1]  [1 0 0] $ Thus the minimal polynomial is $m$.   Find a $ N by N $ matrix whose minimal polynomial is $ x^2 $.  This is one answer. $ ([ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $   What is wrong with this claimed proof of : ``if $ c(x)=determinant(T-xI) $ then $ c(T)=determinant(T-TI)=0 $''?   The $ x $ must be a scalar, not a matrix.   Verify for $ N by N $ matrices by direct calculation.  The characteristic polynomial of $ T=([ a b c d ]) $ is $ (a-x)(d-x)-bc=x^2-(a+d)x+(ad-bc) $. Substitute $ ([ a b c d ])^2 - (a+d)([ a b c d ]) + (ad-bc)([ 1 0 0 1 ]) = ([ a^2+bc ab+bd ac+cd bc+d^2 ]) - ([ a^2+ad ab+bd ac+cd ad+d^2 ]) + ([ ad-bc 0 0 ad-bc ]) $ and just check each entry sum to see that the result is the zero matrix.   Prove that the minimal polynomial of an $ N by N $ matrix has degree at most $ n $ (not $ n^2 $ as a person might guess from this subsection's opening). Verify that this maximum, $ n $, can happen.  By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem the degree of the minimal polynomial is less than or equal to the degree of the characteristic polynomial, $ n $. shows that $ n $ can happen.   Show that, on a nontrivial vector space, a linear transformation is nilpotent if and only if its only eigenvalue is zero.  Let the linear transformation be $t: V → V$. If $t$ is nilpotent then there is an $n$ such that $t^n$ is the zero map, so $t$ satisfies the polynomial $p(x)=x^n=(x-0)^n$. By the minimal polynomial of $t$ divides $p$, so the minimal polynomial has only zero for a root. By Cayley-Hamilton, , the characteristic polynomial has only zero for a root. Thus the only eigenvalue of $t$ is zero.  Conversely, if a transformation $ t $ on an $ n $-dimensional space has only the single eigenvalue of zero then its characteristic polynomial is $ x^n $. The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem says that a map satisfies its characteristic polynomial so $ t^n $ is the zero map. Thus $t$ is nilpotent.   What is the minimal polynomial of a zero map or matrix? Of an identity map or matrix?  A minimal polynomial must have leading coefficient $1$, and so if the minimal polynomial of a map or matrix were to be a degree zero polynomial then it would be $m(x)=1$. But the identity map or matrix equals the zero map or matrix only on a trivial vector space.  So in the nontrivial case the minimal polynomial must be of degree at least one. A zero map or matrix has minimal polynomial $ m(x)=x $, and an identity map or matrix has minimal polynomial $ m(x)=x-1 $.   Interpret the minimal polynomial of geometrically.  We can interpret the polynomial can geometrically as, ``a $ degs(60) $ rotation minus two rotations of $ degs(30) $ equals the identity.''   What is the minimal polynomial of a diagonal matrix?  For a diagonal matrix $ T= ([ t_{1,1} 0 0 t_{2,2} ... t_{n,n} ]) $ the characteristic polynomial is $(t_{1,1}-x)(t_{2,2}-x)·s (t_{n,n}-x)$. Of course, some of those factors may be repeated, e.g., the matrix might have $t_{1,1}=t_{2,2}$. For instance, the characteristic polynomial of $ D= ([ 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 ]) $ is $ (3-x)^2(1-x)=-1· (x-3)^2(x-1) $.  To form the minimal polynomial, take the terms $ x-t_{i,i} $, throw out repeats, and multiply them together. For instance, the minimal polynomial of $D$ is $ (x-3)(x-1) $. To check this, note first that , the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, requires that each linear factor in the characteristic polynomial appears at least once in the minimal polynomial. One way to check the other direction- that in the case of a diagonal matrix, each linear factor need appear at most once- is to use a matrix argument. A diagonal matrix, multiplying from the left, rescales rows by the entry on the diagonal. But in a product $(T-t_{1,1}I)·s$, even without any repeat factors, every row is zero in at least one of the factors.  For instance, in the product $ (D-3I)(D-1I)=(D-3I)(D-1I)I= ([ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -2 ]) ([ 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 ]) ([ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $ because the first and second rows of the first matrix $D-3I$ are zero, the entire product will have a first row and second row that are zero. And because the third row of the middle matrix $D-1I$ is zero, the entire product has a third row of zero.   A projection  is any transformation $ t $ such that $ t^2=t $. (For instance, consider the transformation of the plane $ ℝ^2$ projecting each vector onto its first coordinate. If we project twice then we get the same result as if we project just once.) What is the minimal polynomial of a projection?  This subsection starts with the observation that the powers of a linear transformation cannot climb forever without a ``repeat'', that is, that for some power~$n$ there is a linear relationship $c_n· t^n+...+c_1· t+c_0· I=z$ where $z$ is the zero transformation. The definition of projection is that for such a map one linear relationship is quadratic, $t^2-t=z$. To finish, we need only consider whether this relationship might not be minimal, that is, are there projections for which the minimal polynomial is constant or linear?  For the minimal polynomial to be constant, the map would have to satisfy that $c_0·I=z$, where $c_0=1$ since the leading coefficient of a minimal polynomial is $1$. This is only satisfied by the zero transformation on a trivial space. This is a projection, but not an interesting one.  For the minimal polynomial of a transformation to be linear would give $c_1· t+c_0·I=z$ where $c_1=1$. This equation gives $t=-c_0· I$. Coupling it with the requirement that $t^2=t$ gives $t^2=(-c_0)^2·I=-c_0·I$, which gives that $c_0=0$ and $t$ is the zero transformation or that $c_0=1$ and $t$ is the identity.  Thus, except in the cases where the projection is a zero map or an identity map, the minimal polynomial is $m(x)=x^2-x$.   The first two items of this question are review.  Prove that the composition of one-to-one maps is one-to-one. Prove that if a linear map is not one-to-one then at least one nonzero vector from the domain maps to the zero vector in the codomain. Verify the statement, excerpted here, that precedes .  ...{} if a minimal polynomial $m(x)$ for a transformation $t$ factors as $m(x)=(x-λ_1)^{q_1}·s (x-λ_z)^{q_z}$ then $ m(t)=∘{∘{(t-λ_1)^{q_1}}{·s}}{ (t-λ_z)^{q_z}} $ is the zero map. Since $ m(t) $ sends every vector to zero, at least one of the maps $ t-λ_i $ sends some nonzero vectors to zero. ...{} That is, ...{} at least some of the $ λ_i $ are eigenvalues.     textit{This is a property of functions in general, not just of linear functions.} Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are one-to-one functions such that $∘{f}{g}$ is defined. Let $∘{f}{g}(x_1)=∘{f}{g}(x_2)$, so that $f(g(x_1))=f(g(x_2))$. Because $f$ is one-to-one this implies that $g(x_1)=g(x_2)$. Because $g$ is also one-to-one, this in turn implies that $x_1=x_2$. Thus, in summary, $∘{f}{g}(x_1)=∘{f}{g}(x_2)$ implies that $x_1=x_2$ and so $∘{f}{g}$ is one-to-one. If the linear map $h$ is not one-to-one then there are unequal vectors $vec(v)_1$, $vec(v)_2$ that map to the same value $h(vec(v)_1)=h(vec(v)_2)$. Because $h$ is linear, we have $0=h(vec(v)_1)-h(vec(v)_2)=h(vec(v)_1-vec(v)_2)$ and so $vec(v)_1-vec(v)_2$ is a nonzero vector from the domain that $h$ maps to the zero vector of the codomain ($vec(v)_1-vec(v)_2$ does not equal the zero vector of the domain because $vec(v)_1$ does not equal $vec(v)_2$). The minimal polynomial $m(t)$ sends every vector in the domain to zero and so it is not one-to-one (except in a trivial space, which we ignore). By the first item of this question, since the composition $m(t)$ is not one-to-one, at least one of the components $t-λ_i$ is not one-to-one. By the second item, $t-λ_i$ has a nontrivial null space. Because $(t-λ_i)(vec(v))=0$ holds if and only if $t(vec(v))=λ_i·vec(v)$, the prior sentence gives that $λ_i$ is an eigenvalue (recall that the definition of eigenvalue requires that the relationship hold for at least one nonzero $vec(v)$).    True or false:~for a transformation on an $ n $ dimensional space, if the minimal polynomial has degree $ n $ then the map is diagonalizable.  This is false. The natural example of a non-diagonalizable transformation works here. Consider the transformation of $ ℂ^2$ represented with respect to the standard basis by this matrix. $ N= ([ 0 1 0 0 ]) $ The characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=x^2$. Thus the minimal polynomial is either $m_1(x)=x$ or $m_2(x)=x^2$. The first is not right since $N-0· I$ is not the zero matrix, thus in this example the minimal polynomial has degree equal to the dimension of the underlying space, and, as mentioned, we know this matrix is not diagonalizable because it is nilpotent.   Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial. Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are similar matrices then $f(A)$ is similar to $f(B)$.  Now show that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial. Show that similar matrices have the same minimal polynomial. Decide if these are similar. $ ([ 1 3 2 3 ])  ([ 4 -1 1 1 ]) $   Let $ A $ and $ B $ be similar $ A=PBP^{-1} $. From the facts that $ A^n=(PBP^{-1})^n=(PBP^{-1})(PBP^{-1})·s(PBP^{-1}) =PB(P^{-1}P)B(P^{-1}P)·s (P^{-1}P)BP^{-1} =PB^nP^{-1} $ and $c· A=c·(PBP^{-1})=P(c· B)P^{-1}$ follows the required fact that for any polynomial function $f$ we have $ f(A)=Pf(B)P^{-1} $. For instance, if $f(x)=x^2+2x+3$ then $ A^2+2A+3I=(PBP^{-1})^2+2· PBP^{-1}+3· I =(PBP^{-1})(PBP^{-1})+P(2B)P^{-1}+3· PP^{-1} =P(B^2+2B+3I)P^{-1} $ shows that $f(A)$ is similar to $f(B)$.  Taking $f$ to be a linear polynomial we have that $A-xI$ is similar to $B-xI$. Similar matrices have equal determinants (since $determinant(A)=deter{PBP^{-1}} =determinant(P)·determinant(B)·deter{P^{-1}} =1·determinant(B)· 1=determinant(B)$). Thus the characteristic polynomials are equal.  As $ P $ and $ P^{-1} $ are invertible, $ f(A) $ is the zero matrix when, and only when, $ f(B) $ is the zero matrix. They cannot be similar since they don't have the same characteristic polynomial. The characteristic polynomial of the first one is $x^2-4x-3$ while the characteristic polynomial of the second is $x^2-5x+5$.     Show that a matrix is invertible if and only if the constant term in its minimal polynomial is not $0$. Show that if a square matrix $ T $ is not invertible then there is a nonzero matrix $ S $ such that $ ST $ and $ TS $ both equal the zero matrix.   Suppose that $ m(x)=x^n+m_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+m_1x+m_0 $ is minimal for $ T $.   For the `if' argument, because $ T^n+...+m_1T+m_0I $ is the zero matrix we have that $ I=(T^n+...+m_1T)/(-m_0)= T· (T^{n-1}+...+m_1I)/(-m_0) $ and so the matrix $(-1/m_0)· (T^{n-1}+...+m_1I)$ is the inverse of $T$. For `only if', suppose that $ m_0=0 $ (we put the $ n=1 $ case aside but it is easy) so that $ T^n+...+m_1T=(T^{n-1}+...+m_1I)T $ is the zero matrix. Note that $ T^{n-1}+...+m_1I $ is not the zero matrix because the degree of the minimal polynomial is $ n $. If $ T^{-1} $ exists then multiplying both $ (T^{n-1}+...+m_1I)T $ and the zero matrix from the right by $T^{-1}$ gives a contradiction. If $ T $ is not invertible then the constant term in its minimal polynomial is zero. Thus, $ T^n+...+m_1T=(T^{n-1}+...+m_1I)T=T(T^{n-1}+...+m_1I) $ is the zero matrix.     Finish the proof of . Give an example to show that the result does not hold if $t$ is not linear.     For the inductive step, assume that is true for polynomials of degree $ i,...,k-1 $ and consider a polynomial $ f(x) $ of degree $ k $. Factor $f(x)=k(x-λ_1)^{q_1}·s(x-λ_z)^{q_z}$ and let $ k(x-λ_1)^{q_1-1}·s(x-λ_z)^{q_z} $ be $ c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+·s+c_1x+c_0 $. Substitute: $ k∘{∘{(t-λ_1)^{q_1}}{·s}}{ (t-λ_z)^{q_z}}(vec(v)) = ∘{(t-λ_1)}{ ∘{∘{(t-λ_1)^{q_1}}{·s}}{ (t-λ_z)^{q_z}} } (vec(v)) = (t-λ_1)(c_{n-1}t^{n-1}(vec(v))+·s+c_0vec(v)) = f(t)(vec(v)) $ (the second equality follows from the inductive hypothesis and the third from the linearity of $ t $). One example is to consider the squaring map $s: ℝ → ℝ$ given by $s(x)=x^2$. It is nonlinear. The action defined by the polynomial $f(t)=t^2-1$ changes $s$ to $f(s)=s^2-1$, which is this map. $ xs^2-1 ↓ ∘{s}{s}(x)-1=x^4-1 $ Observe that this map differs from the map $∘{(s-1)}{(s+1)}$; for instance, the first map takes $x=5$ to $624$ while the second one takes $x=5$ to $675$.                                                                Any transformation or square matrix has a minimal polynomial. Does the converse hold?  Yes. Expand down the last column to check that $ x^n+m_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+m_1x+m_0 $ is plus or minus the determinant of this. $ ([ -x 0 0 m_0 0 1-x 0 m_1 0 0 1-x m_2 ... 1-x m_{n-1} ]) $                We are looking for a canonical form for matrix similarity. This subsection completes this program by moving from the canonical form for the classes of nilpotent matrices to the canonical form for all classes.   A linear transformation on a nontrivial vector space is nilpotent if and only if its only eigenvalue is zero.    Let the linear transformation be $t: V → V$. If $t$ is nilpotent then there is an $n$ such that $t^n$ is the zero map, so $t$ satisfies the polynomial $p(x)=x^n=(x-0)^n$. By the minimal polynomial of $t$ divides $p$, so the minimal polynomial has only zero for a root. By Cayley-Hamilton, , the characteristic polynomial has only zero for a root. Thus the only eigenvalue of $t$ is zero.  Conversely, if a transformation $ t $ on an $ n $-dimensional space has only the single eigenvalue of zero then its characteristic polynomial is $ x^n $. says that a map satisfies its characteristic polynomial so $ t^n $ is the zero map. Thus $t$ is nilpotent.   The `nontrivial vector space' is in the statement of that lemma because on a trivial space ${0}$ the only transformation is the zero map, which has no eigenvalues because there are no associated nonzero eigenvectors.   The transformation $t-λ$ is nilpotent if and only if $t$'s only eigenvalue is $λ$.    The transformation $ t-λ $ is nilpotent if and only if $t-λ$'s only eigenvalue is $ 0 $. That holds if and only if $t$'s only eigenvalue is $λ$, because $ t(vec(v))=λvec(v) $ if and only if $ (t-λ)(vec(v))=0·vec(v) $.   We already have the canonical form that we want for the case of nilpotent matrices, that is, for each matrix whose only eigenvalue is zero. Corollary~III. says that each such matrix is similar to one that is all zeroes except for blocks of subdiagonal ones.     If the matrices $ T-λ I $ and $ N $ are similar then $ T $ and $ N+λ I $ are also similar, via the same change of basis matrices.    With $ N=P(T-λ I)P^{-1}=PTP^{-1}-P(λ I)P^{-1} $ we have $N=PTP^{-1}-PP^{-1}(λ I)$ since the diagonal matrix $ λ I $ commutes with anything, and so $ N=PTP^{-1}-λ I $. Therefore $ N+λ I=PTP^{-1} $.   For example The characteristic polynomial of $ T=([ 2 -1 1 4 ]) $ is $ (x-3)^2 $ and so $ T $ has only the single eigenvalue $ 3 $. Thus for $ T-3I=([ -1 -1 1 1 ]) $ the only eigenvalue is $ 0 $ and $ T-3I $ is nilpotent. Finding the null spaces is routine; to ease this computation we take $T$ to represent a transformation $t: ℂ^2 → ℂ^2$ with respect to the standard basis (we shall do this for the rest of the chapter). $ νllspace{t-3}={[-y y] such that y in ℂ}  νllspace{(t-3)^2}= ℂ^2 $ The dimension of each null space shows that the action of the map $t-3$ on a string basis is $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦0$. Thus, here is the canonical form for $t-3$ with one choice for a string basis. $ Representation of (t-3) =N =([ 0 0 1 0 ])  B=[1 1],[-2 2] $ By , $ T $ is similar to this matrix. $ Representation of (t)= N+3I= ([ 3 0 1 3 ]) $ We can produce the similarity computation. Recall how to find the change of basis matrices $P$ and $P^{-1}$ to express $ N $ as $ P(T-3I)P^{-1} $. The similarity diagram $  ℂ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} → (T-3I) ℂ^2_{wrt(\stdbasis_2)} @VI V PV @VI V PV ℂ^2_{wrt(B)} → (N) ℂ^2_{wrt(B)}  $ describes that to move from the lower left to the upper left we multiply by $ P^{-1}=[(Representation of (I)])^{-1} =Representation of (I) =([ 1 -2 1 2 ]) $ and to move from the upper right to the lower right we multiply by this matrix. $ P=([ 1 -2 1 2 ])^{-1} =([ 1/2 1/2 -1/4 1/4 ]) $ So this equation expresses the similarity. $ ([ 3 0 1 3 ]) = ([ 1/2 1/2 -1/4 1/4 ]) ([ 2 -1 1 4 ]) ([ 1 -2 1 2 ]) $   For example This matrix has characteristic polynomial $ (x-4)^4 $ $ T= ([ 4 1 0 -1 0 3 0 1 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 5 ]) $ and so has the single eigenvalue $4$. The null space of $t-4$ has dimension two, the null space of $(t-4)^2$ has dimension three, and the null space of $(t-4)^3$ has dimension four. Thus, $t-4$ has the action on a string basis of $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3↦0$ and $vec(β)_4↦0$. This gives the canonical form $N$ for $t-4$, which in turn gives the form for $ t $. $ N+4I= ([ 4 0 0 0 1 4 0 0 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 4 ]) $   An array that is all zeroes, except for some number $λ$ down the diagonal and blocks of subdiagonal ones, is a Jordan block. We have shown that Jordan block matrices are canonical representatives of the similarity classes of single-eigenvalue matrices.  For example The $ N by N $ matrices whose only eigenvalue is $ 1/2 $ separate into three similarity classes. The three classes have these canonical representatives. $ ([ 1/2 0 0 0 1/2 0 0 0 1/2 ])  ([ 1/2 0 0 1 1/2 0 0 0 1/2 ])  ([ 1/2 0 0 1 1/2 0 0 1 1/2 ]) $ In particular, this matrix $ ([ 1/2 0 0 0 1/2 0 0 1 1/2 ]) $ belongs to the similarity class represented by the middle one, because we have adopted the convention of ordering the blocks of subdiagonal ones from the longest block to the shortest.   We will finish the program of this chapter by extending this work to cover maps and matrices with multiple eigenvalues. The best possibility for general maps and matrices would be if we could break them into a part involving their first eigenvalue $ λ_1 $ (which we represent using its Jordan block), a part with $ λ_2 $, etc.  This best possibility is what happens. For any transformation $ t: V → V $, we shall break the space $ V $ into the direct sum of a part on which $ t-λ_1 $ is nilpotent, a part on which $ t-λ_2 $ is nilpotent, etc.       Suppose that $ t: V → V $ is a linear transformation. The restriction of $ t $ to a subspace $ M $ need not be a linear transformation on $ M $ because there may be an $ vec(m) in M $ with $ t(vec(m)) not in M $ (for instance, the transformation that rotates the plane by a quarter turn does not map most members of the $x=y$ line subspace back within that subspace). To ensure that the restriction of a transformation to a part of a space is a transformation on the part we need the next condition.   Let $ t: V → V $ be a transformation. A subspace $ M $ is $t$ invariant  if whenever $ vec(m) in M $ then $ t(vec(m)) in M $ (shorter: $ t(M)⊆ M $).   Recall that Lemma~III. shows that for any transformation~$t$ on an $n$~dimensional space the range spaces of iterates are stable $ t^n=rangespace{t^{n+1}}=·s=general rangespace(t) $ as are the null spaces. $ νllspace{t^n}=νllspace{t^{n+1}}=·s=general nullspace(t) $ Thus, the generalized null space $general nullspace(t)$ and the generalized range space $general rangespace(t)$ are $t$~invariant.         In particular, $general nullspace(t-λ_i)$ and $general rangespace(t-λ_i)$ are $t-λ_i$~invariant.  The action of the transformation $t-λ_i$ on $general nullspace(t-λ_i)$ is especially easy to understand. Observe that any transformation~$t$ is nilpotent on $general nullspace(t)$, because if $vec(v) ingeneral nullspace(t)$ then by definition $t^n(vec(v))=0$. Thus $t-λ_i$ is nilpotent on $general nullspace(t-λ_i)$.     We shall take three steps to prove this section's major result. The next result is the first.     A subspace is $ t $ invariant if and only if it is $ t-λ $ invariant for all scalars $ λ $. In particular, if $ λ_i $ is an eigenvalue of a linear transformation $ t $ then for any other eigenvalue $λ_j$ the spaces $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $ and $ general rangespace(t-λ_i) $ are $ t-λ_j $ invariant.    For the first sentence we check the two implications separately. The `if' half is easy: if the subspace is $t-λ$ invariant for all scalars $λ$ then using $λ=0$ shows that it is $t$ invariant. For `only if' suppose that the subspace is $t$ invariant, so that if $vec(m) in M$ then $t(vec(m)) in M$, and let $λ$ be a scalar. The subspace $M$ is closed under linear combinations and so if $t(vec(m)) in M$ then $t(vec(m))-λvec(m) in M$. Thus if $vec(m) in M$ then $(t-λ)(vec(m)) in M$.  The lemma's second sentence follows from its first. The two spaces are $t-λ_i$~invariant so they are $ t $~invariant. Apply the first sentence again to conclude that they are also $ t-λ_j $ invariant.   The second step of the three that we will take to prove this section's major result makes use of an additional property of $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $ and $ general rangespace(t-λ_i) $, that they are complementary. Recall that if a space is the direct sum of two others $ V=𝒩⊕ ℛ $ then any vector $ vec(v) $ in the space breaks into two parts $ vec(v)=vec(n)+vec$ where $ vec(n) in 𝒩 $ and $ vec(in) ℛ $, and recall also that if $ B_{𝒩} $ and $ B_{ℛ} $ are bases for $ 𝒩 $ and $ ℛ $ then the concatenation $ cat{B_{𝒩}}{B_{ℛ}} $ is linearly independent. The next result says that for any subspaces $ 𝒩 $ and $ ℛ $ that are complementary as well as $ t $~invariant, the action of $ t $ on $ vec(v) $ breaks into the actions of $ t $ on $ vec(n) $ and on $ vec$.   Let $ t: V → V $ be a transformation and let $ 𝒩 $ and $ ℛ $ be $ t $ invariant complementary subspaces of $ V $. Then we can represent $ t $ by a matrix with blocks of square submatrices $T_1$ and $T_2$ $ ([ T_1 Z_2 Z_1 T_2 ]) $ \} $dim(𝒩)$-many rows \} $dim(ℛ)$-many rows $ $ where $ Z_1 $ and $ Z_2 $ are blocks of zeroes.    Since the two subspaces are complementary, the concatenation of a basis for $ 𝒩 $ with a basis for $ ℛ $ makes a basis $ B=sequence{vec(ν)_1,...,vec(ν)_p, vec(μ)_1,...,vec(μ)_q} $ for $ V $. We shall show that the matrix $ Representation of (t)= ([ ... ... rep{t(vec(ν)_1)}{B} ·s rep{t(vec(μ)_q)}{B} ... ... ]) $ has the desired form.  Any vector $ vec(v) in V $ is a member of $ 𝒩 $ if and only if when it is represented with respect to $ B $ the final $ q $ coefficients are zero. As $ 𝒩 $ is $ t $~invariant, each of the vectors $ rep{t(vec(ν)_1)}{B} $, ..., $ rep{t(vec(ν)_p)}{B} $ has this form. Hence the lower left of $ Representation of (t) $ is all zeroes. The argument for the upper right is similar.   To see that we have decomposed $ t $ into its action on the parts, let $B_{𝒩}=sequence{vec(ν)_1,...,vec(ν)_p}$ and $B_{ℛ}=sequence{vec(μ)_1,...,vec(μ)_q}$. The restrictions of $ t $ to the subspaces $ 𝒩 $ and~$ ℛ $ are represented with respect to the bases $B_{𝒩},B_{𝒩}$ and $B_{ℛ},B_{ℛ}$ by the matrices $ T_1 $ and $ T_2 $. So with subspaces that are invariant and complementary we can split the problem of examining a linear transformation into two lower-dimensional subproblems. The next result illustrates this decomposition into blocks.   If $T$ is a matrix with square submatrices $T_1$ and $T_2$ $ T= ([ T_1 Z_2 Z_1 T_2 ]) $ where the $ Z $'s are blocks of zeroes, then $ determinant(T)=determinant(T_1)·determinant(T_2) $.    Suppose that $ T $ is $ N by N $, that $ T_1 $ is $ N by p $, and that $ T_2 $ is $ N by q $. In the permutation formula for the determinant $ determinant(T)= ∑_{permutations φ} t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}·s t_{n,φ(n)}sgn((φ)) $ each term comes from a rearrangement of the column numbers $ 1,...,n $ into a new order $ φ(1),...,φ(n) $. The upper right block $Z_2$ is all zeroes, so if a $ φ $ has at least one of $ p+1,...,n $ among its first $ p $ column numbers $ φ(1),...,φ(p) $ then the term arising from $ φ $ does not contribute to the sum because it is zero, e.g., if $ φ(1)=n $ then $ t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}... t_{n,φ(n)} =0· t_{2,φ(2)}... t_{n,φ(n)}=0 $.  So the above formula reduces to a sum over all permutations with two halves:~any contributing $φ$ is the composition of a $φ_1$ that rearranges only $ 1,...,p $ and a $φ_2$ that rearranges only $ p+1,...,p+q $. Now, the distributive law and the fact that the signum of a composition is the product of the signums gives that this $ determinant(T_1)·determinant(T_2)= g(∑_{begin(subarray) perms φ_1 of 1,...,p end(subarray)} t_{1,φ_1(1)}·s t_{p,φ_1(p)}sgn((φ_1) g)) · g(∑_{begin(subarray) perms φ_2 of p+1,...,p+q end(subarray)} t_{p+1,φ_2(p+1)}·s t_{p+q,φ_2(p+q)}sgn((φ_2)) g) $ equals $determinant(T)= ∑_{contributing φ} t_{1,φ(1)}t_{2,φ(2)}·s t_{n,φ(n)}sgn((φ)$.)   For example $ ([ 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 ]) =([ 2 0 1 2 ]) · ([ 3 0 0 3 ]) =36 $   From we conclude that if two subspaces are complementary and $ t $~invariant then $ t $ is one-to-one if and only if its restriction to each subspace is nonsingular.  Now for the promised third, and final, step to the main result.   If a linear transformation $ t: V → V $ has the characteristic polynomial $ (x-λ_1)^{p_1}...(x-λ_k)^{p_k} $ then (1)~$ V=general nullspace(t-λ_1)⊕·s ⊕general nullspace(t-λ_k) $ and (2)~$ dim(general nullspace(t-λ_i))=p_i $.    This argument consists of proving two preliminary claims, followed by proofs of clauses~(1) and~(2).  The first claim is that $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) intersectiongeneral nullspace(t-λ_j)={0} $ when $ i ≠ j $. By both $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $ and $ general nullspace(t-λ_j) $ are $ t $~invariant. The intersection of $ t $ invariant subspaces is $ t $ invariant and so the restriction of $ t $ to $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) intersectiongeneral nullspace(t-λ_j) $ is a linear transformation. Now, $t-λ_i$ is nilpotent on $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $ and $t-λ_j$ is nilpotent on $ general nullspace(t-λ_j) $, so both $ t-λ_i $ and $ t-λ_j $ are nilpotent on the intersection. Therefore by and the observation following it, if $ t $ has any eigenvalues on the intersection then the ``only'' eigenvalue is both $ λ_i $ and $ λ_j $. This cannot be, so the restriction has no eigenvalues: $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) intersectiongeneral nullspace(t-λ_j) $ is the trivial space ( shows that the only transformation that is without any eigenvalues is the transformation on the trivial space).  The second claim is that $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) ⊆ general rangespace(t-λ_j) $, where $ i ≠ j $. To verify it we will show that $ t-λ_j $ is one-to-one on $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $ so that, since $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $ is $ t-λ_j $ invariant by , the map $ t-λ_j $ is an automorphism of the subspace $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $ and therefore that $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $ is a subset of each $ t-λ_j $, $ (t-λ_j)^2 $, etc. For the verification that the map is one-to-one suppose that $ vec(v) ingeneral nullspace(t-λ_i) $ is in the null space of $ t-λ_j $, aiming to show that $ vec(v)=0 $. Consider the map $ [(t-λ_i)-(t-λ_j)]^n $. On the one hand, the only vector that $ (t-λ_i)-(t-λ_j)=λ_i-λ_j $ maps to zero is the zero vector. On the other hand, as in the proof of we can apply the binomial expansion to get this. $ (t-λ_i)^n(vec(v)) +(n choose 1)(t-λ_i)^{n-1}(t-λ_j)^1(vec(v)) +(n choose 2)(t-λ_i)^{n-2}(t-λ_j)^2(vec(v)) +·s $ The first term is zero because $ vec(v) ingeneral nullspace(t-λ_i) $ while the remaining terms are zero because $ vec(v) $ is in the null space of $ t-λ_j $. Therefore $ vec(v)=0 $.  With those two preliminary claims done we can prove clause~(1), that the space is the direct sum of the generalized null spaces. By Corollary~III. the space is the direct sum $ V=general nullspace(t-λ_1)⊕general rangespace(t-λ_1) $. By the second claim $ general nullspace(t-λ_2)⊆general rangespace(t-λ_1) $ and so we can get a basis for $ general rangespace(t-λ_1) $ by starting with a basis for $ general nullspace(t-λ_2) $ and adding extra basis elements taken from $ general rangespace(t-λ_1) intersectiongeneral rangespace(t-λ_2) $. Thus $ V=general nullspace(t-λ_1)⊕general nullspace(t-λ_2) ⊕ (general rangespace(t-λ_1) intersectiongeneral rangespace(t-λ_2)) $. Continuing in this way we get this. $ V=general nullspace(t-λ_1)⊕·s⊕general rangespace(t-λ_k) ⊕ (general rangespace(t-λ_1) intersection·s intersectiongeneral rangespace(t-λ_k)) $ The first claim above shows that the final space is trivial.  We finish by verifying clause~(2). Decompose $ V $ as $ general nullspace(t-λ_i)⊕general rangespace(t-λ_i) $  and apply . $ T=  ([ T_1 Z_2 Z_1 T_2 ]) $ \} $dim(general nullspace(t-λ_i)$-many rows) \} $dim(general rangespace(t-λ_i)$-many rows) $ $ says that $ determinant(T-xI)=determinant(T_1-xI)·determinant(T_2-xI) $. By the uniqueness clause of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, Theorem~I., the determinants of the blocks have the same factors as the characteristic polynomial $ determinant(T_1-xI)=(x-λ_1)^{q_1}·s(x-λ_z)^{q_k} $ and $ determinant(T_2-xI)=(x-λ_1)^{r_1}·s(x-λ_z)^{r_k} $, where $ q_1+r_1=p_1 $, ..., $ q_k+r_k=p_k $. We will finish by establishing that (i)~$q_j=0$ for all $j ≠ i$, and (ii)~$q_i=p_i$. Together these prove clause~(2) because they show that the degree of the polynomial $determinant(T_1-xI)$ is $q_i$ and the degree of that polynomial equals the dimension of the generalized null space $general nullspace(t-λ_i)$.  For (i), because the restriction of $ t-λ_i $ to $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $ is nilpotent on that space, $t$'s only eigenvalue on that space is $ λ_i $, by . So $q_j=0$ for $j ≠ i$.  For (ii), consider the restriction of $ t $ to $ general rangespace(t-λ_i) $. By Lemma~III., the map $ t-λ_i $ is one-to-one on $ general rangespace(t-λ_i) $ and so $ λ_i $ is not an eigenvalue of $ t $ on that subspace. Therefore $ x-λ_i $ is not a factor of $ determinant(T_2-xI) $, so $r_i=0$, and so $ q_i=p_i $.   Recall the goal of this chapter, to give a canonical form for matrix similarity. That result is next. It translates the above steps into matrix terms.     Any square matrix is similar to one in Jordan form $ ([ J_{λ_1} --zeroes-- J_{λ_2} ... J_{λ_{k-1}} --zeroes-- J_{λ_{k}} ]) $ where each $ J_{λ} $ is the Jordan block associated with an eigenvalue $λ$ of the original matrix (that is, each $ J_{λ} $ is all zeroes except for $ λ $'s down the diagonal and some subdiagonal ones).    Given an $ N by N $ matrix $ T $, consider the linear map $ t: ℂ^n → ℂ^n $ that it represents with respect to the standard bases. Use the prior lemma to write $ ℂ^n=general nullspace(t-λ_1)⊕·s ⊕general nullspace(t-λ_k) $ where $ λ_1 $, ..., $λ_k $ are the eigenvalues of $ t $. Because each $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $ is $ t $ invariant, and the prior lemma show that $ t $ is represented by a matrix that is all zeroes except for square blocks along the diagonal. To make those blocks into Jordan blocks, pick each $ B_{λ_i} $ to be a string basis for the action of $ t-λ_i $ on $ general nullspace(t-λ_i) $.    Every square matrix is similar to the sum of a diagonal matrix and a nilpotent matrix.   For Jordan form a canonical form for matrix similarity, strictly speaking it must be unique. That is, for any square matrix there needs to be one and only one matrix $J$ similar to it and of the specified form. As stated the theorem allows us to rearrange the Jordan blocks. We could make this form unique, say by arranging the Jordan blocks so the eigenvalues are in order, and then arranging the blocks of subdiagonal ones from longest to shortest. Below, we won't bother with that.  For example This matrix has the characteristic polynomial $ (x-2)^2(x-6) $. $ T= ([ 2 0 1 0 6 2 0 0 2 ]) $ First we do the eigenvalue~$2$. Computation of the powers of $T-2I$, and of the null spaces and nullities, is routine. (Recall from our convention of taking $T$ to represent a transformation $t: ℂ^3 → ℂ^3$ with respect to the standard basis.)    $ p $ $ (T-2I)^p $ νllspace{(t-2)^p} $ nullity  $ 1 $ matrixvenlarge{([ 0 0 1 0 4 2 0 0 0 ])} $ {matrixvenlarge{{[x 0 0]} such that x in ℂ} $ $1$ $ 2 $ matrixvenlarge{([ 0 0 0 0 16 8 0 0 0 ])} $ {matrixvenlarge{{[x -z/2 z]} such that x,z in ℂ} $ $2$ $ 3 $ matrixvenlarge{([ 0 0 0 0 64 32 0 0 0 ])} --same-- --same--   So the generalized null space $general nullspace(t-2)$ has dimension two. We know that the restriction of $t-2$ is nilpotent on this subspace. From the way that the nullities grow we know that the action of $t-2$ on a string basis is $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦0$. Thus we can represent the restriction in the canonical form $ N_2= ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) =Representation of (t-2)  B_2=sequence{[1 1 -2], [-2 0 0]} $ (other choices of basis are possible). Consequently, the action of the restriction of $t$ to $general nullspace(t-2)$ is represented by this matrix. $ J_2=N_2+2I=Representation of (t)= ([ 2 0 1 2 ]) $  The second eigenvalue is $6$. Its computations are easier. Because the power of $x-6$ in the characteristic polynomial is one, the restriction of $t-6$ to $general nullspace(t-6)$ must be nilpotent, of index one (it can't be of index less than one and since $x-6$ is a factor of the characteristic polynomial with the exponent one it can't be of index more than one either). Its action on a string basis must be $vec(β)_3↦0$ and since it is the zero map, its canonical form $N_6$ is the $N by N$ zero matrix. Consequently, the canonical form $J_6$ for the action of $t$ on $general nullspace(t-6)$ is the $N by N$ matrix with the single entry $6$. For the basis we can use any nonzero vector from the generalized null space. $ B_6=[0 1 0] $  Taken together, these two give that the Jordan form of $ T $ is $ Representation of (t)= ([ 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 6 ]) $ where $ B $ is the concatenation of $B_2$ and $B_6$.   For example As a contrast with the prior example, this matrix $ T= ([ 2 2 1 0 6 2 0 0 2 ]) $ has the same characteristic polynomial $ (x-2)^2(x-6) $, but here    $ p $ (T-6I)^p $ νllspace{(t-6)^p} $ nullity $ 1 $ matrixvenlarge{([ -4 3 1 0 0 2 0 0 -4 ])} $ {matrixvenlarge{{[x (4/3)x 0]} such that x in ℂ} $ $1$ $ 2 $ matrixvenlarge{([ 16 -12 -2 0 0 -8 0 0 16 ])} --same-- ---   the action of $t-2$ is stable after only one application- the restriction of $t-2$ to $general nullspace(t-2)$ is nilpotent of index one. The restriction of $t-2$ to the generalized null space acts on a string basis via the two strings $vec(β)_1↦0$ and $vec(β)_2↦0$. We have this Jordan block associated with the eigenvalue~$2$. $ J_2= ([ 2 0 0 2 ]) $  So the contrast with the prior example is that while the characteristic polynomial tells us to look at the action of $t-2$ on its generalized null space, the characteristic polynomial does not completely describe $t-2$'s action. We must do some computations to find that the minimal polynomial is $ (x-2)(x-6) $.  For the eigenvalue $6$ the arguments for the second eigenvalue of the prior example apply again. The restriction of $t-6$ to $general nullspace(t-6)$ is nilpotent of index one. Thus $t-6$'s canonical form $N_6$ is the $N by N$ zero matrix, and the associated Jordan block $J_6$ is the $N by N$ matrix with entry $6$.      Therefore the Jordan form for $T$ is a diagonal matrix. $ Representation of (t)= ([ 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6 ])  B=B_2{B_6} =sequence{[1 0 0], [0 1 -2], [2 4 0]} $ (Checking that the third vector in $B$ is in the null space of $t-6$ is routine.)   For example A bit of computing with $ T= ([ -1 4 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 -4 -1 0 0 3 -9 -4 2 -1 1 5 4 1 4 ]) $ shows that its characteristic polynomial is $ (x-3)^3(x+1)^2 $.

A similar calculation for the other eigenvalue    $ p $ $ (T+1I)^p $ νllspace{(t+1)^p} $ nullity  $ 1 $ matrixvenlarge{([ 0 4 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 -4 0 0 0 3 -9 -4 3 -1 1 5 4 1 5 ])} $ {matrixvenlarge{{colvec{{-(u+v) 0 -v u v}} such that u,v in ℂ} $ $2$ $ 2 $ matrixvenlarge{([ 0 16 0 0 0 0 16 0 0 0 0 -16 0 0 0 8 -40 -16 8 -8 8 24 16 8 24 ])} --same-- --same--   gives that the restriction of $t+1$ to its generalized null space acts on a string basis via the two separate strings $vec(β)_4↦0$ and $vec(β)_5↦0$.  Therefore $ T $ is similar to this Jordan form matrix. $ ([ -1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 ]) $         Do the check for .  We must check that $ ([ 3 0 1 3 ]) = N+3I=PTP^{-1} = ([ 1/2 1/2 -1/4 1/4 ]) ([ 2 -1 1 4 ]) ([ 1 -2 1 2 ]) $ That calculation is easy.   Each matrix is in Jordan form. State its characteristic polynomial and its minimal polynomial.   $([ 3 0 1 3 ])$  $([ -1 0 0 -1 ])$  $([ 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 -1/2 ])$  $([ 3 0 0 1 3 0 0 1 3 ])$  $([ 3 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 3 ])$  $([ 4 0 0 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 -4 0 0 0 1 -4 ])$  $([ 5 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 ])$  $([ 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 3 ])$  $([ 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 3 ])$    The characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x-3)^2$ and the minimal polynomial is the same. The characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x+1)^2$. The minimal polynomial is $m(x)=x+1$. The characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x+(1/2))(x-2)^2$ and the minimal polynomial is the same. The characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x-3)^3$ The minimal polynomial is the same. The characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x-3)^4$. The minimal polynomial is $m(x)=(x-3)^2$. The characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x+4)^2(x-4)^2$ and the minimal polynomial is the same. The characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x-2)^2(x-3)(x-5)$ and the minimal polynomial is $m(x)=(x-2)(x-3)(x-5)$. The characteristic polynomial is $c(x)=(x-2)^2(x-3)(x-5)$ and the minimal polynomial is the same.    Find the Jordan form from the given data.  The matrix $ T $ is $ N by N $ with the single eigenvalue $3$. The nullities of the powers are: $ T-3I $ has nullity two, $ (T-3I)^2 $ has nullity three, $ (T-3I)^3 $ has nullity four, and $ (T-3I)^4 $ has nullity five. The matrix $ S $ is $ N by N $ with two eigenvalues. For the eigenvalue $2$ the nullities are: $ S-2I $ has nullity two, and $ (S-2I)^2 $ has nullity four. For the eigenvalue $-1$ the nullities are: $ S+1I $ has nullity one.    The transformation $t-3$ is nilpotent (that is, $general nullspace(t-3)$ is the entire space) and it acts on a string basis via two strings, $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3 ↦vec(β)_4↦0$ and $vec(β)_5↦0$. Consequently, $t-3$ can be represented in this canonical form. $ N_3= ([ 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]) $ and therefore $T$ is similar to this canonical form matrix. $ J_3=N_3+3I= ([ 3 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 ]) $ The restriction of the transformation $s+1$ is nilpotent on the subspace $general nullspace(s+1)$, and the action on a string basis is $vec(β)_1↦0$. The restriction of the transformation $s-2$ is nilpotent on the subspace $general nullspace(s-2)$, having the action on a string basis of $vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3↦0$ and $vec(β)_4↦vec(β)_5↦0$. Consequently the Jordan form is this. $ ([ -1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 ]) $    Find the change of basis matrices for each example.       For each, because many choices of basis are possible, many other answers are possible. Of course, the calculation to check if an answer gives that $PTP^{-1}$ is in Jordan form is the arbiter of what's correct.  Here is the arrow diagram. $  ℂ^3_{wrt(\stdbasis_3)} → (T) ℂ^3_{wrt(\stdbasis_3)} @VI V PV @VI V PV ℂ^3_{wrt(B)} → (J) ℂ^3_{wrt(B)}  $ The matrix to move from the lower left to the upper left is this. $ P^{-1}=[(Representation of (I)])^{-1} =Representation of (I) =([ 1 -2 0 1 0 1 -2 0 0 ]) $ The matrix $P$ to move from the upper right to the lower right is the inverse of $P^{-1}$. We want this matrix and its inverse. $ P^{-1}= ([ 1 0 3 0 1 4 0 -2 0 ]) $ The concatenation of these bases for the generalized null spaces will do for the basis for the entire space. $ B_{-1}=sequence{[-1 0 0 1 0], [-1 0 -1 0 1]}  B_3=sequence{[1 1 -1 0 0], [0 0 0 -2 2], [-1 -1 1 2 0]} $ The change of basis matrices are this one and its inverse. $ P^{-1}= ([ -1 -1 1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 -1 0 -1 -1 0 1 1 0 0 -2 2 0 1 0 2 0 ]) $    Find the Jordan form and a Jordan basis for each matrix.   $ ([ -10 4 -25 10 ]) $  $ ([ 5 -4 9 -7 ]) $  $ ([ 4 0 0 2 1 3 5 0 4 ]) $  $ ([ 5 4 3 -1 0 -3 1 -2 1 ]) $  $ ([ 9 7 3 -9 -7 -4 4 4 4 ]) $  $ ([ 2 2 -1 -1 -1 1 -1 -2 2 ]) $  $ ([ 7 1 2 2 1 4 -1 -1 -2 1 5 -1 1 1 2 8 ]) $   The general procedure is to factor the characteristic polynomial $c(x)=(x-λ_1)^{p_1}(x-λ_2)^{p_2}·s $ to get the eigenvalues $λ_1$, $λ_2$, etc. Then, for each $λ_i$ we find a string basis for the action of the transformation $t-λ_i$ when restricted to $general nullspace(t-λ_i)$, by computing the powers of the matrix $T-λ_iI$ and finding the associated null spaces, until these null spaces settle down (do not change), at which point we have the generalized null space. The dimensions of those null spaces (the nullities) tell us the action of $t-λ_i$ on a string basis for the generalized null space, and so we can write the pattern of subdiagonal ones to have $N_{λ_i}$. From this matrix, the Jordan block $J_{λ_i}$ associated with $λ_i$ is immediate $J_{λ_i}=N_{λ_i}+λ_iI$. Finally, after we have done this for each eigenvalue, we put them together into the canonical form.  The characteristic polynomial of this matrix is $c(x)=(-10-x)(10-x)+100=x^2$, so it has only the single eigenvalue $λ=0$.    {power~$p$} $(T+0· I)^p$νllspace{(t-0)^p}$ nullity  $1$ matrixvenlarge{([ -10 4 -25 10 ])} ${matrixvenlarge{{[2y/5 y]} such that y in ℂ}$ $1$ $2$ matrixvenlarge{([ 0 0 0 0 ])} $ ℂ^2$ $2$   (Thus, this transformation is nilpotent: $general nullspace(t-0)$ is the entire space). From the nullities we know that $t$'s action on a string basis is $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦0$. This is the canonical form matrix for the action of $t-0$ on $general nullspace(t-0)= ℂ^2$ $ N_0= ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $ and this is the Jordan form of the matrix. $ J_0=N_0+0· I= ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $ Note that if a matrix is nilpotent then its canonical form equals its Jordan form.  We can find such a string basis using the techniques of the prior section. $ B=sequence{[1 0], [-10 -25]} $ We took the first basis vector so that it is in the null space of $t^2$ but is not in the null space of $t$. The second basis vector is the image of the first under $t$. The characteristic polynomial of this matrix is $ c(x)=(x+1)^2 $, so it is a single-eigenvalue matrix. (That is, the generalized null space of $t+1$ is the entire space.) We have $ νllspace{t+1}={[2y/3 y] such that y in ℂ}  νllspace{(t+1)^2}= ℂ^2 $ and so the action of $t+1$ on an associated string basis is $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦0$. Thus, $ N_{-1} = ([ 0 0 1 0 ]) $ the Jordan form of T is $ J_{-1}=N_{-1}+-1· I = ([ -1 0 1 -1 ]) $ and choosing vectors from the above null spaces gives this string basis (other choices are possible). $ B=sequence{[1 0], [6 9]} $ The characteristic polynomial $ c(x)=(1-x)(4-x)^2=-1· (x-1)(x-4)^2 $ has two roots and they are the eigenvalues $λ_1=1$ and $λ_2=4$.  We handle the two eigenvalues separately. For $λ_1$, the calculation of the powers of $T-1I$ yields $ νllspace{t-1}={[0 y 0] such that y in ℂ} $ and the null space of $(t-1)^2$ is the same. Thus this set is the generalized null space $general nullspace(t-1)$. The nullities show that the action of the restriction of $t-1$ to the generalized null space on a string basis is $vec(β)_1↦0$.  A similar calculation for $λ_2=4$ gives these null spaces. $ νllspace{t-4}={[0 z z] such that z in ℂ}  νllspace{(t-4)^2}={[y-z y z] such that y,z in ℂ} $ (The null space of $(t-4)^3$ is the same, as it must be because the power of the term associated with $λ_2=4$ in the characteristic polynomial is two, and so the restriction of $t-2$ to the generalized null space $general nullspace(t-2)$ is nilpotent of index at most two- it takes at most two applications of $t-2$ for the null space to settle down.) The pattern of how the nullities rise tells us that the action of $t-4$ on an associated string basis for $general nullspace(t-4)$ is $vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3↦0$.  Putting the information for the two eigenvalues together gives the Jordan form of the transformation $t$. $ ([ 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 4 ]) $ We can take elements of the null spaces to get an appropriate basis. $ B=cat{B_{1}}{B_4}= sequence{[0 1 0], [1 0 1], [0 5 5]} $ The characteristic polynomial is $ c(x)=(-2-x)(4-x)^2=-1· (x+2)(x-4)^2 $.  For the eigenvalue $λ_{-2}$, calculation of the powers of $T+2I$ yields this. $ νllspace{t+2}={[z z z] such that z in ℂ} $ The null space of $(t+2)^2$ is the same, and so this is the generalized null space $general nullspace(t+2)$. Thus the action of the restriction of $t+2$ to $general nullspace(t+2)$ on an associated string basis is $vec(β)_1↦0$.  For $λ_2=4$, computing the powers of $T-4I$ yields $ νllspace{t-4}={[z -z z] such that z in ℂ}  νllspace{(t-4)^2}={[x -z z] such that x,z in ℂ} $ and so the action of $t-4$ on a string basis for $general nullspace(t-4)$ is $vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3↦0$.  Therefore the Jordan form is $ ([ -2 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 4 ]) $ and a suitable basis is this. $ B=cat{B_{-2}}{B_4}= sequence{[1 1 1], [0 -1 1], [-1 1 -1]} $ The characteristic polynomial of this matrix is $ c(x)=(2-x)^3=-1· (x-2)^3 $. This matrix has only a single eigenvalue, $λ=2$. By finding the powers of $T-2I$ we have $ νllspace{t-2}={[-y y 0] such that y in ℂ}  νllspace{(t-2)^2}={[-y-(1/2)z y z] such that y,z in ℂ} $ and $ νllspace{(t-2)^3}= ℂ^3 $ and so the action of $t-2$ on an associated string basis is $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦ vec(β)_3↦0$. The Jordan form is this $ ([ 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 ]) $ and one choice of basis is this. $ B=sequence{[0 1 0], [7 -9 4], [-2 2 0]} $ The characteristic polynomial $ c(x)=(1-x)^3=-(x-1)^3 $ has only a single root, so the matrix has only a single eigenvalue $λ=1$. Finding the powers of $T-1I$ and calculating the null spaces $ νllspace{t-1}={[-2y+z y z] such that y,z in ℂ}  νllspace{(t-1)^2}= ℂ^3 $ shows that the action of the nilpotent map $t-1$ on a string basis is $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦0$ and $vec(β)_3↦0$. Therefore the Jordan form is $ J= ([ 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 ]) $ and an appropriate basis (a string basis associated with $t-1$) is this. $ B=sequence{[0 1 0], [2 -2 -2], [1 0 1]} $ The characteristic polynomial is a bit large for by-hand calculation, but just manageable $ c(x)=x^4-24x^3+216x^2-864x+1296=(x-6)^4 $. This is a single-eigenvalue map, so the transformation $t-6$ is nilpotent. The null spaces $ νllspace{t-6}={[-z-w -z-w z w] such that z,w in ℂ}  νllspace{(t-6)^2}={[x -z-w z w] such that x,z,w in ℂ} $ and $ νllspace{(t-6)^3}= ℂ^4 $ and the nullities show that the action of $t-6$ on a string basis is $vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦ vec(β)_3↦0$ and $vec(β)_4↦0$. The Jordan form is $ ([ 6 0 0 0 1 6 0 0 0 1 6 0 0 0 0 6 ]) $ and finding a suitable string basis is routine. $ B=sequence{[0 0 0 1], [2 -1 -1 2], [3 3 -6 3], [-1 -1 1 0]} $    Find all possible Jordan forms of a transformation with characteristic polynomial $ (x-1)^2(x+2)^2 $.  There are two eigenvalues, $λ_1=-2$ and $λ_2=1$.

The restriction of $t+2$ to $general nullspace(t+2)$ can have only the action $vec(β)_1↦0$.

The action of $t+1$ on a string basis for $general nullspace(t+1)$ must be $vec(β)_1↦0$. Because of the power of $ x-2 $ in the minimal polynomial, a string basis for $t-2$ has length two and so the action of $ t-2 $ on $ general nullspace(t-2) $ must be of this form. $ $[t] vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3↦0 vec(β)_4↦0 $ $ Therefore there is only one Jordan form that is possible. $ ([ -1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 2 ]) $   Find all possible Jordan forms of a transformation with characteristic polynomial $ (x-2)^4(x+1) $ and minimal polynomial $ (x-2)^2(x+1) $.  There are two possible Jordan forms. The action of $t+1$ on a string basis for $general nullspace(t+1)$ must be $vec(β)_1↦0$. There are two actions for $t-2$ on a string basis for $general nullspace(t-2)$ that are possible with this characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial. $ $[t] vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3↦0 vec(β)_4↦vec(β)_5↦0 $  $[t] vec(β)_2↦vec(β)_3↦0 vec(β)_4↦0 vec(β)_5↦0 $ $ The resulting Jordan form matrices are these. $ ([ -1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 ])  ([ -1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 ]) $  Diagonalize these.  $ ([ 1 1 0 0 ]) $ $ ([ 0 1 1 0 ]) $    The characteristic polynomial is $ c(x)=x(x-1) $. For $λ_1=0$ we have $ νllspace{t-0}={[-y y] such that y in ℂ } $ (of course, the null space of $t^2$ is the same). For $λ_2=1$, $ νllspace{t-1}={[x 0] such that x in ℂ } $ (and the null space of $(t-1)^2$ is the same). We can take this basis $ B=[1 -1],[1 0] $ to get the diagonalization. $ ([ 1 1 -1 0 ])^{-1} ([ 1 1 0 0 ]) ([ 1 1 -1 0 ]) = ([ 0 0 0 1 ]) $ The characteristic polynomial is $ c(x)=x^2-1=(x+1)(x-1) $.

We can take this basis $ B=[1 -1],[1 1] $ to get a diagonalization. $ ([ 1 1 1 -1 ])^{-1} ([ 0 1 1 0 ]) ([ 1 1 -1 1 ]) = ([ -1 0 0 1 ]) $    Find the Jordan matrix representing the differentiation operator on $ polyspace(_3) $.  The transformation $d/dx: polyspace(_3) → polyspace(_3)$ is nilpotent. Its action on the basis $ B=x^3,3x^2,6x,6 $ is $x^3↦ 3x^2↦ 6x↦ 6↦ 0$. Its Jordan form is its canonical form as a nilpotent matrix. $ J= ([ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ]) $   Decide if these two are similar. $ ([ 1 -1 4 -3 ])  ([ -1 0 1 -1 ]) $  Yes. Each has the characteristic polynomial $(x+1)^2$. Calculations of the powers of $T_1+1· I$ and $T_2+1· I$ gives these two. $ νllspace{t_1+1}={[y/2 y] such that y in ℂ}  νllspace{t_2+1}={[0 y] such that y in ℂ} $ (Of course, for each the null space of the square is the entire space.) The way that the nullities rise shows that each is similar to this Jordan form matrix $ ([ -1 0 1 -1 ]) $ and they are therefore similar to each other.   Find the Jordan form of this matrix. $ ([ 0 -1 1 0 ]) $ Also give a Jordan basis.  Its characteristic polynomial is $ c(x)=x^2+1 $ which has complex roots $ x^2+1=(x+i)(x-i) $. Because the roots are distinct, the matrix is diagonalizable and its Jordan form is that diagonal matrix. $ ([ -i 0 0 i ]) $ To find an associated basis we compute the null spaces. $ νllspace{t+i}={[-iy y] such that y in ℂ}  νllspace{t-i}={[iy y] such that y in ℂ} $ For instance, $ T+i· I= ([ i -1 1 i ]) $ and so we get a description of the null space of $t+i$ by solving this linear system. $ $ ix - y = 0 x + iy = 0 $ for step $iρ_1+ρ_2$ $ ix - y = 0 0 = 0 $ $ (To change the relation $ix=y$ so that the leading variable $x$ is expressed in terms of the free variable $y$, we can multiply both sides by $-i$.)  As a result, one such basis is this. $ B=sequence{[-i 1], [i 1]} $   How many similarity classes are there for $ N by N $ matrices whose only eigenvalues are $ -3 $ and $ 4 $?  We can count the possible classes by counting the possible canonical representatives, that is, the possible Jordan form matrices. The characteristic polynomial must be either $c_1(x)=(x+3)^2(x-4)$ or $c_2(x)=(x+3)(x-4)^2$. In the $c_1$ case there are two possible actions of $t+3$ on a string basis for $general nullspace(t+3)$. $ vec(β)_1↦vec(β)_2↦ 0  $[t] vec(β)_1↦0 vec(β)_2↦0 $ $ There are two associated Jordan form matrices. $ ([ -3 0 0 1 -3 0 0 0 4 ])  ([ -3 0 0 0 -3 0 0 0 4 ]) $ Similarly there are two Jordan form matrices that could arise out of $c_2$. $ ([ -3 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 4 ])  ([ -3 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 ]) $ So in total there are four possible Jordan forms.   Prove that a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial has only linear factors.  Jordan form is unique. A diagonal matrix is in Jordan form. Thus the Jordan form of a diagonalizable matrix is its diagonalization. If the minimal polynomial has factors to some power higher than one then the Jordan form has subdiagonal $ 1 $'s, and so is not diagonal.   Give an example of a linear transformation on a vector space that has no non-trivial invariant subspaces.  One example is the transformation of $ ℂ $ that sends $ x $ to $ -x $.   Show that a subspace is $ t-λ_1 $ invariant if and only if it is $ t-λ_2 $ invariant.  Apply twice; the subspace is $t-λ_1$~invariant if and only if it is $t$~invariant, which in turn holds if and only if it is $t-λ_2$~invariant.   Prove or disprove: two $ N by N $ matrices are similar if and only if they have the same characteristic and minimal polynomials.  False; these two $N by N$ matrices each have $c(x)=(x-3)^4$ and $m(x)=(x-3)^2$. $ ([ 3 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 3 ])  ([ 3 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 ]) $   The trace of a square matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries.  Find the formula for the characteristic polynomial of a $N by N$ matrix. Show that trace is invariant under similarity, and so we can sensibly speak of the `trace of a map'. (Hint: see the prior item.) Is trace invariant under matrix equivalence? Show that the trace of a map is the sum of its eigenvalues (counting multiplicities). Show that the trace of a nilpotent map is zero. Does the converse hold?    The characteristic polynomial is this. $ ([ a-x b c d-x ]) =(a-x)(d-x)-bc=ad-(a+d)x+x^2-bc =x^2-(a+d)x+(ad-bc) $ Note that the determinant appears as the constant term. Recall that the characteristic polynomial $ determinant(T-xI) $ is invariant under similarity. Use the permutation expansion formula to show that the trace is the negative of the coefficient of $ x^{n-1} $. No, there are matrices $T$ and $S$ that are equivalent $S=PTQ$ (for some nonsingular $P$ and $Q$) but that have different traces. An easy example is this. $ PTQ= ([ 2 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) ([ 1 0 0 1 ]) = ([ 2 0 0 1 ]) $ Even easier examples using $N by N$ matrices are possible. Put the matrix in Jordan form. By the first item, the trace is unchanged. The first part is easy; use the third item. The converse does not hold:~this matrix $ ([ 1 0 0 -1 ]) $ has a trace of zero but is not nilpotent.    To use def:invariant to check whether a subspace is $t$~invariant, we seemingly have to check all of the infinitely many vectors in a (nontrivial) subspace to see if they satisfy the condition. Prove that a subspace is $ t $~invariant if and only if its subbasis has the property that for all of its elements, $t(vec(β))$ is in the subspace.  Suppose that $ B_M $ is a basis for a subspace $ M $ of some vector space. Implication one way is clear; if $ M $ is $ t $ invariant then in particular, if $ vec(m) in B_M $ then $ t(vec(m)) in M $. For the other implication, let $ B_M=sequence{vec(β)_1,...,vec(β)_q} $ and note that $ t(vec(m))=t(m_1vec(β)_1+...+m_qvec(β)_q) =m_1t(vec(β)_1)+...+m_qt(vec(β)_q) $ is in $ M $ as any subspace is closed under linear combinations.   Is $ t $ invariance preserved under intersection? Under union? Complementation? Sums of subspaces?  Yes, the intersection of $t$ invariant subspaces is $t$~invariant. Assume that $ M $ and $ N $ are $ t $ invariant. If $ vec(v) in M intersection N $ then $ t(vec(v)) in M $ by the invariance of $ M $ and $ t(vec(v)) in N $ by the invariance of $ N $.  Of course, the union of two subspaces need not be a subspace (remember that the $x$- and $y$-axes are subspaces of the plane $ ℝ^2$ but the union of the two axes fails to be closed under vector addition; for instance it does not contain $vec(e)_1+vec(e)_2$.) However, the union of invariant subsets is an invariant subset; if $ vec(v) in M∪ N $ then $ vec(v) in M $ or $ vec(v) in N $ so $ t(vec(v)) in M $ or $ t(vec(v)) in N $.  No, the complement of an invariant subspace need not be invariant. Consider the subspace $ {[x 0] such that x in ℂ} $ of $ ℂ^2 $ under the zero transformation.  Yes, the sum of two invariant subspaces is invariant. The check is easy.   Give a way to order the Jordan blocks if some of the eigenvalues are complex numbers. That is, suggest a reasonable ordering for the complex numbers.  One such ordering is the dictionary ordering. Order by the real component first, then by the coefficient of $ i $. For instance, $ 3+2i<4+1i $ but $ 4+1i<4+2i $.   Let $ polyspace(_j)( ℝ) $ be the vector space over the reals of degree $ j $ polynomials. Show that if $ jle(k) $ then $ polyspace(_j)( ℝ) $ is an invariant subspace of $ polyspace(_k)( ℝ) $ under the differentiation operator. In $ polyspace(_7)( ℝ) $, does any of $ polyspace(_0)( ℝ) $, ..., $ polyspace(_6)( ℝ) $ have an invariant complement?  The first half is easy- the derivative of any real polynomial is a real polynomial of lower degree. The answer to the second half is `no'; any complement of $ polyspace(_j)( ℝ) $ must include a polynomial of degree $ j+1 $, and the derivative of that polynomial is in $ polyspace(_j)( ℝ)$.   In $ polyspace(_n)( ℝ) $, the vector space (over the reals) of degree $ n $ polynomials, $ 𝓔= {p(x) inpolyspace(_n)( ℝ) such that p(-x)=p(x) { for all x} $ and $ 𝒪= {p(x) inpolyspace(_n)( ℝ) such that p(-x)=-p(x) { for all x} $ are the even and the odd polynomials; $ p(x)=x^2 $ is even while $ p(x)=x^3 $ is odd. Show that they are subspaces. Are they complementary? Are they invariant under the differentiation transformation?  For the first half, show that each is a subspace and then observe that any polynomial can be uniquely written as the sum of even-powered and odd-powered terms (the zero polynomial is both). The answer to the second half is `no': $ x^2 $ is even while $ 2x $ is odd.   says that if $ M $ and $ N $ are invariant complements then $ t $ has a representation in the given block form (with respect to the same ending as starting basis, of course). Does the implication reverse?  Yes. If $ Representation of (t) $ has the given block form, take $ B_M $ to be the first $ j $ vectors of $ B $, where $ J $ is the $ N by j $ upper left submatrix. Take $ B_N $ to be the remaining $ k $ vectors in $ B $. Let $ M $ and $ N $ be the spans of $ B_M $ and $ B_N $. Clearly $ M $ and $ N $ are complementary. To see $ M $ is invariant ($ N $ works the same way), represent any $ vec(m) in M $ with respect to $ B $, note the last $ k $ components are zeroes, and multiply by the given block matrix. The final $ k $ components of the result are zeroes, so that result is again in $ M $.   A matrix $ S $ is the square root of another $ T $ if $ S^2=T $. Show that any nonsingular matrix has a square root.  Put the matrix in Jordan form. By non-singularity, there are no zero eigenvalues on the diagonal. Ape this example: $ ([ 9 0 0 1 9 0 0 0 4 ]) = ([ 3 0 0 1/6 3 0 0 0 2 ])^2 $ to construct a square root. Show that it holds up under similarity: if $ S^2=T $ then $ (PSP^{-1})(PSP^{-1})=PTP^{-1} $.            In applications matrices can be large. Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors by finding and solving the characteristic polynomial is impractical, too slow and too error-prone. Some techniques avoid the characteristic polynomial. Here we shall see a method that is suitable for large matrices that are sparse , meaning that the great majority of the entries are zero.  Suppose that the $N by N$ matrix $T$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues $λ_1$, $λ_2$, ..., $λ_n$. Then $ ℂ^n$ has a basis made of the associated eigenvectors $sequence{vec(ζ)_1,...,vec(ζ)_n}$. For any $vec(v) in ℂ^n$, writing $vec(v)=c_1vec(ζ)_1+...+c_nvec(ζ)_n$ and iterating $T$ on $vec(v)$ gives these. $ Tvec(v) =c_1λ_1vec(ζ)_1+c_2λ_2vec(ζ)_2+ ...+c_nλ_nvec(ζ)_n T^2vec(v) =c_1λ_1^2vec(ζ)_1+c_2λ_2^2vec(ζ)_2+ ...+c_nλ_n^2vec(ζ)_n T^3vec(v) =c_1λ_1^3vec(ζ)_1+c_2λ_2^3vec(ζ)_2+ ...+c_nλ_n^3vec(ζ)_n ... T^kvec(v) =c_1λ_1^kvec(ζ)_1+c_2λ_2^kvec(ζ)_2+ ...+c_nλ_n^kvec(ζ)_n $ Assuming that $|λ_1|$ is the largest and dividing through $ frac{T^kvec(v)}{λ_1^k} =c_1vec(ζ)_1+c_2(λ_2^k/λ_1^k)vec(ζ)_2+ ...+c_n(λ_n^k/λ_1^k)vec(ζ)_n $ shows that as $k$ gets larger the fractions go to zero and so $λ_1$'s term will dominate the expression and that expression has a limit of $c_1vec(ζ)_1$.  Thus if $c_1 ≠ 0$, as $k$ increases the vectors $T^kvec(v)$ will tend toward the direction of the eigenvectors associated with the dominant eigenvalue. Consequently, the ratios of the vector lengths $|T^{k}vec(v)|/|T^{k-1}vec(v)|$ tend to that dominant eigenvalue.  For example, the eigenvalues of the matrix $ T=([ 3 0 8 -1 ]) $ are $3$ and $-1$. If $vec(v)$ has the components $1$ and $1$ then iterating gives this.   $vec(v)$Tvec(v)$T^2vec(v)$ $·s$T^9vec(v)$T^{10}vec(v)$ $[1 1]$ $[3 7]$ $[9 17]$ $·s$ $[19 ,683 39 ,367]$ $[59 ,049 118 ,097]$   The ratio between the lengths of the last two is $2.9999$.  We note two implementation issues. First, instead of finding the powers of $T$ and applying them to $vec(v)$, we will compute $vec(v)_1$ as $Tvec(v)$ and then compute $vec(v)_2$ as $Tvec(v)_1$, etc. (that is, we do not separately calculate $T^2$, $T^3$, ...). We can quickly do these matrix-vector products even if $T$ is large, provided that it is sparse. The second issue is that to avoid generating numbers that are so large that they overflow our computer's capability, we can normalize the $vec(v)_i$'s at each step. For instance, we can divide each $vec(v)_i$ by its length (other possibilities are to divide it by its largest component, or simply by its first component). We thus implement this method by generating $ vec(w)_0 =vec(v)_0/|vec(v)_0| vec(v)_1 =Tvec(w)_0 vec(w)_1 =vec(v)_1/|vec(v)_1| vec(v)_2 =Tvec(w)_2 ... vec(w)_{k-1} =vec(v)_{k-1}/|vec(v)_{k-1}| vec(v)_k =Tvec(w)_k $ until we are satisfied. Then $vec(v)_k$ is an approximation of an eigenvector, and the approximation of the dominant eigenvalue is the ratio $(Tdot product of vec(v)_k)/(vec(v)_kdot product of vec(v)_k) ≈ (λ_1vec(v)_k·vec(v)_k)/(vec(v)_kdot product of vec(v)_k) =λ_1$.   One way that we could be `satisfied' is to iterate until our approximation of the eigenvalue settles down. We could decide for instance to stop the iteration process not after some fixed number of steps, but instead when $|vec(v)_k|$ differs from $|vec(v)_{k-1}|$ by less than one percent, or when they agree up to the second significant digit.  The rate of convergence is determined by the rate at which the powers of $|λ_2/λ_1|$ go to zero, where $λ_2$ is the eigenvalue of second largest length. If that ratio is much less than one then convergence is fast but if it is only slightly less than one then convergence can be quite slow. Consequently, the method of powers is not the most commonly used way of finding eigenvalues (although it is the simplest one, which is why it is here). Instead, there are a variety of methods that generally work by first replacing the given matrix $T$ with another that is similar to it and so has the same eigenvalues, but is in some reduced form such as tridiagonal form , where the only nonzero entries are on the diagonal, or just above or below it. Then special case techniques can find the eigenvalues. Once we know the eigenvalues then we can easily compute the eigenvectors of $T$. These other methods are outside of our scope. A good reference is      Use ten iterations to estimate the largest eigenvalue of these matrices, starting from the vector with components $1$ and $2$. Compare the answer with the one obtained by solving the characteristic equation.  $([ 1 5 0 4 ])$ $([ 3 2 -1 0 ])$    By eye, we see that the largest eigenvalue is $4$. Sage gives this.  sage: def eigen(M,v,num_loops=10): ....: for p in range(num_loops): ....: v_normalized = (1/v.norm())*v ....: v = M*v ....: return v ....: sage: M = matrix(RDF, [[1,5], [0,4]]) sage: v = vector(RDF, [1, 2]) sage: v = eigen(M,v) sage: (M*v).dot_product(v)/v.dot_product(v) 4.00000147259  A simple calculation shows that the largest eigenvalue is~$2$.

How many iterations does it take? Are the answers significantly different?

At each step, normalize by dividing each vector by its length. How many iterations does it take? Are the answers significantly different?    Sage gets this, where is defined above.  sage: M = matrix(RDF, [[4,0,1], [-2,1,0], [-2,0,1]]) sage: v = vector(RDF, [1, 2, 3]) sage: v,v_prior,dex = eigen_by_iter(M,v) sage: (M*v).dot_product(v)/v.dot_product(v) 3.05460392934 sage: dex 8  With this setup,  sage: M = matrix(RDF, [[-1,2,2], [2,2,2], [-3,-6,-6]]) sage: v = vector(RDF, [1, 2, 3])  Sage does not return (use to interrupt the computation). Adding some error checking code to the routine  def eigen_by_iter(M, v, toler=0.01): dex = 0 diff = 10 while abs(diff)>toler: dex = dex+1 if dex>1000: print "oops! probably in some loop: nv=",v,"nv(_next)=",v_next v_next = M*v if (v.norm()==0): print "oops! v is zero" return None if (v_next.norm()==0): print "oops! v_next is zero" return None v_normalized = (1/v.norm())*v v_next_normalized = (1/v_next.norm())*v_next diff = (v_next_normalized-v_normalized).norm() v_prior = v_normalized v = v_next_normalized return v, v_prior, dex  gives this.  oops! probably in some loop: v= (0.707106781187, -1.48029736617e-16, -0.707106781187) v_next= (2.12132034356, -4.4408920985e-16, -2.12132034356) oops! probably in some loop: v= (-0.707106781187, 1.48029736617e-16, 0.707106781187) v_next= (-2.12132034356, 4.4408920985e-16, 2.12132034356) oops! probably in some loop: v= (0.707106781187, -1.48029736617e-16, -0.707106781187) v_next= (2.12132034356, -4.4408920985e-16, -2.12132034356)  So it is circling.    What happens if $c_1=0$? That is, what happens if the initial vector does not to have any component in the direction of the relevant eigenvector?  In theory, this method would produce $λ_2$. In practice, however, rounding errors in the computation introduce components in the direction of $vec(v)_1$, and so the method will still produce $λ_1$, although it may take somewhat longer than it would have taken with a more fortunate choice of initial vector.   How can we adapt the method of powers to find the smallest eigenvalue?  Instead of using $vec(v)_k=Tvec(v)_{k-1}$, use $T^{-1}vec(v)_k=vec(v)_{k-1}$.     This is the code for the computer algebra system Octave that did the calculation above. (It has been lightly edited to remove blank lines, etc.)  >T=[3, 0; 8, -1] T= 3 0 8 -1 >v0=[1; 2] v0= 1 1 >v1=T*v0 v1= 3 7 >v2=T*v1 v2= 9 17 >T9=T**9 T9= 19683 0 39368 -1 >T10=T**10 T10= 59049 0 118096 1 >v9=T9*v0 v9= 19683 39367 >v10=T10*v0 v10= 59049 118096 >norm(v10)/norm(v9) ans=2.9999  Remark. This does not use the full power of Octave; it has built-in functions to automatically apply sophisticated methods to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.                  Imagine a reserve park with animals from a species that we are protecting. The park doesn't have a fence so animals cross the boundary, both from the inside out and from the outside in. Every year, $10\ $1\ find their way in. Can we reach a stable level; are there populations for the park and the rest of the world that will stay constant over time, with the number of animals leaving equal to the number of animals entering?  Let $p_n$ be the year~$n$ population in the park and let $r_n$ be the population in the rest of the world. $ p_{n+1} =.90p_n+.01r_n r_{n+1} =.10p_n+.99r_n $ We have this matrix equation. $ [p_{n+1] r_{n+1}} =([ .90 .01 .10 .99 ]) [p_{n] r_{n}} $ The population will be stable if $p_{n+1}=p_n$ and $r_{n+1}=r_n$ so that the matrix equation $vec(v)_{n+1}=Tvec(v)_{n}$ becomes $vec(v)=Tvec(v)$. We are therefore looking for eigenvectors for $T$ that are associated with the eigenvalue $λ=1$. The equation $0=(λ I-T)vec(v)=(I-T)vec(v)$ is $ ([ 0.10 -0.01 -0.10 0.01 ]) [p r]= [0 0] $ and gives the eigenspace of vectors with the restriction that $p=.1r$. For example, if we start with a park population $p=10000$~animals and a rest of the world population of $r=100000$~animals then every year ten percent of those inside leave the park (this is a thousand animals), and every year one percent of those from the rest of the world enter the park (also a thousand animals). The population is stable, self-sustaining.  Now imagine that we are trying to raise the total world population of this species. We are trying to have the world population grow at $1\ This makes the population level stable in some sense, although it is a dynamic stability, in contrast to the static population level of the $λ=1$ case. The equation $vec(v)_{n+1}=1.01·vec(v)_n=Tvec(v)_{n}$ leads to $((1.01 I-T)vec(v)=0$, which gives this system. $ ([ 0.11 -0.01 -0.10 0.02 ]) [p r]= [0 0] $ This matrix is nonsingular and so the only solution is $p=0$, $r=0$. Thus there is no nontrivial initial population that would lead to a regular annual one percent growth rate in $p$ and $r$.  We can look for the rates that allow an initial population for the park that results in a steady growth behavior. We consider $λvec(v)=Tvec(v)$ and solve for $λ$. $ 0=([ λ-.9 .01 .10 λ-.99 ]) =(λ-.9)(λ-.99)-(.10)(.01) =λ^2-1.89λ+.89 $ We already know that $λ=1$ is one solution of this characteristic equation. The other is $0.89$. Thus there are two ways to have a dynamically stable $p$ and $r$, where the two grow at the same rate despite the leaky park boundaries:~have a world population that is does not grow or shrink, and have a world population that shrinks by $11\  So one way to look at eigenvalues and eigenvectors is that they give a stable state for a system. If the eigenvalue is one then the system is static and if the eigenvalue isn't one then it is a dynamic stability.        For the park discussed above, what should be the initial park population in the case where the populations decline by $11\  The equation $ 0.89I-T = ([ 0.89 0 0 0.89 ]) - ([ .90 .01 .10 .99 ]) = ([ -.01 -.01 -.10 -.10 ]) $ leads to this system. $ ([ -.01 -.01 -.10 -.10 ]) [p r] = [0 0] $\ So the eigenvectors have $p=-r$.   What will happen to the population of the park in the event of a growth in world population of $1\ Will it lag the world growth, or lead it? Assume that the initial park population is ten thousand, and the world population is one hundred thousand, and calculate over a ten year span.  Sage finds this.  sage: M = matrix(RDF, [[0.90,0.01], [0.10,0.99]]) sage: v = vector(RDF, [10000, 100000]) sage: for y in range(10): ....: v[1] = v[1]*(1+.01)^y ....: print "pop vector year",y," is",v ....: v = M*v ....: pop vector year 0 is (10000.0, 100000.0) pop vector year 1 is (10000.0, 101000.0) pop vector year 2 is (10010.0, 103019.899) pop vector year 3 is (10039.19899, 106111.421211) pop vector year 4 is (10096.3933031, 110360.453787) pop vector year 5 is (10190.3585107, 115891.187687) pop vector year 6 is (10330.2345365, 122872.349786) pop vector year 7 is (10525.9345807, 131525.973067) pop vector year 8 is (10788.6008533, 142139.351965) pop vector year 9 is (11131.1342876, 155081.09214)  So inside the park the population grows by about eleven percent while outside the park the population grows by about fifty five percent.   The park discussed above is partially fenced so that now, every year, only $5\ about $1\ find their way in). Under what conditions can the park maintain a stable population now?  The matrix equation $ [p_{n+1] r_{n+1}} = ([ 0.95 0.01 0.05 0.99 ]) [p_n r_n] $ means that to find eigenvalues we want to solve this. $ 0 = ([ λ-0.95 0.01 0.10 λ-0.99 ]) =λ^2-1.94λ-0.9404 $ Sage gives this.  sage: a,b,c = var('a,b,c') sage: qe = (x^2 - 1.94*x -.9404 == 0) sage: print solve(qe, x) [ x == -1/100*sqrt(18813) + 97/100, x == 1/100*sqrt(18813) + 97/100 ] sage: n(-1/100*sqrt(18813) + 97/100) -0.401604899378826 sage: n(1/100*sqrt(18813) + 97/100) 2.34160489937883    Suppose that a species of bird only lives in Canada, the United States, or in Mexico.

This is the recurrence. $ [c_{n+1] u_{n+1} m_{n+1}} = ([ .95 .06 0 .04 .90 .10 .01 .04 .90 ]) [c_n u_n m_n] $ The system $ $ .05c - .06u = 0 -.04c + .10u - .10m = 0 -.01c - .04u + .10m = 0 $ $ has infinitely many solutions.  sage: var('c,u,m') (c, u, m) sage: eqns = [ .05*c-.06*u == 0, ....: -.04*c+.10*u-.10*m == 0, ....: -.01*c-.04*u+.10*m == 0 ] sage: solve(eqns, c,u,m) [[c == 30/13*r1, u == 25/13*r1, m == r1]]                      Imagine that you are looking for the best book on Linear Algebra. You probably would try a web search engine such as Google. These lists pages ranked by importance. The ranking is defined, as Google's founders have said in , that a page is important if other important pages link to it: ``a page can have a high PageRank if there are many pages that point to it, or if there are some pages that point to it and have a high PageRank.'' But isn't that circular- how can they tell whether a page is important without first deciding on the important pages? The answer is to use eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  We will present a simplified version of the Page Rank algorithm. For that we will model the World Wide Web as a collection of pages connected by links. This diagram, from , shows the pages as circles and the links as arrows. Page~$p_1$ has a link to page~$p_2$. Page~$p_2$ has a link to~$p_3$. And $p_3$ has links to $p_1$, $p_2$, and~$p_3$        The key idea is that pages that should be highly ranked if they are cited often by other pages.    That is, we raise the importance of a page~$p_i$ if it is linked-to from page~$p_j$. The increment depends on the importance of the linking page~$p_j$ divided by how many out-links $a_j$ are on that page. $ 𝓘(p_i)=∑_{in-linking pages $p_j$} (𝓘(p_j)/a_j) $ Thus, the importance of $p_1$ equals $1/3$ times the importance of~$p_3$, since the only link to~$p_1$ comes from~$p_3$. Similarly the importance of~$p_2$ is the sum of the importance of~$p_1$ plus $1/3$ times the importance of~$p_3$.  This stores the information. $ ([ 0 0 1/3 0 1 0 1/3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1/3 0 ]) $ The algorithm's inventors describe a way to think about that matrix.  PageRank can be thought of as a model of user behavior. We assume there is a `random surfer' who is given a web page at random and keeps clicking on links, never hitting ``back'' ...{}   The probability that the random surfer visits a page is its PageRank.   Thus, looking at the first row of the matrix, the only way for a random surfer to get to $p_1$ is to have come from~$p_3$. That page has three links so the chance of clicking on $p_1$'s is~$1/3$ times the chance of being on page~$p_3$.  This brings up the question of page~$p_4$. On the Internet many pages are dangling or sink links, without any outbound links. What happens to the random surfer who visits this page? The simplest thing is to imagine that the surfer chooses the next page entirely at random. $ H=([ 0 0 1/3 1/4 1 0 1/3 1/4 0 1 0 1/4 0 0 1/3 1/4 ]) $  We will find vector $vec(𝓘)$ whose components are the importance rankings of each page $𝓘(p_i)$. With this notation, our requirements for the page rank are that $Hvec(𝓘)=vec(𝓘)$. That is, we want an eigenvector of the matrix associated with the eigenvalue~$λ=1$.  Here is Sage's calculation of the eigenvectors (edited to fit the page).  sage: H=matrix([[0,0,1/3,1/4], [1,0,1/3,1/4], [0,1,0,1/4], [0,0,1/3,1/4]]) sage: H.eigenvectors_right() [(1, [(1, 2, 9/4, 1)], 1), (0, [(0, 1, 3, -4)], 1), (-0.3750000000000000? - 0.4389855730355308?*I, [(1, -0.1250000000000000? + 1.316956719106593?*I, -1.875000000000000? - 1.316956719106593?*I, 1)], 1), (-0.3750000000000000? + 0.4389855730355308?*I, [(1, -0.1250000000000000? - 1.316956719106593?*I, -1.875000000000000? + 1.316956719106593?*I, 1)], 1)]  The eigenvector that Sage gives associated with the eigenvalue~$λ=1$ is this. $ [1 2 9/4 1] $ Of course, there are many vectors in that eigenspace. To get a page rank number we normalize to length one.  sage: v=vector([1, 2, 9/4, 1]) sage: v/v.norm() (4/177*sqrt(177), 8/177*sqrt(177), 3/59*sqrt(177), 4/177*sqrt(177)) sage: w=v/v.norm() sage: w.n() (0.300658411201132, 0.601316822402263, 0.676481425202546, 0.300658411201132)  So we rank the first and fourth pages as of equal importance. We rank the second and third pages as much more important than those, and about equal in importance as each other.  We'll add one more refinement. We will allow the surfer to pick a new page at random even if they are not on a dangling page. In this equation it happens with probability~$1-α$. $ G=α·([ 0 0 1/3 1/4 1 0 1/3 1/4 0 1 0 1/4 0 0 1/3 1/4 ]) +(1-α)·([ 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 ]) $ This is the Google matrix .  In practice $α$ is typically between $0.85$ and~$0.99$. Here are the ranks for the four pages with various $α$'s.   $α$ $0.85$0.90$0.95$0.99$ $p_1$0.325$0.317$0.309$0.302$ $p_2$0.602$0.602$0.602$0.601$ $p_3$0.652$0.661$0.669$0.675$ $p_4$0.325$0.317$0.309$0.302$                           The details of the algorithms used by commercial search engines are secret, have many refinements, and also change frequently. But the inventors of Google were gracious enough to outline the basis for their work in . A more current source is . Two additional excellent expositions are and .   A square matrix is stochastic if the sum of the entries in each column is one. The Google matrix is computed by taking a combination $G=α*H+(1-α)*S$ of two stochastic matrices. Show that $G$ must be stochastic.  The sum of the entries in column~$j$ is $∑_i α h_{i,j}+(1-α)s_{i,j} =∑_i α h_{i,j}+∑_i (1-α)s_{i,j} =α∑_i α h_{i,j} +(1-α)∑_i s_{i,j} =α· 1+(1-α)· 1$, which is one.  For this web of pages, the importance of each page should be equal. Verify it for $α=0.85$.

So that page receives a large boost.                 In 1202 Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, posed this problem.  A certain man put a pair of rabbits in a place surrounded on all sides by a wall. How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that pair in a year if it is supposed that every month each pair begets a new pair which from the second month on becomes productive?  This moves past an elementary exponential growth model for populations to include that newborns are not fertile for some period, here a month. However, it retains other simplifying assumptions such as that there is an age after which the rabbits are infertile.  To get next month's total number of pairs we add the number of pairs alive going into next month to the number of pairs that will be newly born next month. The latter equals the number of pairs that will be productive going into next month, which is the number that next month will have been alive for at least two months. $ F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) where $F(0)=0$, $F(1)=1$  $ On the left is a recurrence relation. It gets that name because $F$ recurs in its own defining equation. On the right are the initial conditions. From~($*$) we can compute $F(2)$, $F(3)$, etc., to work up to the answer for Fibonacci's question.   month~$n$ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 pairs~$F(n)$ 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144   We will use linear algebra to get a formula that calculates $F(n)$ without having to first calculate the intermediate values $F(2)$, $F(3)$, etc.  We start by giving ($*$) a matrix formulation. $ [F(n) F(n-1)] = ([ 1 1 1 0 ]) [F(n-1) F(n-2)] where $[F(1) F(0)]=[1 0]$ $ Write $T$ for the matrix and $vec(v)_{n}$ for the vector with components $F(n)$ and $F(n-1)$ so that $vec(v)_{n}=T^{n-1}vec(v)_1$ for $n≥ 1$. If we diagonalize $T$ then we have a fast way to compute its powers:~where $T=PDP^{-1}$ then $T^n=PD^nP^{-1}$ and the $n$-th power of the diagonal matrix $D$ is the diagonal matrix whose entries are the $n$-th powers of the entries of $D$.  The characteristic equation of $T$ is $λ^2-λ-1=0$. The quadratic formula gives its roots as $(1+√{5})/2$ and $(1-√{5})/2$. (These are sometimes called ``golden ratios;'' see .) Diagonalizing gives this. $ ([ 1 1 1 0 ]) =([ frac{1+√{5}}{2} frac{1-√{5}}{2}  1 1 ]) ([ frac{1+√{5}}{2} 0 0 frac{1-√{5}}{2} ]) ([ frac(1){√{5}} -(frac{1-√{5}}{2√{5}}) frac(-1){√{5}} frac{1+√{5}}{2√{5}} ]) $ Introducing the vectors and taking the $n$-th power, we have $ [F(n) F(n-1)] =([ 1 1 1 0 ])^{n-1} [f(1) f(0)] =([ frac{1+√{5}}{2} frac{1-√{5}}{2} 1 1 ]) ([ (frac{1+√{5}}{2})^{n-1} 0 0 (frac{1-√{5}}{2})^{n-1} ]) ([ frac(1){√{5}} -(frac{1-√{5}}{2√{5}}) frac(-1){√{5}} frac{1+√{5}}{2√{5}} ]) [1 0] $ The calculation is ugly but not hard. $ [F(n) F(n-1)] =([ frac{1+√{5}}{2} frac{1-√{5}}{2} 1 1 ]) ([ (frac{1+√{5}}{2})^{n-1} 0 0 (frac{1-√{5}}{2})^{n-1} ]) [ frac{1]{√{5}} -frac(1){√{5}}} =frac(1){√{5}} ([ frac{1+√{5}}{2} frac{1-√{5}}{2} 1 1 ]) [( frac{1+√{5]}{2})^{n-1} -(frac{1-√{5}}{2})^{n-1}} =frac(1){√{5}} [( frac{1+√{5]}{2})^{n} -(frac{1-√{5}}{2})^{n} (frac{1+√{5}}{2})^{n-1} -(frac{1-√{5}}{2})^{n-1}} $ We want the first component. $ F(n)=frac(1){√{5}}[(frac{1+√{5}}{2})^{n} -(frac{1-√{5}}{2})^{n}] $ This formula gives the value of any member of the sequence without having to first find the intermediate values.  Because $(1-√{5})/2≈ -0.618$ has absolute value less than one, its powers go to zero and so the $F(n)$ formula is dominated by its first term. Although we have extended the elementary model of population growth by adding a delay period before the onset of fertility, we nonetheless still get a function that is asymptotically exponential.  In general, a homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order $k$ has this form. $ f(n)=a_{n-1}f(n-1)+a_{n-2}f(n-2)+...+a_{n-k}f(n-k) $ This recurrence relation is homogeneous because it has no constant term, i.e, we can rewrite it as $0=-f(n)+a_{n-1}f(n-1)+a_{n-2}f(n-2)+...+a_{n-k}f(n-k)$. It is of order~$k$ because it uses $k$-many prior terms to calculate $f(n)$. The relation, cimbined with initial conditions giving values for $f(0)$, ..., $f(k-1)$, completely determines a sequence, simply because we can compute $f(n)$ by first computing $f(k)$, $f(k+1)$, etc. As with the Fibonacci case we will find a formula that solves the recurrence, that directly gives $f(n)$  Let $V$ be the set of functions with domain $ ℕ={0,1,2,...}$ and codomain $ ℂ$. (Where convenient we sometimes use the domain $Z^+={1,2,...}$.) This is a vector space under the usual meaning for addition and scalar multiplication, that $f+g$ is the map $x↦ f(x)+g(x)$ and $cf$ is the map $x↦ c· f(x)$.  If we put aside any initial conditions and look only at the recurrence, then there may be many functions satisfying the relation. For example, the Fibonacci recurrence that each value beyond the initial ones is the sum of the prior two is satisfied by the function $L$ whose first few values are $L(0)=2$, $L(1)=1$, $L(2)=3$, $L(3)=4$, and $L(4)=7$.  Fix a homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order~$k$ and consider the subset $S$ of functions satisfying the relation (without initial conditions). This $S$ is a subspace of $V$. It is nonempty because the zero function is a solution, by homogeneity. It is closed under addition because if $f_1$ and $f_2$ are solutions then this holds. $ -(f_1+f_2)(n)+a_{n-1}(f_1+f_2)(n-1)+...+a_{n-k}(f_1+f_2)(n-k) $ =(-f_1(n)+...+a_{n-k}f_1(n-k)) +(-f_2(n)+...+a_{n-k}f_2(n-k)) =0+0=0 $ $ It is also closed under scalar multiplication. $ -(rf_1)(n)+a_{n-1}(rf_1)(n-1)+...+a_{n-k}(rf_1)(n-k) $ =r· (-f_1(n)+...+a_{n-k}f_1(n-k)) =r· 0 =0 $ $ We can find the dimension of $S$. Where $k$ is the order of the recurrence, consider this map from the set of functions~$S$ to the set of $k$-tall vectors. $ f ↦ [f(0) f(1) ... f(k-1)] $ shows that this is linear. Any solution of the recurrence is uniquely determined by the $k$-many initial conditions so this map is one-to-one and onto. Thus it is an isomorphism, and $S$ has dimension $k$.  So we can describe the set of solutions of our linear homogeneous recurrence relation of order~$k$ by finding a basis consisting of $k$-many linearly independent functions. To produce those we give the recurrence a matrix formulation. $ [f(n) f(n-1) ... f(n-k+1)] = ([ a_{n-1} a_{n-2} a_{n-3} ... a_{n-k+1} a_{n-k} 1 0 0 ... 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ... ... ... ... 0 0 0 ... 1 0 ]) [f(n-1) f(n-2) ... f(n-k)] $ Call the matrix~$A$. We want its characteristic function, the determinant of $A-λ I$. The pattern in the $N by N$ case $ ([ a_{n-1}-λ a_{n-2} 1 -λ ]) =λ^2-a_{n-1}λ-a_{n-2} $ and the $N by N$ case $ ([ a_{n-1}-λ a_{n-2} a_{n-3} 1 -λ 0 0 1 -λ ]) =-λ^3+a_{n-1}λ^2+a_{n-2}λ+a_{n-3} $ leads us to expect, and verifies, that this is the characteristic equation. $ 0 = ([ a_{n-1}-λ a_{n-2} a_{n-3} ... a_{n-k+1} a_{n-k} 1 -λ 0 ... 0 0 0 1 -λ 0 0 1 ... ... ... ... 0 0 0 ... 1 -λ ]) =±(-λ^k+a_{n-1}λ^{k-1}+a_{n-2}λ^{k-2} +...+a_{n-k+1}λ+a_{n-k}) $ The $±$ is not relevant to find the roots so we drop it. We say that the polynomial $-λ^k+a_{n-1}λ^{k-1}+a_{n-2}λ^{k-2} +...+a_{n-k+1}λ+a_{n-k}$ is associated with the recurrence relation.  If the characteristic equation has no repeated roots then the matrix is diagonalizable and we can, in theory, get a formula for $f(n)$, as in the Fibonacci case. But because we know that the subspace of solutions has dimension~$k$ we do not need to do the diagonalization calculation, provided that we can exhibit $k$ different linearly independent functions satisfying the relation.  Where $r_1$, $r_2$, ..., $r_k$ are the distinct roots, consider the functions of powers of those roots, $f_{r_1}(n)=r_1^n$ through $f_{r_k}(n)=r_k^n$. shows that each is a solution of the recurrence and that they form a linearly independent set.      So, if the roots of the associated polynomial are distinct, any solution of the relation has the form $f(n)=c_1r_1^n+c_2r_2^n+...+c_kr_k^n$ for some scalars $c_1, ..., c_n$. (The case of repeated roots is similar but we won't cover it here; see any text on Discrete Mathematics.)  Now we bring in the initial conditions. Use them to solve for $c_1$, ..., $c_n$. For instance, the polynomial associated with the Fibonacci relation is $-λ^2+λ+1$, whose roots are $r_1=(1+√{5})/2$ and $r_2=(1-√{5})/2$ and so any solution of the Fibonacci recurrence has the form $f(n)=c_1((1+√{5})/2)^n+c_2((1-√{5})/2)^n$. Use the Fibonacci initial conditions for $n=0$ and $n=1$ $ $ c_1 + c_2 = 0 (1+√{5}/2)c_1 + (1-√{5}/2)c_2 = 1 $ $ and solve to get $c_1=1/√{5}$ and $c_2=-1/√{5}$, as we found above.  We close by considering the nonhomogeneous case, where the relation has the form $f(n+1)=a_nf(n)+a_{n-1}f(n-1)+...+a_{n-k}f(n-k)+b$ for some nonzero $b$. We only need a small adjustment to make the transition from the homogeneous case.  This classic example illustrates: in 1883, Edouard Lucas posed the Tower of Hanoi problem.   In the great temple at Benares, beneath the dome which marks the center of the world, rests a brass plate in which are fixed three diamond needles, each a cubit high and as thick as the body of a bee. On one of these needles, at the creation, God placed sixty four disks of pure gold, the largest disk resting on the brass plate, and the others getting smaller and smaller up to the top one. This is the Tower of Brahma. Day and night unceasingly the priests transfer the disks from one diamond needle to another according to the fixed and immutable laws of Bram-ah, which require that the priest on duty must not move more than one disk at a time and that he must place this disk on a needle so that there is no smaller disk below it. When the sixty-four disks shall have been thus transferred from the needle on which at the creation God placed them to one of the other needles, tower, temple, and Brahmins alike will crumble into dusk, and with a thunderclap the world will vanish. (Translation of from .)  We put aside the question of why the priests don't sit down for a while and have the world last a little longer, and instead ask how many disk moves it will take. Before tackling the sixty~four disk problem we will consider the problem for three disks.  To begin, all three disks are on the same needle.    After the three moves of taking the small disk to the far needle, the mid-sized disk to the middle needle, and then the small disk to the middle needle, we have this.    Now we can move the big disk to the far needle. Then to finish we repeat the three-move process on the two smaller disks, this time so that they end up on the third needle, on top of the big disk.  That sequence of moves is the best that we can do. To move the bottom disk at a minimum we must first move the smaller disks to the middle needle, then move the big one, and then move all the smaller ones from the middle needle to the ending needle. Since this minimum suffices, we get this recurrence. $ T(n)=T(n-1)+1+T(n-1)=2T(n-1)+1 where $T(1)=1$ $ Here are the first few values of $T$.   disks~$n$ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  moves~$T(n)$ 1 3 7 15 31 63 127 255 511 1023   Of course, these numbers are one less than a power of two. To derive this write the original relation as $-1=-T(n)+2T(n-1)$. Consider $0=-T(n)+2T(n-1)$, a linear homogeneous recurrence of order~$1$. Its associated polynomial is $-λ+2$, with the single root $r_1=2$. Thus functions satisfying the homogeneous relation take the form $c_12^n$.  That's the homogeneous solution. Now we need a particular solution. Because the nonhomogeneous relation $-1=-T(n)+2T(n-1)$ is so simple, we can by eye spot a particular solution $T(n)=-1$. Any solution of the recurrence $T(n)=2T(n-1)+1$ (without initial conditions) is the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution: $c_12^n-1$. Now the initial condition $T(1)=1$ gives that $c_1=1$ and we've gotten the formula that generates the table:~the $n$-disk Tower of Hanoi problem requires $T(n)=2^n-1$ moves.  Finding a particular solution in more complicated cases is, perhaps not surprisingly, more complicated. A delightful and rewarding, but challenging, source is . For more on the Tower of Hanoi see , , and . Some computer code follows the exercises.    How many months until the number of Fibonacci rabbit pairs passes a thousand? Ten thousand? A million?  We use the formula $ F(n)=frac(1){√{5}}[(frac{1+√{5}}{2})^{n} -(frac{1-√{5}}{2})^{n}] $ As observed earlier, $(1+√{5})/2$ is larger than one while $(1+√{5})/2$ has absolute value less than one.  sage: phi = (1+5^(0.5))/2 sage: psi = (1-5^(0.5))/2 sage: phi 1.61803398874989 sage: psi -0.618033988749895  So the value of the expression is dominated by the first term. Solving $1000=(1/√{5})· ((1+√{5})/2)^n$ gives this.  sage: a = ln(1000*5^(0.5))/ln(phi) sage: a 16.0271918385296 sage: psi^(17) -0.000280033582072583  So by the seventeenth power, the second term does not contribute enough to change the roundoff. For the ten thousand and million calculations the situation is even more extreme.  sage: b = ln(10000*5^(0.5))/ln(phi) sage: b 20.8121638053112 sage: c = ln(1000000*5^(0.5))/ln(phi) sage: c 30.3821077388746  The answers in these cases are $21$ and $31$.   Solve each homogeneous linear recurrence relations.  $f(n)=5f(n-1)-6f(n-2)$ $f(n)=4f(n-2)$ $f(n)=5f(n-1)-2f(n-2)-8f(n-3)$     We express the relation in matrix form. $ [f(n) f(n-1)] = ([ 5 -6 1 0 ]) [f(n-1) f(n-2)] $ The characteristic equation of the matrix $ ([ 5-λ -6 1 -λ ]) =λ^2-5λ+6 $ has roots of $2$ and $3$. Any function of the form $f(n)=c_12^n+c_23^n$ satisfies the recurrence.  The matrix expression of the relation is $ [f(n) f(n-1)] = ([ 0 4 1 0 ]) [f(n-1) f(n-2)] $ and the characteristic equation $ ([ λ^2-2 ]) =(λ-2)(λ+2) $ has the two roots $2$ and $-2$. Any function of the form $f(n)=c_12^n+c_2(-2)^n$ satisfies this recurrence.  In matrix form the relation $ [f(n) f(n-1) f(n-2)] = ([ 5 -2 -8 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]) [f(n-1) f(n-2) f(n-3)] $ has a characteristic equation with roots $-1$, $2$, and $4$. Any combination of the form $c_1(-1)^n+c_22^n+c_34^n$ solves the recurrence.    Give a formula for the relations of the prior exercise, with these initial conditions.  $f(0)=1$, $f(1)=1$ $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$ $f(0)=1$, $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$.    The solution of the homogeneous recurrence is $f(n)=c_12^n+c_23^n$. Substituting $f(0)=1$ and $f(1)=1$ gives this linear system. $ $ c_1 + c_2 = 1 2c_1 + 3c_2 = 1 $ $ By eye we see that $c_1=2$ and $c_2=-1$.  The solution of the homogeneous recurrence is $c_12^n+c_2(-2)^n$. The initial conditions give this linear system. $ $ c_1 + c_2 = 0 2c_1 - 2c_2 = 1 $ $ The solution is $c_1=1/4$, $c_2=-1/4$.  The homogeneous recurrence has the solution $f(n)=c_1(-1)^n+c_22^n+c_34^n$. With the initial conditions we get this linear system. $ $ c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 1 -c_1 + 2c_2 + 4c_3 = 1 c_1 + 4c_2 + 16c_3 = 3 $ $ Its solution is $c_1=1/3$, $c_2=2/3$, $c_3=0$.    Check that the isomorphism given between $S$ and $ ℝ^k$ is a linear map.    Fix a linear homogeneous recurrence of order~$k$. Let $S$ be the set of functions $f: ℕ → ℂ$ satisfying the recurrence. Consider the function $Phi: S → ℂ^k$ given as here. $ fPhi↓[f(0) f(1) ... f(k-1)] $ This shows linearity. $ Phi(a· f_1+b· f_2) = [af_1(0)+bf_2(0) ... af_1(k-1)+bf_2(k-1)] = a[f_1(0) ... f_1(k-1)] + b[f_2(0) ... f_2(k-1)] =a· Phi(f_1)+b· Phi(f_2) $   Show that the characteristic equation of the matrix is as stated, that is, is the polynomial associated with the relation. (Hint: expanding down the final column and using induction will work.)  We use the hint to prove this. $ 0 = ([ a_{n-1}-λ a_{n-2} a_{n-3} ... a_{n-k+1} a_{n-k} 1 -λ 0 ... 0 0 0 1 -λ 0 0 1 ... ... ... ... 0 0 0 ... 1 -λ ]) =(-1)^{k-1}(-λ^k+a_{n-1}λ^{k-1}+a_{n-2}λ^{k-2} +...+a_{n-k+1}λ+a_{n-k}) =±(-λ^k+a_{n-1}λ^{k-1}+a_{n-2}λ^{k-2} +...+a_{n-k+1}λ+a_{n-k}) $ The base step is trivial. For the inductive step, expanding down the final column gives two nonzero terms. $ (-1)^{k-1}a_{n-k}· 1 -λ· ([ a_{n-1}-λ a_{n-2} a_{n-3} ... a_{n-k+1} 1 -λ 0 ... 0 0 1 -λ 0 0 1 ... ... ... 0 0 0 ... 1 ]) $ (The matrix is square so the sign in front of $-λ$ is $-1^{even}$). Application of the inductive hypothesis gives the desired result. $ =(-1)^{k-1}a_{n-k}· 1 -λ· (-1)^{k-2}(-λ^{k-1}+a_{n-1}λ^{k-2}+a_{n-2}λ^{k-3} +...+a_{n-k+1}λ^0) $   Given a homogeneous linear recurrence relation $f(n)=a_nf(n-1)+...+a_{n-k}f(n-k)$, let $r_1$, ..., $r_k$ be the roots of the associated polynomial. Prove that each function $f_{r_i}(n)=r_k^n$ satisfies the recurrence (without initial conditions).  This is a straightforward induction on $n$.   (This refers to the value $T(64)=18,446,744,073,709,551,615$ given in the computer code below.) Transferring one disk per second, how many years would it take the priests at the Tower of Hanoi to finish the job?

It is in the Scheme dialect of LISP, specifically, .  After loading an extension that keeps the computer from switching to floating point numbers when the integers get large, the Tower of Hanoi function is straightforward.  (require-extension numbers)  (define (tower-of-hanoi-moves n) (if (= n 1) 1 (+ (* (tower-of-hanoi-moves (- n 1)) 2) 1) ) )  ; Two helper funcitons (define (first-few-outputs proc n) (first-few-outputs-aux proc n '()) )  (define (first-few-outputs-aux proc n lst) (if (< n 1) lst (first-few-outputs-aux proc (- n 1) (cons (proc n) lst)) ) )  (For readers unused to recursive code:~to compute $T(64)$, the computer wants to compute $2*T(63)-1$, which requires computing $T(63)$. The computer puts the `times $2$' and the `plus $1$' aside for a moment. It computes $T(63)$ by using this same piece of code (that's what `recursive' means), and to do that it wants to compute $2*T(62)-1$. This keeps up until, after $63$ steps, the computer tries to compute $T(1)$. It then returns $T(1)=1$, which allows the computation of $T(2)$ to proceed, etc., until the original computation of $T(64)$ finishes.)  The helper functions give a table of the first few values.

This is a Wilberforce pendulum. Hanging on the spring is a mass, or bob. Push it up a bit and release, and it will oscillate up and down.    But then, if the device is properly adjusted, something fascinating happens. After a few seconds, in addition to going up and down, the mass begins to rotate about the axis that runs up the middle of the spring. This yaw increases until the motion becomes almost entirely rotary, with very little up and down. Perhaps five seconds later the motion evolves back to a combination. After some more time, order reappears. Amazingly, now the motion is almost entirely vertical. This continues, with the device trading off periods of pure vertical motion with periods of pure rotational motion, interspersed with mixtures. (Search online for ``wilberforce pendulum video'' to get some excellent demonstrations.)  Each pure motion state is a normal mode of oscillation. We will analyze this device's behavior when it is in a normal mode. It is all about eigenvalues.      Write~$x(t)$ for the vertical motion over time and $θ(t)$ for the rotational motion. Fix the coordinate system so that in rest position $x=0$ and~$θ=0$, so that positive $x$'s are up, and so that positive $θ$'s are counterclockwise when viewed from above.  We start by modeling the motion of a mass on a spring constrained to have no twist. This is simpler because there is only one motion, one degree of freedom. Put the mass in rest position and push it up to compress the spring. Hooke's Law is that for small distances the restoring force is proportional to the distance, $F=-k· x$. The constant~$k$ is the stiffness of the spring.  Newton's Law is that a force is proportional to the associated acceleration $F=m· d^2x(t)/dt$. The constant of proportionality, $m$, is the mass of the object. Combining Hooke's Law with Newton's gives the differential equation expressing the mass's motion $m· d^2x(t)/dt=-k· x(t)$. We prefer the form with the variables all on one side. $ m· (d^2x(t)/dt)+k· x(t)=0  $  Our physical intuition is that over time the bob oscillates. It started high so the graph should look like this.    Of course, this looks like a cosine graph and we recognize that the differential equation of motion~($*$) is satisfied by $x(t)=cos(ω) t$, where $ω=√{m/k}$, since $dx/dt=ω· sin(ω) t$ and $d^2x/dt^2=-ω^2· cos(ω) t$. Here, $ω$ is the angular frequency. It governs the period of the oscillation since if $ω=1$ then the period is~$2π$, while if $ω=2$ then the period is~$π$, etc.  We can give a more general solution of~($*$). For a general amplitude we put a factor~$A$ in front $x(t)=A· cos(wt)$. And we can allow a phase shift, so we are not required to start the clock when the mass is high, with $x(t)=Acos(wt+φ)$. This is the equation of simple harmonic motion.  Now back to consideration of the coupled pair of motions, vertical and rotational. These two interact because a spring that is twisted will lengthen or shorten just a bit; for instance, it could work as here or could be reversed, depending on the spring.    And, a spring that is stretched or compressed from its rest position will twist slightly. The interaction of the two produces coupled oscillations.  To see how the interaction can produce the dramatic behavior that we see in a normal mode imagine that the mass is rotating in the direction that will make the spring longer. If at the same moment the vertical motion is that the spring is getting shorter, then superimposing the two could result in their almost canceling. The bob ends up not moving vertically much at all, just twisting. With a properly adjusted device this could last for a number of seconds.  ``Properly adjusted'' means that the period of the pure vertical motion is the same as, or close to, the period of the pure rotational motion. With that, the cancellation will go on for some time.  The interaction between the motions can also produce the other normal mode behavior, where the bob moves mostly vertically without much rotation, if the spring's motion~$x(t)$ produces a twist that opposes the bob's twist~$θ(t)$. The bob will stop rotating, almost, so that its motion is almost entirely vertical.  To get the equations of motion in this two degrees of freedom case, we make the same assumption as in the one degree case, that for small displacements the restoring force is proportional to the displacement. But now we take that assumption both for the vertical motion and for the rotation. Let the constant of proportionality in the rotational motion be~$κ$. Similarly we also use Newton's Law that force is proportional to acceleration for the rotational motion as well, and take the constant of proportionality to be~$I$.  Most crucially, we add a coupling between the two motions, which we take to be proportional to each, with constant of proportionality~$ε/2$.  That gives a system of two differential equations, the first for vertical motion and the second for rotation. These equations describe the behavior of the coupled system at any time~$t$. $  m·(d^2x(t)/dt^2) +k· x(t)+(ε/2)· θ(t) =0 I·(d^2θ(t)/dt^2) +κ· θ(t)+(ε/2)· x(t) =0   $ We will use them to analyze the system's behavior at times when it is in a normal mode.  First consider the uncoupled motions, as given by the equations without the $ε$ terms. Without those terms these describe simple harmonic functions, and we write~$ω_x^2$ for~$k/m$, and $ω_θ^2$ for $κ/I$. We have argued above that to observe the stand-still behavior we should adjust the device so that the periods are the same $ω_x^2=ω_θ^2$. Write~$ω_0$ for that number.  Now consider the coupled motions $x(t)$ and~$θ(t)$. By the same principle, to observe the stand-still behavior we want them in in sync, for instance so that the rotation is at its peak when the stretch is at its peak. That is, in a normal mode the oscillations have the same angular frequency~$ω$. As to phase shift, as we also discussed there are two cases: when the twist imparted by the spring's motion is in the same direction as the twist given by the rotational oscillation and when they are opposed. In either case to get a normal mode the peaks must coincide. $ x(t) = A_1cos(ω t+φ) x(t) = A_1cos(ω t+φ) θ(t) = A_2cos(ω t+φ) θ(t) = A_2cos(ω t+(φ+π)) $ We will work through the left-hand case, leaving the other as an exercise.  We want to find which $ω$'s are possible. Take the second derivatives $ (d^2x(t)/dt)=-A_1ω^2cos(ω t+φ)  (d^2θ(t)/dt)=-A_2ω^2cos(ω t+φ) $ and plug into the equations of motion~($**$). $ m·(-A_1ω^2cos(ω t+φ)) +k· (A_1cos(ω t+φ)) +(ε/2)· (A_2cos(ω t+φ)) =0 I·(-A_2ω^2cos(ω t+φ)) +κ· (A_2cos(ω t+φ)) +(ε/2)· (A_1cos(ω t+φ)) =0 $ Factor out $cos(ω t+φ)$ and divide through by~$m$. $ ((k/m)-ω^2)· A_1 +(ε/2m)· A_2 =0 ((κ/I)-ω^2)· A_2 +(ε/2m)· A_1 =0 $ We are assuming that $k/m=ω_{x}^2$ and replace $κ/I=ω_{θ}^2$ are equal, and writing $ω_0^2$ for that number. Make the substitution and restate it as a matrix equation. $ ([ ω_0^2-ω^2 ε/2m ε/2I ω_0^2-ω^2 ]) colvec{ A_1 A_2} = ([ 0 0 ]) $ Obviously this system has the trivial solution~$A_1=0$, $A_2=0$, for the case where the mass is at rest. We want to know for which frequencies~$ω$ this system has a nontrivial solution. $ ([ ω_0^2 ε/2m ε/2I ω_0^2 ]) colvec{ A_1 A_2} = ω^2 ([ A_1 A_2 ]) $ The normal mode angular frequencies~$ω$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix.  To calculate it take the determinant and set it to zero. $ ([ ω_0^2-ω^2 ε/2m ε/2I ω_0^2-ω^2 ])=0 --> ω^4-(2ω_0^2)ω^2 +(ω_0^4 -(ε^2/4mI))=0 $ That equation is quadratic in~$ω^2$. Apply the formula to solve quadratic equations, $(-b±√{b^2-4ac})/(2a)$. $ ω^2 =frac{2ω_0^2 ±√{smash[b]{strut} 4ω_0^4 -4(ω_0^4-ε^2/4mI)}}{2} =ω_0^2±frac(ε){2√{mI}} $ The value $ε/√{mI}=ε/√{κ k}$ is often written $ω_B$ so that $ ω^2 =ω_0^2±ω_B/2 $. This is the beat frequency, the difference between the two normal mode frequencies.  Although the argument is beyond our scope, the general formula for the motion of the pendulum is a linear combination of the motions during the normal modes. Thus, the pendulum's motion is entirely determined by the eigenvalues of the above matrix. See .   Use the formula for the cosine of a sum to give an even more general formula for simple harmonic motion.  The angle sum formula for the cosine function is $cos(α+β)=cos(α)cos(β)-sin(α)sin(β)$. Expand $Acos(ω t+φ)$ to $A·[cos(ω t)cos(φ)-sin(ω t)sin(φ)]$. Then $cos(φ)$ and $sin(φ)$ do not vary with~$t$ so we get the general solution $x(t)=Bcos(ω t)+Csin(ω t)$.  Find the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues.  We will do the first root; the second is similar. We have this equation. $ ([ ω_0^2-ω^2 ε/2m ε/2I ω_0^2-ω^2 ]) [A_1 A_2] =[0 0] $ Plug in the first root~$ω^2=ω_0^2+ε/2√{mI}$. The two equations are redundant so we just consider the first. $ -(ε/2√{mI})· A_1+(ε/2m)· A_2=0 $ That's a line through the origin in the plane, so to specify it we need only find the ratio between the first and second variables. $ (A_2/A_1)=frac{(ε/2√{mI})}{(ε/2m)} =√{(m/I)} $ So this is the space of eigenvectors associated with the first eigenvalue. $ {[A_1 √{{m/I]· A_1} such that A_1 in ℂ} $  Find the values of $ω$ in the case where $x(t)=A_1cos(ω t+φ)$ and $θ(t)=A_2cos(ω t+(φ+π))$.  Observe that $cos(ω t+(φ+π))=-cos(ω t+φ)$. Take the derivatives $ (dx(t)/dt)=-ω·sin(ω t+φ)  (d^2x(t)/dt^2)=-ω^2·cos(ω t+φ) $ and $ (dθ(t)/dt)=ω·sin(ω t+φ)  (d^2θ(t)/dt^2)=ω^2·cos(ω t+φ) $ and plug into the equations of motion~($**$). $ mA_1·(-ω^2cos(ω t+φ)) +kA_1· (cos(ω t+φ)) +(ε/2)A_2· (-cos(ω t+φ)) =0 IA_2·(ω^2cos(ω t+φ)) +κ A_2· (-cos(ω t+φ)) +(ε/2)A_1· (cos(ω t+φ)) =0 $ Factor out $cos(ω t+φ)$ $ (m(-ω^2))· A_1 +kA_1 -(ε/2)· A_2 =0 (Iω^2)· A_2 -κ A_2 +(ε/2)· A_1 =0 $ and divide through by~$m$ and~$I$. $ ((k/m)-ω^2)· A_1 -(ε/2m)· A_2 =0 (ε/2I)· A_1 -((κ/I)-ω^2)· A_2 =0 $ We are assuming that $k/m=ω_{x}^2$ and $κ/I=ω_{θ}^2$ are equal, and writing $ω_0^2$ for that number. Make the substitution and restate it as a matrix equation. $ ([ ω_0^2-ω^2 -ε/2m ε/2I ω_0^2-ω^2 ]) colvec{ A_1 A_2} = colvec{ 0 0} $ We want the frequencies~$ω$ for which this system has a nontrivial solution. $ ([ ω_0^2-ω^2 -ε/2m ε/2I ω^2-ω_0^2 ]) =0 $ This is the same determinant as we did in the Topic body except that the second column is multiplied by $-1$. Multiplying a row or column by a scalar multiplies the entire determinant by that scalar. So this determinant is the negative of the one in the Topic body. But we are setting it to zero so that doesn't matter. The roots are the same as in the Topic body.  Build a Wilberforce pendulum out of a Slinky Jr and a soup can. You can drill holes in the can for bolts, either two or four of them, that you can use to adjust the moment of inertia of the can so the periods of vertical and rotational motion coincide.  See .             }  The first chapter covers the dot product operation. It inputs a pair of vectors from some $R^n$ and outputs a scalar. $ [-1 2 3]dot product of [1 0 3] =-1· 1+2· 0+3· 3 =8 $ In that chapter we did not yet have the term `linear', but this operation respects both addition $ (vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2)dot product of vec(w)=vec(v)_1dot product of vec(w) +vec(v)_2dot product of vec(w)  vec(v)dot product of (vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2)=vec(v)dot product of vec(w)_1 +vec(v)dot product of vec(w)_2 $ and scalar multiplication. $ (rvec(v))dot product of vec(w)=r(vec(v)dot product of vec(w))  vec(v)dot product of (rvec(w))=r(vec(v)dot product of vec(w)) $  One interesting thing about the dot product operation is that it describes the geometry of $ ℝ^n$. Examples are that two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero, and that the length of a vector is determined by $vec(v)dot product of vec(v)=|vec(v)|^2$. Here we will extend this operation, and with it lengths, to other vector spaces. We will use the traditional mathematical notation for the extension, which is not a dot but instead is $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}$.  To motivate the definition, we need more on complex numbers than we reviewed in this chapter's opening section. There, we described~$ ℂ$ as the collection of $z=a+bi$ where $a$ and~$b$ are real numbers, and where $i^2=-1$. We also covered addition, scalar multiplication, subtraction, and multiplication, as well as length. As for division, consider $z=(1+2i)/(3+4i)$. The difference of squares formula gives $(a+bi)(a-bi)=a^2-(bi)^2=a^2-(-b^2)=a^2+b^2$, which is a real number. So, multiplying $z$'s numerator and denominator by $3-4i$ gives an $a+bi$ expression. $ z=(1+2i/3+4i)·(3-4i/3-4i) = ((1· 3+2· 4)+(1· (-4)+2· 3)i/3^2+4^2) = (11+2i/25) = (11/25)+(2/25)i $ With that computation in mind, we define the conjugate of a complex number~$z$ to be $z̅=a+bi̅=a-bi$, so that $zz̅=|z|^2$. Dividing that equation by $|z|^2$ gives $zz̅/|z|^2=1$ and so every nonzero complex number has a multiplicative inverse, $z^{-1}=z̅/|z|^2$.  Observe that a complex number is a real number if and only if it equals its conjugate, that $z_1+z_2̅=z_1̅+z_2̅$, and that $z_1· z_2̅=z_1̅·z_2̅$. Plotting $z=a+bi$ on the complex plane illustrates the conjugate.    This picture makes clear that $z+z̅=(a+bi)+(a-bi)$ equals $2· a$, which we write as $2· ℝ{z}$. (Read `$ ℝ{z}$' aloud as ``the real part of $z$.'')    We are ready to generalize the dot product and length operations. Dot product and length are familiar in spaces that are collections of real column vectors but we have seen many examples of vector spaces far removed from those, such as the spaces of polynomials, $polyspace(_n)$. In such a space it is not obvious what would be a useful or natural definition of length. For some insight into what to do, consider the complex vector spaces~$ ℂ^n$.  With dot product in real spaces in mind, the natural first guess here is to try $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}$ as the linear combination of the components, so that in the~$ ℂ^2$ case $ vec(v)=[a_{1,1]+b_{1,1}i a_{2,1}+b_{2,1}i}  vec(w)=[a_{1,2]+b_{1,2}i a_{2,2}+b_{2,2}i} $ the guess for $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}$ is $(a_{1,1}+b_{1,1}i)·(a_{1,2}+b_{1,2}i)+(a_{2,1}+b_{2,1}i)·(a_{2,2}+b_{2,2}i)$. But this won't do. We are investigating lengths, so we want that $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}=|vec(v)|^2$, and thus we don't want that $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}$ equals $(a_1+b_1i)(a_1+b_1i)+(a_2+b_2i)(a_2+b_2i)$. Instead we want something like $(a_1+b_1i)(a_1-b_1i)+(a_2+b_2i)(a_2-b_2i)$. Consequently, we adopt this definition for $ ℂ^2$. $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)} =(a_{1,1}+b_{1,1}i)·(a_{1,2}-b_{1,2}i)+(a_{2,1}+b_{2,1}i)·(a_{2,2}-b_{2,2}i) $ The Hermitian inner product is: where vectors $vec(v),vec(w) in ℂ^n$ have components $v_0$, ...~$v_n$ and $w_0$, ...~$w_n$, then $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}=v_1w̅_1+·s+v_nw̅_n$. Notice that this extends the dot product in the sense that if we fall back to reals, taking the $b$'s be zero, then it equals $vec(v)dot product of vec(w)$.  This operation inputs two vectors but outputs a scalar. Here is an example. $ innerprod{[1+2i 3+4i]}{[5+6i 7+8i]} =(1+2i)(5-6i)+(3+4i)(7-8i) [-2ex] =(17+4i)+(53+4i)=70+8i $  Hermitian inner product is linear in the first input:~checking that $ innerprod{vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2}{vec(w)} = innerprod{vec(v)_1}{vec(w)} + innerprod{vec(v)_2}{vec(w)}$ and that $ innerprod{z·vec(v)}{vec(w)} =z· innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}$ is straightforward. But it is not linear in the second because while $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)_1+vec(w)_2} = innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)_1} + innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)_2}$ holds, for scalar multiplication a conjugation appears: $ innerprod{vec(v)}{z·vec(w)} =z̅· innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}$. Of course, this difference is here because in the definition the second input is conjugated while the first is not. Another result of this asymmetry is that $ innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(v)} ≠ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}$; rather, $ innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(v)}=compconj{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}}$.  Hermitian inner product is one way, in a particular set of vector spaces, to extend dot product. There are lots of others, in lots of spaces. But we want our extensions to lead to a reasonable notion of length. For that, an inner product is an operation that inputs two vectors from a real or complex vector space and outputs a scalar, and that satisfies three conditions. Condition~(1) is that it is linear in the first input, so $ innerprod{vec(v)_1+vec(v)_2}{vec(w)} = innerprod{vec(v)_1}{vec(w)} + innerprod{vec(v)_2}{vec(w)}$ and $ innerprod{zvec(v)}{vec(w)} =z innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}$.    Condition~(2) is that $ innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(v)}=compconj{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}}$. Observe that as a consequence, $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}$ equals its conjugate and so is a real number. Condition~(3) says about that real number that $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}≥ 0$ for all $vec(v)$, with $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}= 0$ if and only if $vec(v)=0$.  A vector space along with an inner product operation is an inner product space. (In the prior paragraph we used the $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}$ notation for any inner product at all, while earlier we used it for the specific case of the Hermetian inner product. This duplication won't cause confusion because in an inner product space there is exactly one such operation, so there will never be several to tell apart.)  Each real vector space $R^n$ along with dot product is an inner product space. Hermitian inner product makes any complex vector space~$ ℂ^n$ into an inner product space. The verification of each is in the exercises.  An example which looks quite different is the real vector space whose members are real valued functions that are continuous on the closed interval $[0, 1]$. Let the inner product be this. $ innerprod{f}{g}= int_{0}^1 f(t)· g(t)dt $ This satisfies the inner product definition condition~(1) because $ int_{0}^1 (f_1(t)+f_2(t))· g(t)dt$ equals $ int_{0}^1 f_1(t)g(t)dt+ int_{0}^1 f_2(t)g(t)dt$ by a result from elementary Calculus, and a similar result holds for scalar multiplication. It satisfies~(2) because for real numbers conjugation has no effect, and $f(t)g(t)$ equals $g(t)f(t)$. For condition~(3), if~$f$ is not the zero function then the square $f(t)· f(t)$ is greater than~$0$ for some $t̂ in [0, 1]$. By continuity then, the square is greater than zero for a subinterval around~$t̂$, and so the area under the curve is greater than~$0$.  We next generalize the length operation. We shall consider an operation to be a reasonable extension of length if it inputs vectors and outputs real numbers and if it satisfies three conditions; any such operation we shall call a norm, and denote~$norm{vec(v)}$. The first condition is that $norm{vec(v)}≥ 0$, and that $norm{vec(v)}= 0$ if and only if $vec(v)=0$. The second is that rescaling a vector will rescale its norm, specifically that $norm{z· vec(v)}=|z|·norm{vec(v)}$. The third condition is the Triangle Inequality, that $norm{vec(v)+vec(w)}≤norm{vec(v)}+norm{vec(w)}$.  A familiar example of a norm in the vector space~$R^n$ is the ordinary Euclidean length, $norm{vec(v)}=√{v_1^2+·s+v_n^2}$.  Another example is on the real vector space of matrices $matspace(_){N by M}$. Let the norm of a matrix, $‖M‖$, be the largest absolute value over all of the entries. Condition~(1) is clear, as is condition~(2). Condition~(3) is the ordinary Triangle Inequality for reals, $|a+b|≤|a|+|b|$.            In the motivation of the definition of inner product, we said that we want our extension of dot product to yield a reasonable notion of length. We now have the definitions that we need to make that precise. Let $norm{vec(v)}=√{smashdp{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}}}$. We will show that this satisfies the three conditions in the definition of a norm. We covered the first condition in the discussion of inner product. To verify the second, $norm{z·vec(v)} =√{smashdp{ innerprod{zvec(v)}{zvec(v)}}} =√{smashdp{zz̅· innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}}} =√{zz̅}·√{smashdp{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}}} =|z|·√{smashdp{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}}}$.  For the third condition we will again, as in the first chapter, relate it to the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality, $absval{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}}≤ norm{vec(v)}·norm{vec(w)}$. The proof of the inequality here is an extension of, but more involved than, the proof in the first chapter. Consider the difference $vec(v)-z·vec(w)$ as $z in ℂ$ varies. This vector's norm is a nonnegative real, $0≤ norm{vec(v)-z·vec(w)}^2 = innerprod{vec(v)-zvec(w)}{vec(v)-zvec(w)}$. Linearity gives $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)-zvec(w)} -z· innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(v)-zvec(w)}$ and then $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)} -z̅· innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)} -z· innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(v)} +zz̅· innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(w)}$. We have this for all $z in ℂ$. $ 0 ≤ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)} -z̅· innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)} -z·compconj{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}} +zz̅· innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(w)} $  Take $z= innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}/ innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(w)}$ (if $vec(w)=0$ then the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality is trivial, so we ignore this case). Its denominator is a real number so $z̅=compconj{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}}/ innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(w)}$, and thus plugging it into the second term gives $compconj{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}} innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}/ innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(w)}$. Plugging into the third term gives the same, as does plugging into the last term. Combining the three like terms gives this. $ 0 ≤ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)} -frac{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}compconj{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}}}{ innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(w)}} =norm{vec(v)}^2 -frac{absval{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}}^2}{norm{vec(w)}^2} $ Rearranging and clearing the denominator gives the desired inequality.  With that, we can prove the Triangle Inequality. Again, this extends the argument in the first chapter. $ norm{vec(v)+vec(w)}^2 = innerprod{vec(v)+vec(w)}{vec(v)+vec(w)} = innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)} + innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)} + innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(v)} + innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(w)} =norm{vec(v)}^2 + innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)} +compconj{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}} +norm{vec(w)}^2 =norm{vec(v)}^2 +2· ℝ{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}} +norm{vec(w)}^2 ≤norm{vec(v)}^2 +2absval{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}} +norm{vec(w)}^2  intertext{Apply Cauchy-Schwartz.} ≤norm{vec(v)}^2 +2·norm{vec(v)}·norm{vec(w)} +norm{vec(w)}^2 =(norm{vec(v)}+norm{vec(w)})^2 $ Taking the square root of both sides gives the result.  We pause to see one more connection between inner products, norm, and geometry. Here is the familiar parallelogram diagram for the sum of two vectors, where besides $vec(v)+vec(w)$ we also show $vec(v)-vec(w)$.    We will prove the parallelogram identity, $|vec(v)+vec(w)|^2+|vec(v)-vec(w)|^2=2|vec(v)|^2+2|vec(w)|^2$ (This has the nice statement that in a parallelogram the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals the sum of the squares of the sides.) Although the drawing above shows the plane, where we usually use dot product notation and write length as $|vec(v)|$, here we will use the notation for inner product and norm.  As above, expand $ norm{vec(v)+vec(w)}^2= innerprod{vec(v)+vec(w)}{vec(v)+vec(w)} $ by using additivity of the first input and then the second. $ norm{vec(v)+vec(w)}^2 = innerprod{vec(v)+vec(w)}{vec(v)+vec(w)}  = innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)} + innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)} + innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(v)} + innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(w)} =norm{vec(v)}^2 + innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)} + innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(v)} +norm{vec(w)}^2 $ The same expansion for $ innerprod{vec(v)-vec(w)}{vec(v)-vec(w)}$ gives this. $ norm{vec(v)-vec(w)}^2 = innerprod{vec(v)-vec(w)}{vec(v)-vec(w)} =norm{vec(v)}^2 - innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)} - innerprod{vec(w)}{vec(v)} +norm{vec(w)}^2 $ Adding the two gives the desired result.  Now, with the inner product and norm operations, even in spaces where there is no obvious geometry we can interpret geometric ideas. An example is that can generalize distance to a metric operation $d(vec(v),vec(w))=norm{vec(v)-vec(w)}$. Another example is that we can say that vectors $vec(v)$ and~$vec(w)$ are orthogonal when $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}=0$, and we can extend the Gram-Schmidt process to any finite dimensional inner product space.  A technical comment:~we have defined a norm operation from the inner product, as $norm{vec(v)}=√{smashdp{ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}}}$, and then derived the parallelogram identity. Also true is that if a norm satisfies this identity then it arises from an inner product, as $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)} =(1/2)·(norm{vec(v)+vec(w)}^2-norm{vec(v)}^2-norm{vec(w)}^2)$. However, the proof is beyond our scope.  A norm does not arise from an inner product can happen; we saw one above. On the real vector space $matspace(_){N by N}$, let the norm of a matrix $‖M‖$ be the largest absolute value of any entry. Consider these matrices. $ M_1= ([ 1 2 3 4 ])  M_2= ([ 8 7 6 5 ]) $ Obviously, $‖M_1‖=4$ and~$‖M_2‖=8$. Also easy to check are that $‖M_1+M_2‖=9$ and $‖M_1-M_2‖=7$. Thus $‖M_1+M_2‖^2+‖M_1-M_2‖^2=130$, while $2(‖M_1‖^2+‖M_2‖^2)=160$, and they are unequal.  We close with a remark about our definition of inner product. Some authors, particularly in physics, define the inner product so that it is linear in the second argument instead of the first. Where we write $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}$, these authors write $langle(y) | xrangle$. This is the bra-ket notation that is standard in quantum mechanics.    Verify that $R^n$ along with dot product is an inner product space.  The opening paragraph of this Topic notes that dot product is linear in both inputs, and so the first condition is satisfied. Condition~(2) concerns conjugation, which has no effect on reals, and so this condition is trivially satisfied. Condition~(3) requires that the length (the ordinary Euclidean length in $n$-dimensional real space) be zero if and only if the vector is~$0$. If the vector has components $v_1$, ...~$v_n$ then $v_1^2+·s v_n^2=0$ if and only if all the components are zero.    Show that Hermitian inner product on the two-dimensional vector space~$ ℂ^2$ satisfies the three conditions in the definition of inner product.  The development in the Topic body proves~(1) and~(2). For~(3), suppose that two members $vec(v),vec(w)$ of~$ ℂ^n$ have $i$-th components $v_i$ and $w_i$, so that $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}=v_1w̅_1+·s+v_nw̅_n$. Then $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}=v_1v̅_1+·s+v_nv̅_n$ equals $|vec(v)_1|^2+·s |vec(v)_n|^2$, which clearly equals~$0$ if and only if each component is~$0$.   Show that this operation is an inner product on the real vector space $matspace(_){N by N}$. $ innerprod{ ([ a b c d ]) }{ ([ e f g h ]) } = ae+bf+cg+dh $  Condition~(1), linearity in the first argument, is easy. $ innerprod{ ([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ]) + ([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ]) }{ ([ e f g h ]) }  =(a_1+a_2)e+(b_1+b_2)f+(c_1+c_2)g+(d_1+d_2)h =(a_1e+b_1f+c_1g+d_1h)+(a_2e+b_2f+c_2g+d_2h) = innerprod{ ([ a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ]) }{ ([ e f g h ]) } + innerprod{ ([ a_2 b_2 c_2 d_2 ]) }{ ([ e f g h ]) }  $ Scalar multiplication is just as routine. Condition~(2) concerns conjugation, which has no effect on reals and so this condition is trivially satisfied. For~(3), of course $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2≥ 0$, with equality if and only if each entry is zero.   Consider the real vector space of quadratic polynomials~$polyspace(_2)$. Show that this is an inner product operation: $ innerprod{a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0}{b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0}=a_2b_2+a_1b_1+a_0b_0$. Consider the resulting norm. What is $‖x^2-1‖$?  Condition~(1) is that it is linear in the first input. Verifying that this operation respects addition is routine $ innerprod{(a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0)+(c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0)}{b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0}  =(a_2+c_2)b_2+(a_1+c_1)b_1+(a_0+c_0)b_0 =(a_2b_2+a_1b_1+a_0b_0)+(c_2b_2+c_1b_1+c_0b_0) = innerprod{(a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0)}{b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0} + innerprod{(c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0)}{b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0}  $ as is verifying that it respects scalar multiplication. Because this is a real vector space, and conjugation has no effect on real number scalars, it satisfies condition~(2). For condition~(3), let $vec(v)=a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$. Then $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}=a_2^2+a_1^2+a_0^2$ is clearly non-negative, and is equal to~$0$ if and only if $vec(v)$ is the zero polynomial.  As to the norm of $x^2-1$, we have this. $ ‖x^2-1‖=√{ innerprod{x^2-1}{x^2-1}}=√{1^2+0^2+(-1)^2}=√{2} $   Verify that the set of real valued functions that are continuous on the closed interval $[0, 1]$ is a vector space.  The ten conditions in the definition of a vector space are consequences of results from Calculus. For example, the first condition is closure under addition and we have that the sum of two continuous functions is a continuous function in Calculus. (Although, often a student does not see a completely precise proof until a later class.) Similarly, addition of two functions is commutative. Of course, the zero vector is the function $f(x)=0$, which is continuous.     Show that an attempted definition of $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(w)}$ on $ ℂ^n$ that is linear in both inputs loses that $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}$ gives the length.  Suppose that $ innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}$ is greater than or equal to~$0$ for all complex vectors~$vec(v)$. Then linearity in both inputs gives $0≤ innerprod{ivec(v)}{ivec(v)} =i innerprod{vec(v)}{ivec(v)} =i^2 innerprod{vec(v)}{vec(v)}≤ 0$.                            --Refer to Topic on Geometry of Linear Transformations---  The characterization of linear transformations in terms of the elementary operations is nice in some ways (for instance, we can easly see that lines are mapped to lines because each of the operations of projection, dilation, reflection, and skew maps lines to lines), but when a map is expressed as a composition of many small operations---no matter how simple---the description is less than ideal. We finish with another way, a somewhat more holistic way, of picturing the geometric effect of transformations of $ ℝ^2$.  The pictures in that area give the action of the map on just one or two members of the domain. Although we know that a transformation is described completely by its action on a basis, and so to describe a transformation of $ ℝ^2$ therefore, strictly speaking, requires only a description of where it sends the two vectors from any basis, those pictures seem not to convey much geometric intution. Can we make clear a linear map's geometry by putting in more information, but not so much information that the picture gets confused?  A transformation of $ ℝ^2$ sends lines through the origin to lines thru the origin. Thus, two points on a line $y=k_1x$ will both be sent to the line, say, $y=k_2x$. Consider two such points. One is a multiple of the other, so we can write them with the second one as $r$ times the first, for some scalar $r$. $ [x k_1x] and [(rx) k_1(rx)] $ Compare their images. $ ([ a c b d ]) [x k_1x] = [ax+ck_1x bx+dk_1x]  ([ a c b d ]) [(rx) k_1(rx)] = [a(rx)+ck_1(rx) b(rx)+dk_1(rx)] $ The second vector is $r$ times the first, and the image of the second is $r$ times the image of the first. Not only does the transformation preserve the fact that the vectors are colinear, it also preserves the relative scale of the vectors. That is, a transformation treats the points on a line through the origin uniformily. To describe the effect of the map on the entire line, we need only describe its effect on a single non-zero point in that line.  Since every point in the space is on some line through the origin, to understand the action of a linear transformation of $ ℝ^2$, it is sufficient to pick one point from each line through the origin (say the point that is on the upper half of the unit circle) and show how the map's effect on that set of points.  Here is such a picture for a straightforward dilation.  psset{xunit=8pt,yunit=8pt,linewidth=.4pt,arrowsize=.5pt 2.5,arrowinset=.1, arrowlength=1.75} pspicture(-3,-1)(3,2) psaxes[labels=none,linecolor=weakgray,tickstyle=bottom, ticks=all,ticksize=1.5pt]{<->}(0,0)(-2.75,-.75)(2.75,1.75) parametricplot[plotstyle=curve,linewidth=.6pt] {0}{180}{t cos t sin} endpspicture raisebox(12pt){[t] $-->$ { $[x y] ↦ [2x y]$} } pspicture(-3,-1)(3,2) psaxes[labels=none,linecolor=weakgray,tickstyle=bottom, ticks=all,ticksize=1.5pt]{<->}(0,0)(-2.75,-.75)(2.75,1.75) parametricplot[plotstyle=curve,linewidth=.6pt] {0}{180}{2 t cos mul t sin} endpspicture  Below, the same map is shown with the circle and its image superimposed.  psset{xunit=12pt,yunit=12pt,linewidth=.4pt,arrowsize=.5pt 2.5,arrowinset=.1, arrowlength=1.75} pspicture(-3,-1)(3,2) psaxes[labels=none,linecolor=weakgray,tickstyle=bottom, ticks=all,ticksize=1.5pt]{<->}(0,0)(-2.75,-.75)(2.75,1.75) parametricplot[plotstyle=curve,linecolor=preimagegray,linewidth=.6pt] {0}{180}{t cos t sin} psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(-1,0)(-2,0) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(-.707,.707)(-1.414,.707) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(.707,.707)(1.414,.707) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(1,0)(2,0) parametricplot[plotstyle=curve,linewidth=.6pt] {0}{180}{2 t cos mul t sin} endpspicture  Certainly the geometry here is more evident. For example, we can see that some lines through the origin are actually sent to themselves:~the $x$-axis is sent to the $x$-axis, and the $y$-axis is sent to the $y$-axis.  This is the flip shown earlier, here with the circle and its image superimposed.  psset{xunit=12pt,yunit=12pt,linewidth=.4pt,arrowsize=.5pt 2.5,arrowinset=.1, arrowlength=1.75} pspicture(-3,-2)(3,2) psaxes[labels=none,linecolor=weakgray,tickstyle=bottom, ticks=all,ticksize=1.5pt]{<->}(0,0)(-2.75,-1.75)(2.75,1.75) parametricplot[plotstyle=curve,linecolor=preimagegray,linewidth=.6pt] {0}{180}{t cos t sin} psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(-1,0)(0,-1) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(-.707,.707)(.707,-.707) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(0,1)(1,0)  psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(1,0)(0,1) parametricplot[plotstyle=curve,linewidth=.6pt] {0}{180}{t sin t cos} endpspicture    And this is the skew shown earlier.  psset{xunit=12pt,yunit=12pt,linewidth=.4pt,arrowsize=.5pt 2.5,arrowinset=.1, arrowlength=1.75} pspicture(-3,-2)(3,3) psaxes[labels=none,linecolor=axisgray,tickstyle=bottom, ticks=all,ticksize=1.5pt]{<->}(0,0)(-2.75,-1.75)(2.75,2.75) parametricplot[plotstyle=curve,linecolor=preimagegray,linewidth=.6pt] {0}{180}{t cos t sin} psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(-1,0)(-1,-2) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(-.707,.707)(-.707,-.707)  psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(.707,.707)(.707,2.121) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(1,0)(1,2) parametricplot[plotstyle=curve,linewidth=.6pt] {0}{180}{t cos 2 t cos mul t sin add} endpspicture    Contrast the picture of this map's effect on the unit square with this one.  Here is a somewhat more complicated map (the second coordinate function is the same as the map in the prior picture, but the first coordinate function is different).  psset{xunit=12pt,yunit=12pt,linewidth=.4pt,arrowsize=.5pt 2.5,arrowinset=.1, arrowlength=1.75} pspicture(-3,-2)(3,3) psaxes[labels=none,linecolor=axisgray,tickstyle=bottom, ticks=all,ticksize=1.5pt]{<->}(0,0)(-2.75,-1.75)(2.75,2.75) parametricplot[plotstyle=curve,linecolor=preimagegray,linewidth=.6pt] {0}{180}{t cos t sin} psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(-1,0)(-1,-2) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(-.707,.707)(0,-.707) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(0,1)(1,1) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(.707,.707)(1.414,2.121) psline[linecolor=preimagegray]{->}(1,0)(1,2) parametricplot[plotstyle=curve,linewidth=.6pt] {0}{180}{t cos t sin add 2 t cos mul t sin add} endpspicture    Observe that some vectors are being both dilated and rotated through some angle $ [x 2x]↦[x k_1x] $ while others are just being dilated, not rotated at all. $ [x 3x]↦[x 3x] $   Show the effect each matrix has on the top half of the unit circle.   $([ 1 1 2 2 ])$  $([ 2 3 1 1 ])$  $([ 2 3 1 -1 ])$  Which vectors stay on the same line through the origin?
